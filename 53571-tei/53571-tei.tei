<head>The Principles Of Real Being. IV. Intrinsic Principles of Substance and Suppositum.</head>

<p>
We have briefly shown in the
preceding article that a complete
being, to be a substance and a
suppositum, requires no positive
addition to its three intrinsic principles,
but needs only to be left to
itself. This is, in our opinion, an
obvious truth. But as there are
philosophers of high repute who do
not fully share the same opinion,
and, on the other hand, the notions
of substance and of suppositum are
both intimately connected with
some theological truths which cannot
be well explained without a
distinct knowledge of what these
two notions really imply, we deem
it expedient to enter into a closer
examination of the subject, that
we may better understand by the
light of reason, and confirm by the
weight of authority, the traditional
doctrine on substance and suppositum,
their essential constitution,
formal distinction, and supernatural
separability.
</p>

<p>
Substance is very commonly described
as <q>that which is in itself
and by itself</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>quod in se et per se
subsistit</foreign>. This definition exhibits
the <q>predicamental</q> substance&mdash;that
is, a substance ultimately complete,
which is at the same time
a suppositum also, according to
Aristotle's comprehensive conception
of substance. And it is for
this reason that such a definition is
made up of two members; of which
the first&mdash;viz., <q>that which exists in
itself</q>&mdash;strictly applies to substance
as such; whilst the second&mdash;viz.,
<q>that which subsists by itself</q>&mdash;strictly
refers to the suppositum as
such, and exhibits substance as
possessing its own natural subsistence
or suppositality.
</p>

<p>
Philosophers, when speaking of
things as existing in their natural
state and condition, are wont to say
indiscriminately that substance is
a being which <q>exists in itself,</q> or
a being which <q>subsists by itself.</q>
<pb n='002'/><anchor id='Pg002'/>
This they can do without any
danger of error so long as they
keep within the bounds of pure
nature; since, in the natural order,
anything that exists in itself subsists
by itself, and <hi rend='italic'>vice versa</hi>. But
natural things can, by supernatural
interference, be raised to a mode of
existence transcending their natural
condition, as we know by divine
revelation; and in such a case, the
mode of substance and the mode
of the suppositum must be, and
accordingly are, most carefully distinguished
from one another.
Thus we know by faith that in
Christ our Lord there is the true
substance of a human body and of
a human soul; and nevertheless we
know that his human nature does
not subsist by itself, but by the
Divine Person of the Word. The
obvious inference is that a nature
which exists in itself does not necessarily
subsist by itself; in other
terms, the formality of substance
and the formality of the suppositum
are entirely distinct from one another,
and the one can remain without
the other. <q>What makes substance
to be essentially a substance,</q>
as Suarez remarks, <q>is not its subsisting
<emph>actually</emph> by itself, but its
having an essence to which subsistence
is naturally due&mdash;viz., an
essence which is of itself a sufficient
principle of subsistence.</q><note place='foot'><q>Essentialis ratio substantiæ ut sic non consistit
in <emph>esse per se</emph>, quatenus per hæc verba
describitur ipsum subsistere in actu, sed in hoc
quod habeat talem essentiam, cui debeatur subsistentia,
seu quæ ex se sit sufficiens principium
illius.</q>&mdash;Suarez, <hi rend='italic'>Metaph. Disp.</hi> 34, sect. 8, n. 11.</note> From
this we learn that the words <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>per se
esse</foreign>, or <q>to subsist by itself,</q> are
inserted in the definition of substance,
not to show what substance
as such is, but only to point out
what is naturally due to substance&mdash;viz.,
what accompanies it in its
natural mode of existing. Substance
as such would therefore be sufficiently
characterized by the words,
<q>that which is in itself.</q>
</p>

<p>
Let us now inquire what is the
legitimate meaning of these last
words. A thing is said to exist in
itself which not only has in itself
what is needed for its own sustentation,
but is moreover actually unsustained
by anything lying under
it, while it is itself the first
subject of all its appurtenances.
Such is the legitimate and traditional
meaning of the words, <q>to exist
in itself.</q> Hence substance may
be legitimately defined as <q>a being
which by its intrinsic constitution
has no need of being supported by
a subject, and which is not actually
supported.</q>
</p>

<p>
A living author, however, in a
valuable work to which I have no
access at this moment, and from
which, therefore, I do not make any
quotation <emph>verbatim</emph>, asserts that substance
<q>up to the present day</q>
has always been understood to
mean <q>a thing which by its intrinsic
constitution has no need of being
supported by a subject,</q> without
taking into consideration its
actual mode of existing. We shall
presently show that this assertion
is not true, and that this pretended
definition is essentially incomplete.
Meanwhile, let us observe that the
precise difference between our definition
and this new one consists
in this only: that whilst the first
presents substance as having <emph>no
actual support</emph>, the second presents
it as having <emph>no need</emph> of actual support,
whether it be supported, at
least supernaturally, or not. This
difference, of course, would amount
to nothing, and might be entirely
overlooked, if things could not
exist but in their natural condition;
for anything which is in no need of
support will naturally exist unsupported.
<pb n='003'/><anchor id='Pg003'/>
But as philosophy is the
handmaid of theology, we must remember
that natural things can be
raised to a supernatural state, and
thus change their mode of existing;
and in such a case the difference
between the two said definitions
may amount to much; because, if a
thing which is naturally in no need
of support be actually supported,
then, according to the first definition,
that thing <emph>thus actually supported</emph>
would cease to exist as a substance,
whilst, according to the
second definition, it would still continue
to exist as a substance, as it
would still have no need of support.
Hence the importance of ascertaining
which of the two definitions we
are authorized to hold according to
the traditional doctrine of philosophers
and theologians.
</p>

<p>
And first, Aristotle, at the head
of the peripatetic school which held
its sway for centuries, defines substance
to be <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ultimum subjectum</foreign>&mdash;<q>the
last subject</q>&mdash;that is, the undermost
subject; by which he unquestionably
means that substance
is something which not only lies
underneath (<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>subjacet</foreign>), but is moreover
the <q>last</q> thing which lies
underneath. In other terms, substance,
according to Aristotle, must
have nothing lying under it, and,
while supporting all its appurtenances,
is itself actually unsupported.
Hence it is, that quantity, for
instance, though lying under some
figure and supporting it, is no substance
at all; for, though it is <emph>a subject,</emph>
it is not the <emph>undermost</emph>.
</p>

<p>
This definition of the Greek philosopher
has been universally accepted
and made use of by Christian
as well as pagan philosophers
of all times, though many of them
called <hi rend='italic'>the first</hi> subject what Aristotle
had called <hi rend='italic'>the last</hi>&mdash;a change
which does not affect the meaning
of the definition, since what is last
in the analytic is first in the synthetic
process. It is clear, therefore,
that both Aristotle and his
followers do not define substance
simply as that which has <emph>no need</emph> of
support, but as that which is <emph>actually
unsupported</emph>.
</p>

<p>
S. John Damascene, in the fourth
chapter of his <hi rend='italic'>Dialectics</hi>, defines
substance to be <q>that which is in
itself in such a manner as not to
exist in anything else</q>;<note place='foot'>Τὸ ἐν ἑατῷ ὃν, καὶ μὴ ἐν ἑτέρῳ ἔχον τὴν ὔωαρξιν.&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Dialect.</hi>,
c. 4.</note> and after
a few lines, <q>Substance,</q> he says,
<q>is that which has its existence in
itself, and not in anything else</q>;<note place='foot'>Ἐπὶ πάντων τῶν ὄντων, τὸ ἐν ἑαυτῷ, καὶ μὴ ἐν
ἑτέρῳ ἔχον τὸ εἶναι, οὐσία ἐστί.&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Dialect.</hi>, c. 4.</note>
and again in another chapter of
the same work, <q>Substance,</q> he
says, <q>is anything which subsists
by itself and has its own being, not
in any other thing, but in itself.</q><note place='foot'>Ὀυσία ἐστι πᾶν ὄτιπερ αὐθυπόστατόν ἐστὶ, καὶ
μὴ ἐν ἑτέρῳ ἔχει τὸ εἶναι.&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Dialect.</hi>, c. 39.</note>
</p>

<p>
According to these definitions,
which are identical, substance is a
thing which not only is able to support
itself, but actually supports itself
to the exclusion of any other
distinct supporter. This is quite
manifest; for, if substance, in the
opinion of this great doctor and
philosopher, had been only a thing
having <emph>no need</emph> of support, how
could he require so pointedly and
explicitly <emph>the actual mode</emph> of existing
in itself and not in anything
else?
</p>

<p>
S. Ambrose admits a notion of
substance quite identical with that
of Aristotle and of all the ancients,
and employs it even in speaking of
God himself. <q>God,</q> says he,
<q>inasmuch as he remains in himself,
and does not subsist by extrinsic
support, is called a substance.</q><note place='foot'><q>Quod in suo maneat, nec ope subsistat aliena
(Deus), appellatur substantia.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>De Incarn.</hi>,
c. 10.</note>
<pb n='004'/><anchor id='Pg004'/>
God, of course, does not fall under
the predicament of substance, as
philosophers know; and yet the
substantiality even of his nature,
according to this holy doctor, implies
the actual absence of extrinsic
sustentation.<note place='foot'>This absence is a real negation&mdash;a negation
of imperfection, so long as we speak of God, who
cannot admit of an inferior nature being inserted
in the plenitude of his reality; but a negation
of further perfection when we speak of
created things, which are potential, and can be
raised supernaturally above their natural condition.</note>
</p>

<p>
S. Thomas, as we might expect,
teaches the very same doctrine.
<q>Substance,</q> says he, <q>is a thing
whose quiddity requires to exist
unsupported by anything else</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>cui
convenit esse non in alio</foreign>;<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Contra Gent.</hi>, lib. 1, c. 25.</note> and he
adds that this formality (<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>esse non
in alio</foreign>) is a mere negation; which
is evident. And in another place,
<q><hi rend='italic'>Substance</hi>,</q> says he, <q>does not differ
from <hi rend='italic'>being</hi> by any difference
which would imply a new nature
superadded to the being itself; but
the name of substance is given to
a thing in order to express its special
mode of existing.</q><note place='foot'><q>Substantia non addit supra ens aliquam differentiam,
quæ significet aliquam naturam superadditam
enti: sed nomine substantiæ exprimitur
specialis modus essendi</q> (<hi rend='italic'>De Verit.</hi>, q. 1, a.
1). Hence this special mode does not constitute
the nature or essence of the thing itself, and for
this reason it is not mentioned in its definition,
as S. Thomas says, <hi rend='italic'>Quodlib.</hi> 9, q. 3.</note> Two
things, then, or two constituents,
are needed, according to S. Thomas,
that we may have a substance:
a physical being and a special
mode of existing. The physical
being is a positive reality, a nature
perfectly constituted, both materially
and formally, whilst the special
mode is a mere negation; but,
though a mere negation, is that
which causes the thing to be a substance,
as <hi rend='italic'>the name of substance is
given to the thing in order to express
its special mode of existing</hi>. Therefore
the thing itself apart from
such a special mode cannot be a
substance, any more than a six-pence
apart from its rotundity can
be a circle.
</p>

<p>
Toletus includes in his definition
of substance both <hi rend='italic'>the thing</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>the
special mode</hi> of existing. He says:
<q>The first substance is a sensible
nature which is not predicated of
any subject nor exists in any subject.</q><note place='foot'><q>Prima substantia est quædam natura sensibilis,
quæ nec de subjecto dicitur, nec in subjecto
aliquo est.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>In Logic. Arist.</hi>, c. 5, <hi rend='italic'>De Substantia</hi>.</note>
</p>

<p>
Suarez says even more explicitly,
<q>It is not necessary for the <emph>essence</emph>
of substance that it should have its
own subsistence, but that it should
have the mode of substance.</q><note place='foot'><q>Non est de essentia eius subsistentia, sed
modus substantiæ.</q>&mdash;In 3 part, q. 77, a. 1.</note>
We cannot, then, overlook, and
much less discard, this special
mode without destroying the <emph>essential</emph>
notion of substance as such.
Now, he who defines substance to
be simply a thing which has <emph>no
need</emph> of support overlooks and discards
this special mode; hence he
destroys the essential notion of
substance as such.
</p>

<p>
Balmes, in his <hi rend='italic'>Fundamental Philosophy</hi>,
says: <q>In the notion of
substance, two other notions are
implied&mdash;to wit, that of permanence
and that of non-inherence. Non-inherence
is the true formal constituent
of substance, and is a
negation; it is grounded, however,
on something positive&mdash;that is, on
the aptitude of the thing to exist in
itself without the need of being
supported by another.</q><note place='foot'>Lib. xi. c. 14.</note> This
passage establishes very clearly the
common doctrine that the aptitude
of a thing to exist without being
supported is not the formal constituent
of substance, but only the
ground on which the proper formal
<pb n='005'/><anchor id='Pg005'/>
constituent of substance (non-inherence)
is conceived to be possible.
</p>

<p>
Ferraris, a modern Italian Thomist,
in his course of philosophy,
says explicitly that substance is
destroyed if its <q>perseity</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>per se
esse</foreign>&mdash;be taken away.<note place='foot'>Vol. 2, q. 1, <hi rend='italic'>de accident</hi>.</note> The word
<q>perseity</q> stands here for the
<q>special mode</q> of S. Thomas, the
<q>mode of substance</q> of Suarez,
the <q>non-inherence</q> of Balmes,
etc.
</p>

<p>
Liberatore has the following:
<q>Going back to the notion of substance,
we may consider three
things which are implied in it: the
first, that it exists, not in any manner
whatever, but in itself; the second,
that it consists of a determinate
reality or essence, from
which its determinate active powers
arise; the third, that it is in
possession of itself&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>sui juris</foreign>&mdash;with
regard to its manner of existing.
Of these three things, the first exhibits
properly and precisely the
notion of substance; the second
presents the concept of nature;
the third expresses the notion of
suppositum.</q><note place='foot'><q>In substantiæ rationem redeuntes, tria
quoad ipsam considerare possumus: primum,
quod existat, et quidem in se; alterum, quod tali
potius quam alia realitate constat, seu essentia,
ex qua determinatæ vires operandi dimanant;
tertium, quod se possideat, sitque sui juris in
existendo. Primum proprie et præcise constituit
notionem substantiæ; alterum conceptum
offert naturæ; postremum denique, ... ideam
suppositi præbet.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Metaph. Gen.</hi>, n. 64.</note>
</p>

<p>
The preceding quotations, to
which others might be added, are
more than sufficient, in our opinion,
to refute the assertion that substance
at all times was considered
simply as a thing having <emph>no need</emph>
of support; for we have seen that
the most prominent philosophers
and theologians of all times uniformly
consider the actual negation
of support as an essential principle
of substance. Sanseverino, a very
learned modern philosopher of the
Thomistic school, treating in his
<hi rend='italic'>Logic</hi> of the predicament of substance,
establishes the fact that, according
to the common teaching
of the scholastics, <q>not the essence
of the thing, but its mode of existing,
formally constitutes the predicament
of substance.</q> Although
that special mode of existing is not
implied in the essential concept of
the thing, <emph>inasmuch as it is a thing</emph>,
yet, according to the doctrine of the
schoolmen, the same special mode
is implied, as a formal constituent,
in the essential concept of the
same thing, <emph>inasmuch as it falls
under the predicament of substance</emph>;
so that, in the constitution of substance,
the essence of the thing is
to be ranked as its material, and
the special mode of existing as its
formal, principle. And the learned
writer sums up all this doctrine in
one general conclusion of Henry of
Ghent, which runs thus: <q>Every
predicament arises out of two constituents,
of which one is the thing
which is to be put under the predicament,
the other is its mode of
being which determines the predicament,
and by these same constituents
are the predicaments distinguished
from one another</q><note place='foot'><q>Ex duobus, nempe ex re prædicamenti, et
ratione essendi ejus, quæ est ratio prædicamenti,
constituitur ipsum prædicamentum, et
diversificatur unum prædicamentum ab alio.</q></note>&mdash;a doctrine explicitly
taught by S. Thomas himself.<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>De Verit.</hi>, q. 1, a. 1.</note>
And here let us reflect that,
if all the schoolmen, as Sanseverino
with the authority of his philosophical
erudition declares, affirm
that the mode of substance, the
non-inherence, the negation of support,
is an <emph>essential</emph> constituent of
substance as such, we are free to
conclude that to affirm the contrary
is to give a false notion of substance;
<pb n='006'/><anchor id='Pg006'/>
while to say that philosophers
have at all times, or at any
time, taught the contrary, is to
give a very false statement of facts.
</p>

<p>
This may suffice to convince the
student that the essential formality
of substance as such is <emph>the negation
of actual support</emph>. And now let us
inquire what is the formal constituent
of suppositum. Suppositum
and substance, though not
identical, are similarly constituted.
The positive entity of both is the
same, and the difference between
them arises entirely from the different
character of their negative
formality, as we are going to explain.
For the essence or nature
of every created being is naturally
accompanied by two negations, of
which neither is essential to it,
while either of them, absolutely
speaking, can be made to disappear.
The first is the negation of anything
<emph>underlying</emph> as a supporter and
acting the part of a subject; and it
is to this negation, as we have
proved, that any complete nature
formally owes its name and rank
of substance. The second is the
negation of anything <emph>overlying</emph>, so
to say, and possessing itself of the
created being in such a manner as
to endue it with an additional complement
and a new subsistence;
and it is to this negation that a
complete nature formally owes its
name and rank of suppositum.
The complete nature, or the thing
in question, when considered apart
from these two negations, does not,
therefore, convey the idea either of
substance or of suppositum, but
exhibits a mere potency of being
either or both; as it is evident that
there cannot be a substance without
the formal constituent of substance,
nor a suppositum without
the formal constituent of suppositum.
</p>

<p>
This doctrine, which is so simple
and clear, and which fully explains
the true meaning of those phrases,
<q>it exists in itself,</q> and <q>it subsists
by itself,</q> can be confirmed by
what S. Thomas teaches on the
subject. And since we have already
said enough in regard to the
mode of substance, we shall give
only what he says concerning subsistence
or suppositality. That the
words <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>per se</foreign>&mdash;<q>by itself</q>&mdash;which
strictly exhibit the formality of the
suppositum, are the expression of
a <emph>mere negation</emph>, is admitted by S.
Thomas in a passage above mentioned.
This would lead us immediately
to conclude that the
formal constituent of suppositum,
in the judgment of the holy doctor,
is a mere negation. But we may
find a more perspicuous proof of
this in those passages where he explains
how the human nature in
Christ subsists without the human
personality. The absence of the
human personality in Christ does
not depend, says he, <q>on the absence
of anything pertaining to the
perfection of the human nature&mdash;but
on the addition of something
that ranks above the human nature,
to wit, on the union of the human
nature with a divine Person.</q><note place='foot'><q>Non propter defectum alicujus quod ad perfectionem
humanæ naturæ pertineat, sed propter
additionem alicujus quod est supra humanam
naturam, quod est unio ad divinam Personam.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Summa
Theol.</hi>, p. 3, q. 4, a. 2.</note>
And again: <q>The divine Person,
by his union, prevented the human
nature from having its own personality.</q><note place='foot'><q>Persona divina sua unione impedivit, ne humana
natura propriam personalitatem haberet.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi></note>
It is manifest from these
two passages that, according to S.
Thomas, the absence of the human
personality in Christ is to be accounted
for by the <emph>addition</emph> of something
above the human nature, and
not by the suppression or subtraction
<pb n='007'/><anchor id='Pg007'/>
of any positive entity belonging
to the human nature. If, then,
the absence of the human personality
entails no absence of positive
reality, it is obvious that the
human personality is not a positive
reality, but a real negation. Such
is S. Thomas's doctrine, endorsed
by Scotus and many others.
</p>

<p>
There are, however, some philosophers
and theologians, Suarez
among others, who consider personality
as something positive; and we
must briefly discuss the grounds of
their opinion.
</p>

<p>
They say that, if the human personality
is nothing positive, human
person will be the same reality as
human nature, and therefore the
one will not be really distinct from
the other; and if so, the one cannot
be assumed without the other. How,
then, can we say that the Eternal
Word assumed the human nature
without the human person?
</p>

<p>
We reply that all negation which
belongs to a real being is a <emph>real</emph>
negation, and constitutes a <emph>real</emph>
mode of being. Accordingly, although
the human personality is
only a negation, the nature existing
under that negation <emph>really</emph> differs
from itself existing without that negation,
no less than a body at rest
really differs from itself in movement,
although rest is only a negation
of movement. And this suffices
to show that the objection is
wholly grounded on the false supposition
that nothing is real which
is not positive.
</p>

<p>
They affirm that subsistence or
suppositality gives the last complement
to the nature, as it terminates
it and makes it subsistent. Hence
subsistence, as they infer, must add
something positive to the nature;
which it cannot do unless it be a
positive reality.
</p>

<p>
We deny the assumption altogether.
Subsistence, in fact, gives
no complement whatever to the nature,
but, on the contrary, presupposes
the complete nature, which,
when simply left to itself, cannot
but be subsistent by itself, and
therefore is said to have its own
subsistence. It is not subsistence
that causes the thing to subsist; it
is the thing which abides by itself
that, in consequence of this same
abiding by itself, has subsistence,
and is called subsistent; just in the
same manner as it is not <emph>rest</emph> that
causes the body to be at rest, but
<emph>the concrete resting</emph>; as rest is evidently
the consequence of the resting.
Hence this second objection,
too, is based on a false assumption.
</p>

<p>
Another of their reasons is the
following: In God, personality is
a positive reality, therefore in creatures
also; for the created person
is a participation of divine person,
which is a positive reality.
</p>

<p>
We do not see how this assertion
can be true. In God there are
three Persons, but neither of them
is participated or communicated to
creatures. Indeed, creatures bear
in themselves a faint imitation of
the three divine Persons, inasmuch
as they involve three intrinsic principles
in their constitution, as we
have explained in the preceding
article; but these three principles
are not three persons. Yet, if divine
personality were in any way
communicable to creatures, creatures
would subsist in three persons;
for how could the personality of
the Father be communicated in any
degree without the personality of
the Son and of the Holy Ghost
being communicated in the same
degree? Personality in God is a
relative entity, and cannot be conceived
without its correlative; and
consequently, if the human personality
<pb n='008'/><anchor id='Pg008'/>
were a participation of divine
personality, it would be impossible
for man to be a single person;
whence it appears that human personality
is not a communication of
divine personality, and is not even
analogous to it. What we call a
human person is nothing but a human
individual nature which is <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>sui
juris</foreign>&mdash;that is, not possessed by a
superior being, but left to itself and
free to dispose of its acts. It therefore
imitates, not the divine Persons,
but the divine absolute Being,
inasmuch as it is independent in
disposing of everything according
to his will. Now, independence,
even in God, implies the negation
or absence of any necessary connection
or conjunction with anything
distinct from the divine nature.
It is but reasonable, then,
to hold that the human nature also
exists free and independent by the
very absence or negation of personal
union with a higher being. We
remark, however, that such a negation
in God is a negation of imperfection,
while in creatures an
analogous negation is a negation of
a higher perfection, since it is the
negation of their union with a more
perfect nature.
</p>

<p>
It has been argued, also, that to
be a person is better than not to be
a person; whence it would follow
that personality is a perfection. On
the other hand, negations are not
perfections; hence personality cannot
be a negation.
</p>

<p>
To this we answer that the proposition,
<q>to be a person is better
than not to be a person,</q> can be
understood in two different manners.
It may mean that to have
a nature which is capable of personality,
and is naturally personal,
is better than to have a nature incapable
of personality; and in this
sense the proposition is true, for it
is certainly better to have the nature
of man than the nature of an
ox. This, however, would not show
that personality is a positive formality.
But the same proposition
might be taken to mean that to
have one's natural personality is
better than to exist without it, in
consequence of hypostatic union
with a higher being; and in this
sense, which is the sense of the objection,
the proposition is evidently
false. For the whole perfection
of the human person is the perfection
of its nature; so that human
personality, instead of being a new
perfection, is only an exponent of
the perfection and dignity of human
nature, which is such that the same
nature can naturally guide itself
and control its actions. We therefore
concede that human personality
is a formality <emph>of a perfect nature</emph>,
but we cannot admit that it is <emph>a
perfection</emph> of itself. If human personality
were a perfection of human
nature, we would be compelled to
say that human nature is less perfect
in Christ than in all other men;
for, though the Eternal Word assumed
the whole human nature,
he did not assume that pretended
perfection, human personality. But
S. Paul assures us that Christ's human
nature <q>is like ours in all
things, except sin.</q> We cannot
therefore suppose that the human
nature is less perfect in him than in
other men; and this leads us to the
conclusion that human personality
is not a positive perfection.
</p>

<p>
Some have pretended that the
mystery of the Incarnation would
become quite inexplicable if the
human person were nothing more
than the human nature left to itself.
Their reason is that by the Incarnation
the human nature is separated
from the human person; which
they deem to be impossible if the
<pb n='009'/><anchor id='Pg009'/>
person is nothing else than the nature
alone.
</p>

<p>
This is, however, a manifest paralogism.
If, in fact, the human
person is the human nature <emph>left to
itself</emph>, the nature assumed by the
Word will certainly not be a human
person, since it is clear that the nature
thus assumed is <emph>not left to itself</emph>.
This suffices to show the inconsistency
of the objection. Let
us add that it is not entirely correct
to say that by the Incarnation
the human nature is separated
from the human person; it would
be more correct to say that the human
nature is prevented from having
that natural subsistence which
would make it a human person.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, it has been said that, if
the human nature which has been
assumed by the Eternal Word was
entirely complete, the union of the
Word with it could not be intimate
and substantial. Hence, according
to this reasoning, there must have
been something wanting in the human
nature assumed, which something
has been supplied by the hypostatic
union.
</p>

<p>
We cannot but repeat, with S.
Thomas, that the human nature assumed
by the Word is absolutely
perfect, and therefore exempt from
any deficiency which could have
been supplied by the hypostatic
union. And as for the reason alleged,
we say that it is grounded
on a false supposition. The union
of the Word with the human nature
is not a conspiration of the
divine and the human into oneness
of <emph>substance</emph>, for the thing would
be impossible; and therefore it is
not wholly correct to say that the
union is <emph>substantial</emph>. The proper
term is <hi rend='italic'>hypostatic</hi>&mdash;that is, <hi rend='italic'>personal</hi>;
for, in fact, the human nature conspires
with the divine Word into
oneness of <hi rend='italic'>person</hi>, the two natures
or substances remaining entirely
distinct. Now, the oneness of person
is not obtained by supplying
any deficiency in the human nature,
but by <emph>adding</emph>, as S. Thomas
teaches, to the perfect human nature
that which is above it&mdash;that is,
by the Word taking possession of
it in his own person.
</p>

<p>
Such are the principal reasons
advanced by those who consider
human personality, and suppositality
in general, as a positive mode.
We think we have answered them
sufficiently.
</p>

<p>
We cannot better conclude this
controversy than by inviting the
same philosophers to take cognizance
of the following argument.
The mode of suppositum, as well as
the mode of substance, is not an
accidental but a <emph>substantial</emph> mode,
as all agree, and every one must
admit. Now, no substantial mode
can be positive; and therefore
neither the mode of suppositum
nor the mode of substance can be
positive. The minor of this syllogism
can be proved thus: Positive
modes are nothing but positive actualities
or affections of being; and
unless they are mere relative denominations
(which is not the case
with substantial modes), they must
result from the positive reception
of some act in a real subject. This
is an obvious truth, for nothing is
actual but by some act; and all
acts which are not essential to the
first constitution of the being are
received in the being already constituted
as in a real subject. And
since all acts thus received are accidental,
hence all the positive
modes intrinsic to the being must
be accidental modes; and no substantial
mode can be positive.
Therefore whatever is positive in
the suppositum and in the substance
belongs to the <emph>nature</emph> of the being
<pb n='010'/><anchor id='Pg010'/>
which has the mode of suppositum
or of substance, whilst the <emph>modes</emph>
themselves are mere negations.
</p>

<p>
This truth, however, should not
be misunderstood. When we say
that <q>to be in itself</q> or <q>to be by
itself</q> is a mere negation, we do not
refer to the verb <q>to be</q>; we only
refer to the appendage <q>in itself</q>
or <q>by itself.</q> <hi rend='italic'>To be</hi> is positive, but
belongs to the nature as such, as it is
the essential complement of all being,
whether substance and suppositum
or not. The negation consists,
in the one case, in <emph>not being
sustained</emph> by an underlying supporter,
and, in the other, in <emph>not being
taken possession of</emph> by an overlying
superior being. Indeed, when we
unite the verb <hi rend='italic'>to be</hi> with either of
the two negations, we unite the
positive with the negative. But
the positive comes in as determinable,
while the negative comes in as
determinant. Hence the resultant
determination or formality is only
the actuality of a negation. Now,
the actuality of a negation, though
it is real inasmuch as it is the affection
of a positive being, yet it is
<emph>negative</emph>; for all actuality is denominated
by its formal principle,
and such a principle, in our case, is
a negation.
</p>

<p>
A writer in a Catholic periodical
has ventured to say that if the formality
of substance (and the same
would also apply to the suppositum)
is negative, then substance <q>will
consist merely in a negation.</q> It
is surprising that a philosopher has
not seen the absurdity of such a
conclusion. Substance is not to
be confounded with its formality.
There are many positive things
which involve a negation. In an
empty pocket, emptiness is a negation;
ignorance in the ignorant
is a negation; and limit in all
things finite is a negation. Yet no
one will say that an empty pocket,
an ignorant pupil, or a finite being
<q>consist merely in a negation</q>;
and therefore, although the formality
of substance is a negation, it
does not follow that substance is a
mere negation.
</p>

<p>
It now remains for us to show
that neither of the two aforesaid
negations is essential to any created
being, and that a created being
can therefore, absolutely speaking,
exist, at least supernaturally, without
either of them. Our first
proof is drawn from the fact that
neither the one nor the other negation
is reckoned among the essential
constituents of created beings.
All complete nature, by common
admission, consists <q>of essence and
existence</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ex essentia et esse</foreign>&mdash;the
existence being the formal complement
of the essence, and the essence
itself involving, as its principles, an
act with its corresponding term, as
the readers of our last article already
know. Accordingly, there
is nothing essential in a complete
being besides its act, its term, and
its complement; and therefore
neither the mode of substance nor
the mode of suppositum is essential
to a complete created being.
</p>

<p>
Our second proof is drawn from
the notion of existence. <q>To exist
strictly and simply,</q> says Suarez,
<q>means only to have a formal entity
in the order of nature; and
therefore things existing are equally
susceptible of the mode of being
which consists in leaning on a supporter,
and of the opposite mode
which excludes all support.</q><note place='foot'><q>Existere ex se solum dicit habere entitatem
extra causas, seu in rerum natura; unde de se
indifferens est ad modum existendi innitendo
alteri ut sustentanti, et ad modum existendi per
se sine aliquo sustentante.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Metaph. Disp.</hi> 33,
sect. 4, n. 24.</note> This
is a tangible truth; for although
a complete being possesses in its
<pb n='011'/><anchor id='Pg011'/>
own constitution what is required
for its own existence, yet it has
nothing in its constitution which
implies the necessity of existing in
itself and by itself. It can indeed,
and will naturally, be in itself without
anything underlying as a supporter,
since it sufficiently supports
itself on its own term; but it contains
nothing that would make impossible
the sub-introduction of a
supernatural supporter. And, again,
a complete being can subsist by
itself without further completion,
since it is sufficiently complete by
its formal complement; but it contains
nothing which would exclude
the possibility of its acquiring a
further completion and a supernatural
subsistence.
</p>

<p>
A third proof might be drawn
from the fact that our own bodies
exist indeed in themselves, but do
not subsist by themselves, as their
material nature is taken possession
of by a spiritual being&mdash;the soul&mdash;and
subsists by its subsistence.
From this fact, which is alluded
to in S. Athanasius' <hi rend='italic'>Symbol</hi> as an
image of the assumption of the human
nature by the Word, we might
show that suppositality can, even
naturally, be supplanted by the
union of a lower with a higher nature.
But we will not develop this
proof, as it requires too long an explanation
and many new considerations,
which cannot be embodied
in the present article.
</p>

<p>
Last, but not least, it is evident
that all negations which are not
included in the essence of a thing
can be supplanted by the position
of their contrary. Hence the mode
of substance and the mode of suppositum,
which are negations, and
are not included in the essence of
created things, can be supplanted
by the intervention of a supernatural
power.
</p>

<p>
As we must here keep within the
bounds of philosophy, we abstain
from discussing other cognate questions
which can be safely answered
only by a direct appeal to dogmatic
definitions and theological arguments.
We may, however, state
that the old scholastic theologians
and the fathers of the church, both
Greek and Latin, admitted that the
mode of substance, as well as the
mode of suppositum, can be made
to disappear from the thing to which
it naturally belongs in the manner
above explained. For their common
doctrine on the mysteries of
the Incarnation and of the Holy
Eucharist is, that the two mysteries
are analogous to one another,<note place='foot'>It is known that this analogy has been erroneously
interpreted by some old and modern
heretics, who taught that Christ's body is in the
Holy Eucharist by <hi rend='italic'>impanation</hi> or by <hi rend='italic'>consubstantiation</hi>,
and not by transubstantiation. The
heresy of impanation asserts that the Eternal
Word in the Holy Eucharist <hi rend='italic'>becomes bread by
assuming hypostatically the substance of bread</hi>.
The heresy of consubstantiation assumes that in
the Holy Eucharist the substance of Christ's body
is <hi rend='italic'>united with the substance of the bread</hi>, and that
therefore the Eucharist contains both substances.
These heresies are, of course, mere corruptions
of the traditional doctrine. The first corrupts
it by confounding the substantive sustentation
with the personal assumption, and by substituting
the latter in the place of the former.
The second corrupts it by supposing that a thing
substantively supported by an underlying substance
continues to exist as a substance; which
is against the traditional definition of substance,
and against the very analogy of which it pretends
to be the interpretation; for, in virtue of
such an analogy, it is as impossible for a thing
<emph>thus supported</emph> to be a substance as it is impossible
for the human nature <emph>assumed</emph> to be a human
person. Hence what logically follows from the
analogy of the two mysteries is neither impanation
nor consubstantiation, but real and proper
transubstantiation&mdash;that is, a real substitution of
one substance for another under the remaining
sensible species.</note> and
admit of a parallel mode of reasoning
for their explanation. The
analogy more or less explicitly
pointed out by them involves the
admission of a principle which may
be expressed in the following words:
<q>As the whole human nature can
exist in Christ <emph>without the mode of
human person</emph>, which is excluded
<pb n='012'/><anchor id='Pg012'/>
by the hypostatic union of the
Word with it, so can the whole
sensible nature (<hi rend='italic'>species</hi>) of bread
exist in the Holy Eucharist <emph>without
its mode of substance</emph>, which is excluded
by the substantive presence
of Christ's body under it.</q> This
traditional doctrine has been almost
ignored in these latter centuries
by those who were anxious to
explain everything according to a
special system of natural philosophy,
and who little by little formed
a new theory of the sacramental
species; but the physical system
on which these theologians took
their stand having given way, and
their new theory having lost its
plausibility, we are of opinion that
instead of seeking for new explanations,
as some do, it is more prudent
to fall back on tradition, and
take into consideration the authorized
teachings of our old polemic
writers, of those especially who so
valiantly fought against Berengarius
and other heretics in behalf of
the Eucharistic dogma.
</p>

<p>
Before we conclude, we wish to
make a few remarks on some ambiguous
expressions which may be
a source of error in speaking of
substance and of suppositum. We
have said that Aristotle includes in
his first category the suppositum
as well as the substance, and that
for this reason the words, <q>by itself,</q>
<q>to support,</q> <q>to subsist,</q>
have been promiscuously applied to
the substance as well as to the suppositum.
This has been done not
only in philosophy, but even in
theology. Thus we read in good
authors that the divine Person of
the Word <q>supports</q> or <q>sustains</q>
Christ's human nature.
Yet these words, as also <q>sustentation,</q>
when applied to subsistence,
must have a meaning which they
have not when applied to substance;
and it is plain that to employ
the same words in both cases
may give rise to serious mistakes.
Some authors, besides overlooking
the distinction to be made between
<q>existing in itself</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>esse in se</foreign>&mdash;and
<q>subsisting by itself</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>per se subsistere</foreign>&mdash;confound
also with one another
their opposites&mdash;viz., <q>to exist
in something else</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>esse in alio</foreign>&mdash;and
<q>to subsist by something else</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>per
aliud subsistere</foreign>. Suarez, for
instance, though usually very accurate
in his expressions, says that
<q>the mode of existing by itself and
without dependence on any supporter
has for its opposite to exist
in something else;</q><note place='foot'><q>Subsistere dicit determinatum modum existendi
per se et sine dependentia a sustentante;
unde illi opponitur inesse vel inexistere; dicitque
determinatum modum existendi in alio.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Disp.
Metaph.</hi> 33, sect. 4, n. 24.</note> which is not
correct, for the divinity of Christ
exists in his humanity, and nevertheless
does not depend on it as a
supporter. It would be more correct
to say that the mode of subsisting
by itself has for its opposite
to subsist by something else. And
it is evident that to subsist <emph>by</emph>
something else is not the same as
to exist <emph>in</emph> it.
</p>

<p>
To get rid of all such ambiguous
phrases, we observe that the word
<q>sustentation,</q> as compared with
any created nature, can have three
different meanings, according as
we apply it to the act, the term, or
the complement of the created being.
</p>

<p>
When sustentation is considered
in connection with the act or the
formal principle of a being, it
means positive <hi rend='italic'>conservation</hi>; for all
contingent being comes out of nothing
by the positive production of
an act, and needs to be kept out of
nothing by the positive conservation
of the same act, as we know
from special metaphysics.
</p>

<pb n='013'/><anchor id='Pg013'/>

<p>
When sustentation is considered
in connection with the intrinsic
term of a being, it means <hi rend='italic'>underlying</hi>;
and in this sense we say that
substance sustains its accidents.
This meaning of the word <q>sustentation</q>
is most conformable to its
etymology; and thus, if anything is
lying under any reality in that
manner in which substance lies
under its accidents, we shall say
very properly that it <emph>sustains</emph> that
reality. In this sense, sustentation
and support may be taken as synonymous.
</p>

<p>
When sustentation is considered
in connection with the formal complement
of a being, it means <hi rend='italic'>overlying</hi>
in such a manner as to superinduce
a new complement and a new
subsistence. Such is the manner
in which the Person of the Word
sustains Christ's humanity. This
kind of sustentation implies hypostatic
union and super-completion.
</p>

<p>
We might, therefore, divide sustentation
into <hi rend='italic'>conservative</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>substantive</hi>,
and <hi rend='italic'>hypostatic</hi>. The first is
usually called <hi rend='italic'>conservation</hi>; the
second might keep the name of
<hi rend='italic'>sustentation</hi>; whilst the third might
perhaps be fitly styled <hi rend='italic'>personalization</hi>,
as this word seems adequately
to express the nature of personal
sustentation.
</p>

<p>
As to the phrases, <q>to be in itself</q>
and <q>to be by itself,</q> we
have seen that their distinction is
most important. It may be useful
to add that, even in God, to be in
himself and to be by himself are
to be distinguished by a distinction
of reason indeed, but which is
grounded on a real foundation.
God is essentially <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>a se</foreign>, <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>in se</foreign>, and
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>per se</foreign>&mdash;that is, of himself, in himself,
and by himself. These three attributes
are absolute, and belong to
the divine nature as an absolute
reality; but as in this absolute
reality there are intrinsic relations
of personalities, we may reflect that,
in this relative order, <hi rend='italic'>to be of himself</hi>
can be considered as owing
especially to God the Father, who
does not proceed from any other
person, but is himself the first principle
of their procession; <hi rend='italic'>to be in
himself</hi> can be considered as having
a special reference to God the
Son, in whom the whole entity of
the Father is found as in the substantial
term of his eternal generation;
and, lastly, <hi rend='italic'>to be by himself</hi> can
be explained by reference to the
Holy Ghost, who is the essential
complement of the Blessed Trinity,
as that is said to be by itself which
is ultimately complete in its own
entity.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, God, as existing essentially
of himself&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>a se</foreign>&mdash;has no
need or capability of conservation;
as existing essentially in himself&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>in
se</foreign>&mdash;he has no need or capability of
sustentation; and as existing essentially
by himself&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>per se</foreign>&mdash;he has no
need or capability of super-completion.
But with contingent beings
the case is quite different. And
first, contingent beings are not <q>of
themselves,</q> as they are from God;
and for this reason they have an
essential need of conservation, as
we have stated, so far as their essential
act is concerned. Secondly,
although they naturally exist
<q>in themselves,</q> yet this their
mode of existing is not the result
of an essential necessity, but only
of a natural ordination, which God
can supersede. They exist in
themselves when the term of their
own essence is their <emph>undermost</emph> support;
for then the whole essence
supports itself in a natural manner,
and is a natural substance. Thirdly,
although created beings naturally
<q>subsist by themselves,</q> yet this
manner of existing is not the consequence
<pb n='014'/><anchor id='Pg014'/>
of an essential necessity,
but only of a natural ordination,
which can be superseded by the
Creator. They subsist by themselves
when the formal complement
of their essence is their <emph>ultimate</emph>
complement; for then the
whole being is left to itself as a natural
suppositum.
</p>

<p>
These explanations will be of
some assistance, we hope, to the
philosophical student in forming
a correct judgment as to the formal
constituents of substance and suppositum,
and as to the manner of
speaking about them with proper
discrimination. We wish we had
handled the subject in a better
style and a less monotonous phraseology;
but it was our duty to
aim at preciseness rather than ornament.
If there is any part of
philosophy in which precision is
more necessary than in another, it
is that which treats of the principles
of things; and if we succeed
in presenting such principles in
their true light, we shall deem it a
sufficient apology for the dryness
of our philosophical style.

<head>On The Wing: A Southern Flight.</head>

<p>
What induced us to pick our
way on foot from the railway carriage
to the Hôtel du Parc et Bordeaux,
near eleven o'clock at night,
on our arrival at Lyons, I cannot
possibly conceive.
</p>

<p>
It was the 3d of January that
we performed this unnecessary
penance; and the only explanation
I can give is that we were all
rather dazed by the long journey
from Paris, and had forgotten that
of course there was waiting at the
station an omnibus to carry on the
passengers. We had been silent
and sleepy for some hours, when
the bright lights twinkling up and
down the heights of the city of
Lyons, and across the bridges, and,
corruscating at the station, had
roused us all up, and made us exclaim
at the fairy sight. I had
seen it again and again; but I always
look out eagerly for the first
peep at that tossed-about town
after night has closed in, and I
know none more brilliant and picturesque.
I thought we all looked
rather rueful as we entered the
hotel, and that it suddenly struck
us we had come on foot, and
might therefore look too economically
inclined to suit the views of
the buxom lady who advanced to
meet us. I saw her cast rather a
doubtful eye to the rear; but her
face brightened when she found we
had at least been able to afford a
porter to carry such luggage as we
might want for one night. We had
no valid reason to give in reply to
her anxious enquiries as to why we
had not availed ourselves of the
hotel omnibus; which very soon
afterwards came rattling into the
yard, quite empty, the guard and
coachman viewing us indignantly.
Madame, finding we had nothing to
say for ourselves, compassionately
furnished each with a candle, and allowed
us to gather together our scattered
wits in sleep.
</p>

<p>
The <q>we</q> consisted of brother
Frank, sister Mary, and I; also
of Ann, our maid. I suppose
I must describe the party. I
wish I could draw them instead.
Frank is dressed all over in a gray
tweed. I sometimes tell him he
looks like a gray parrot; but that is
absurd, because he is so extremely
taciturn, which gray parrots are not.
He makes a capital courier. He
always knows what we poor women
shall want, and how much we can
do, which is a great comfort to me;
because, as Mary is delicate, and
we are travelling on her account, I
should be so worried if Frank insisted
on doing fourteen hours of
railroad per diem. He is such a
good fellow that he would never
wish us to overtask ourselves. But
then he is so strong that I know it
must seem very extraordinary to
him that we should be such poor
creatures, and get tired out so soon.
I sometimes wonder what has made
Frank so tender and gentle, and
so considerate. Perhaps it is the
being so much with Mary. She
makes everybody gentle who comes
<pb n='016'/><anchor id='Pg016'/>
near her. Somehow she seems to
stroke everybody's fur the right way,
no matter how ruffled they were
before. Poor Mary! she has for
many years been a widow, after a
brief and unhappy married life, and
having lost both her children, a girl
and a boy. She is the eldest of us
three, but has a marvellous knack
of looking the youngest and the
brightest. She has been very beautiful,
and is so still in many ways.
Now I come! But how shall I describe
myself? The more I think
of it, the more impossible I find it.
As I am the relater of our adventures,
I suppose my readers will form
for themselves some idea of what I
am like. So I will only say that
my name is Jane, and that I am
an old maid, but that I do not
feel old. As to my looks, I really
do not know what to say. I am
not <emph>always</emph> altogether dissatisfied
with them; but then, on the other
hand, when I am inclined to judge
them leniently, the unlucky feeling
comes over me that it is solely
owing to my hat, or the way my hair
is done, or some fortuitous circumstance
upon which I cannot reckon
as a permanency, and which may be
gone before any one else has had the
time to observe it. So that though I
have my lucky moments, I have little
or no capital to go on. Now, Mary,
with her large, soft eyes, her exquisite
mouth, and beautiful teeth, attracts
strangers wherever she goes; although
she is always insisting upon it
she is quite an old woman. And now
comes Ann. She is about my age,
but does not at all consider herself
an old maid, and therefore always
contradicts me when I speak of
myself in such disparaging terms.
I generally say something in reply
about the observation being six for
me and half a dozen for herself.
But this she does not like. Ann is
a very good girl, and a capital
maid. She has pretty, fuzzy black
hair, and bright though small black
eyes; she has a very white skin, and
a neat figure. But she does not
like travelling, and is especially
disgusted when the scenery is very
bold and magnificent. Mountains
are her abhorrence, distant views
her antipathy. This is far from
being our first journey; and
whenever we have found ourselves
in the railway carriage from Dover
to London Bridge, Ann invariably
remarks how lovely the country is
as we dash through the flat green
fields and monotonous cherry gardens
of simple Kent. And her admiration
culminates when we pass
any gentlemen's seats. The absence
of striking features, the unbroken,
unaccidental horizon, the
universal green, and the level lines,
give Ann a sensation of peace and
repose; while I, who have something
of an artist's soul, am feeling
how very difficult it would be to
get an effective subject or a <q>nice
bit of color</q> out of the platitudes
of dear England's quiet homesteads.
</p>

<p>
We were off the next day by daylight,
I feeling like a swallow flying
south; and very soon we perceived
in the clear air a warmer glow than
any to be had the other side of
Lyons. Even the desert region of
La Crau seemed full of charms to
me. The dim, gray expanse of
thick-lying stones that Hercules
persuaded by his prayers the angry
Jove to shower down on the Ligurians,
broken only by thin tufts of
mint and scant rosemary, themselves
also of a gray green, and
leading on over thousands of acres
to the blue distant hills that were
blushing into rosy hues when we
crossed the desert, were not without
delightful <q>points,</q> which I could
<pb n='017'/><anchor id='Pg017'/>
have transferred to my sketch-book
had time allowed me. <q>La Belle
Provence</q> is a very <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>journalière</foreign>
beauty, and requires a bright sun to
clothe her in sparkling jewels, and
to dye her dress in blue and violet
and rose-madder, to be worthy of
the name that centuries have agreed
to give her. When there are no
lights, there is apt to be an air of
desolation and barrenness. Those
hills, arrayed in many tints, give
back the lights from rocky and
unproductive cliffs; but down in
the valleys, with the exception of
La Crau, the culture is rich and
varied. The first stunted olive-trees
as we approached Marseilles
were welcome less on their own account&mdash;for
they are miserable specimens&mdash;than
for the association of
ideas connected with their pallid
leaves, and because they gave promise
of the large ones that would
gladden our eyes further on.
</p>

<p>
The station of Hyères is a few
miles from the town. We had ordered
a carriage to meet us; and all the
way Mary was looking out for the
large umbrella pine that she remembered
so well years ago, when
there was no railway so far south.
It had been the great landmark on
the road from Hyères to Toulon.
We measured our rides and walks
in that direction by the great pine.
There it stood, the same as ever,
and brought back all Hyères and
the two winters spent there, besides
other shorter visits, to our memory
with one rush. All else was changed.
New houses had sprung up
on all sides. Mme. Susanne's old
tumble-down hotel, where Mary
had stopped for a few days on her
wedding-tour, is changed into a
magnificent building with caryatides
supporting the façade like a
Genoese palace; and the palms
on La Place des Palmiers, which I
had known in their babyhood, have
grown to a size that would not disgrace
Arabia. The hotel we went
to stands in what used to be Le Jardin
Frassinet. It had been full of
orange-trees when we first knew it,
as had all the other gardens in the
place. But one very severe winter
having greatly injured the trees, the
inhabitants have given up the cultivation
of oranges, and have planted
peach-trees instead, much to
the detriment of the beauty of
Hyères. I found Mary, the day
after our arrival, gazing wistfully at
a group of tall cypress and one
palm-tree that had marked the
boundary of the gardens belonging
to the house where she lived with
her children the second time she
came here. We missed her soon
afterwards, and refrained from following
her, for we knew she wanted
to visit alone the scenes of some
joys and many sorrows long ago
passed away&mdash;so far as anything is
really past which is worthy the
name of joy or sorrow. She came
back with her hands full of the little,
dark, mottled arum and its lance-head
leaves that grow so profusely
on the hills and by the roadside.
They are of a dingy-purple hue,
shaded off into white; and we exclaimed
against them as she put
them in a glass, alleging that they
had an unpleasant odor. <q>I know
they have,</q> she answered; <q>but
their quaint, twisted shape, and
blossoms like the head of a snake,
are so full of memories that I rather
like the smell than otherwise.</q>
After that we let her enjoy her
arums alone, for we knew how much
that meant. Doubtless she had
been wandering about, recalling
visions of the past: the dead&mdash;the
lost, but not dead, that worse separation!&mdash;and
all the tangled maze
of the years that are gone. Mary's
<pb n='018'/><anchor id='Pg018'/>
bouquet of arums was redeemed by
a handful of the sweet white alyssum;
and these two flowers, with
a few of the bold-faced, unflinching
daisies of Provence, so unlike our
modest northern flowers, were all
the wild blossoms we could hope to
find in January.
</p>

<p>
We could not leave Hyères without
performing a pilgrimage to
Notre Dame de Consolation, the
old church on a hill overlooking
the coast. The ascent is marked
by the Way of the Cross rudely
painted in small niches of masonry
by the side of the road. When we
were last here, there was a daily
Mass said by a hermit-priest. He
had some years previously tried his
vocation at the Carmelites', and
had not succeeded. But the impulse
to seek utter solitude was too
strong to be resisted; and for a
long time he had lived in the surrounding
mountains, a veritable
hermit, subsisting upon the poorest
fare, which was brought to him at
regular intervals by the peasants.
Whether he had erected a hut for
himself, or lived in a cave, I never
learnt; but when the bishop of
the diocese became aware of the
fact, he thought it to be regretted
that a priest should not celebrate
Mass, and proposed to him that he
should live in one of the small
rooms of the deserted convent
which is attached to the Church of
Our Lady of Consolation, take care
of the church, and say Mass. This
offer he gladly accepted; and there
he resided for some time. We used
to go sometimes, on a bright spring
morning, to attend his Mass. Our
breakfast was packed in a basket,
and hung to the pommel of my donkey's
saddle, to be eaten afterwards
on the top of the low, semi-circular
wall which encloses a piece of
ground in front of the church.
I always looked with a special interest,
not altogether unmingled with
curiosity, at the slight, bent figure
of the priest, who could not be more
than forty years of age, as he emerged
from the door of the sacristy,
and, with eyes so cast down that
they seemed closed, passed by us
to the altar. Who shall say what
had called up that deep thirst for
utter solitude and silence which
had driven him to so extreme a
life? Was it some calamity, or
some crime, or only&mdash;as is far more
probable&mdash;that strange instinct
which is implanted in the nature of
some men to flee their kind, and be
alone with themselves&mdash;an instinct
which possibly many have felt
stirring within them at odd moments,
but which, when touched
by divine grace, grows into a wonderful
and exceptional vocation;
once more common, in the early
days of Christianity, when the
whole world lay in pagan luxury
and gilded vice, and which even
our subduing, taming, commonplace
civilization fails in some rare
cases to smother in the soul?
</p>

<p>
What became of the hermit of
Our Lady of Consolation I could
never learn. Perhaps the solitude
seemed incomplete when ladies
could attend his Mass, and picnic
afterwards on his premises. At any
rate, he has been gone for many
years; and Mass is only said on
certain feasts, when the peasantry
come in crowds, and bring flowers
and offerings to the Madonna, as
represented by a peculiarly ugly
and dark-colored wooden statue,
which has grown to be very precious
to those who have obtained
special favors in answer to their
prayers offered here. Many years
ago, Mary, in her Protestant days,
had brought a lace veil, the gift of
a Russian prince, who was leaving
<pb n='019'/><anchor id='Pg019'/>
Hyères with a sick wife, and who
wanted prayers for their safe journey;
thereby producing a curious
admixture of heretical, schismatical,
and Catholic feeling which
no doubt had each their separate
value and acceptance before God,
being all offered in simplicity and
good faith; for it was with no unwilling
hands that, mounted on one
of the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>prie-dieux</foreign> in the church, she
had arranged the veil over the
statue, and then knelt to say a
prayer for the prince's intention.
</p>

<p>
The church is full of votive offerings.
The walls are entirely covered
from roof to floor. As many
of them have been put up by sailors,
they more or less have reference
to the dangers of the deep. There
is a model of a ship hanging up
near the entrance, probably because
its larger copy was saved from
wreck. The pictures representing
recovery from sickness or preservation
from peril are often extremely
grotesque, and might provoke a
smile were it not that they carry
one's thoughts direct to the faith
and gratitude they represent.
</p>

<p>
I had often wandered through
the deserted rooms and cells of the
old convent. There is no glass
left in some of the windows; but
the weather is kept out by the external
wooden shutters which are
universal in the south. There is a
lovely view from all sides. In front,
the sea, with Les Isles d'Or (the
Golden Islands) hemming it in as if
it were a large lake, save to the
left, where it opens out into the wide
ocean. These islands form some
of those originally called Les Larins,
which name included the group before
the coast of Cannes. And in
most of them the first religious
houses for men were established by
S. Honorius, though only one island,
that on which he and all his monks
were martyred by the Saracens,
bears his name. Les Isles d'Or, or
Les Isles d'Hyères, as they are also
called, are now but sparsely inhabited.
Years ago, <q>when we were
young,</q> we had landed on one of
these islands, where stands a fort,
and a few soldiers are stationed.
There are also a half-dozen of
cottages, inhabited by fishermen and
shepherds. We were a joyous
band, and had sailed from the
mainland in the admiral's cutter,
the French fleet riding at anchor
off our coast. As we scrambled up
the sandy beach, and pushed our
way through the tangled undergrowth
of myrtle, heath, cytisus, and
leutisca, we found ourselves face to
face with the solitary sentinel pacing
in front of the blind walls of
the low but solid-looking fort.
His face broke into smiles, and,
with a saucy gleam in his dark eyes,
he said to the foremost gentlemen
of our party, <q>Comment, Messieurs!
vous nous en menez toutes ces
belles dames? Mais vous allez
révolutionner notre pauvre curé.</q><note place='foot'>What, sir! you bring us all those pretty
ladies! You will revolutionize our poor curate.</note>
We could find no remains of monastic
houses on the islands; but
there are traces of walls close to the
sea, on the mainland, which are
said to be the remains of a convent
of nuns who met with a severe punishment
for an ill-timed jest. Possibly
they were not all that as nuns
they might have been. At any rate,
they seem to have found their life
occasionally dull; and when the
longing for a little excitement
became irrepressible, the abbess
would toll the great bell of the convent,
which by rights was never
used save to ring the Hours and the
Angelus, or to summon the neighbors
for aid when any of the frequent
panics about the landing of
<pb n='020'/><anchor id='Pg020'/>
the marauding Saracens threatened
the safety of the Sisters. The
jest had been played too often,
and when at length the oft-expected
Saracens really came, the
poor nuns rang their bell in vain.
No one appeared to the rescue,
and the Saracens had it all their
own way, and the convent was destroyed.
</p>

<p>
The sea must have encroached
since those days, for the waters
wash over the scanty ruins, and I
have picked my way along the
foundations with little salt lakes
lying between. Far to the left lie
<hi rend='italic'>Les Salines</hi>, where they evaporize
the sea-water in shallow square
spaces, and thus obtain a coarse
gray salt. They say that sometimes
flamingoes may be shot among this
marshy land; but I could never obtain
one, though I know it abounds
in wild fowl of every description.
The deep orange-colored boughs
of the large willow-trees give a
peculiar charm to the distant landscape
in the winter when the leaves
are off; and close upon the edge
of the shore is a fine wood of umbrella
pines, whereof three giants,
standing apart from the rest, had
been great favorites of ours. We
had looked out eagerly on our arrival
for our three pines. Alas! one
was missing. Years ago these three
solitary, magnificent trees had had
a strange fascination for me. I
wanted to find my way to where
they stood; but it was beyond the
marshes, and near the <hi rend='italic'>salines</hi>.
There was no direct road, and no
one could tell me how to get there;
not even the young French naval
officers, who used to come often
and spend the evening with us, and
who must have landed not so very
far from where they stood. The
craving to see my three pines face to
face grew, however, too strong to be
resisted; and so one day I set off
on donkey-back, taking Ann with
me, and resolved that I would not
return till I had accomplished my
end. Great were our difficulties.
We had to thread our way along
narrow raised paths through the
marshes, just wide enough for our
donkeys to tread; and as, of
course, we dared not leave these
paths, which did not wind, but turned
at right angles, we as often
seemed to be going away from the
pines as the reverse. At one moment
we were pursued by a couple
of savage dogs, who tore after us
from the open yard of a farm-house,
and who were so very angry at our
intrusion that escape along our
narrow way, and with our leisurely
steeds, seemed questionable. At
length I found myself at the base
of a high sand-bank, on which the
yellow sea-thistle, with its glaucous
leaves, found a scanty subsistence
and a doubtful root-hold.
This I had to scramble up, while
for every ten inches I made in advance
I slid back six. At last I
was at my long-desired goal, and
my three giants were really magnificent
to behold. It was on my fourth
visit to Hyères, with intervals of
years between, that I accomplished
this feat, and I had always looked
at my pines the first thing in the
morning, when the strip of sea between
the mainland and the isles
was still lying gray in the early
light. Then, again, I watched for
the red glow of the setting sun on
their smooth stems, painted, as it
were, in burnt sienna. Again, on
moonlit nights I had looked for
their broad, deep black crests, falling
like an ink-spot on the silver
sea. And now at last, when they
had almost become to me like some
mystery, meaning more than met
the eye, I could throw my arms
<pb n='021'/><anchor id='Pg021'/>
about them, and lay my hot cheek
on their noble trunks.
</p>

<p>
It was not till then I knew how
tired I was. I could not delay long
with my old friends. I do not remember
anything about the getting
home, save that the dogs who had
so guarded my garden of the Hesperides,
and stood between me and
the fulfilment of my desire, now
that I had accomplished the feat,
let me return in silence. I was
very weary; but I was thoroughly
contented and satisfied. And now
one of my old friends was laid low!
How he came to his end I know
not. But I felt that he had died,
not that he had been cut down;
and for a moment a strange, weird
melancholy stole over me at finding
I had outlived a noble tree. It
seemed as if I must be very old to
have done that, and that it was
hardly natural. I remember I asked
myself then, at the very time of
my <hi rend='italic'>culte</hi> of the pine-trees, and I
have repeated the question since,
whether there was not in my feelings
something of that dim instinct
which binds man in an obscure
affinity with all nature, down to its
lower strata and its primeval developments.
As man contains
something of all in his own being,
so must he have a sympathy with
all; for, as has been wisely said,
man is a universe in himself, with
another universe to wait on him.
Most people have a special attraction
to some race of animals. Some
have a love for, and a power over,
the horse and the dog greater than
others; and this not always nor
only as the results of habit, but
as a natural gift. Certain flowers
have a peculiar attraction for many
people, in preference to others
equal in beauty and perfume. All
these preferences may point to hidden
laws of affinity, of which we
know very little more than the bare
fact that all in creation finds its
portion in each man, and that in
his own single self he is chemical,
vegetable, animal, and spiritual. I
am afraid to say any more, lest my
readers should think I believe we
are in general descended from
the little open-mouthed sea-squirts
called ascidians, but that I claim
for myself in particular some higher
origin in the shape of a conifer
great-grandfather. I assure them
it is nothing of the kind. With regard
to my sympathy with animals,
of course, being an old maid, I
ought to prefer cats and gray parrots.
On the contrary, I prefer
dogs, and Frank is the only gray
parrot I ever thought of loving.

<p>
Before leaving Hyères, I made a
sketch from the top of the hill
(which in my younger days, for
want of knowing better, I used to
call the mountain) on which stand
the picturesque ruins of the old
château which formerly belonged
to the French branch of the huge
family of Fox; who, varying their
name, if not their nature, according
to the sky under which they flourished,
had taken root in England,
France, and Germany in the old
feudal times. They possessed certainly
a magnificent abode at Hyères,
and probably kept all the
neighborhood in awe. It is a glorious
situation. It overlooks a long
stretch of the road to Toulon as
that winds through the fertile, well-cultivated
valley; and to the right
rises the rocky summit of Le Coudon,
the point of land that first
strikes the sailor's eye as he leaves
the coast of Africa, and which on
exceptionally clear days is dimly
visible even from the coast itself.
Next to it comes Le Phare Pharon,
a lower mountain crowned by a
fort. I know few views which
<pb n='022'/><anchor id='Pg022'/>
combine such an exquisite variety
of form and color as this. The
small cork-trees and the stunted
oaks, equally beautiful, whether
wearing their russet leaves through
the brief winter, or almost matching
the cork-trees in dark-green
foliage; the olives, here of a very
respectable size, with their gnarled
trunks and fantastic shapes; and
then the patches of vivid-green
corn, winter peas, and the green artichokes;
the undulation of the land,
assuming every shade from deep
violet to light red&mdash;make altogether
one of the loveliest views I know
anywhere. But then, I am bound
to acknowledge that there are not
many such in the neighborhood of
our much-loved Hyères, and that,
on the whole, the simple little place
has far less beauty to recommend
it than many of the towns along
the Riviera. Its great merit for
invalids arises from the air being
a good deal softer than at most of
the sea-coast resorts of the sick.
Mary could sit out for hours in the
open air at Hyères, when at Cannes,
and even at San Remo, she could
only have driven in a close carriage;
for, in spite of the brilliant sunshine
in those places, the air is apt to be
too exciting both for irritable lungs
and susceptible nerves. One reason&mdash;probably
the principal reason&mdash;for
this is that Hyères is three
miles from the sea, and more in the
mountains than are the towns of
the Riviera generally.
</p>

<p>
We had a lovely afternoon journey
from Hyères to Cannes; passing
numerous little bays and creeks
where the blue waters lay in deep
repose, or fringed with tiny wavelets
that but kissed the shingly
shore, and died in a gleam of light.
As you looked down on them from
the railway-carriage, you felt you
might have seen a mermaid combing
her sea-green hair, or a cupid
astride a dolphin, as quite an expected
vision. The intense blue
sky and deeper blue sea, the various-tinted
rocks, and perhaps a
solitary pine hanging over, and
near by a group of the same, with
their dense crowns of ever-murmuring
boughs, through which the
evening air sings like the hum of
winged insects, were each so full of
harmonious and yet gorgeous color
that they leave on the mind the impression
of a Greek idyl, full of
serene beauty&mdash;mere beauty, it may
be&mdash;but intense, placid, and eternal.
There are scenes in nature
that are like the forms in Greek
art. They are one; and they are
typical. No wide view, albeit
glorious, can produce this effect,
however much it may appeal to
the imagination. But a rock-bound
cove on the Mediterranean, with its
sparse vegetation and its depth of
color, is as suggestive of thoughts
beyond itself as is the pure grace
of a Greek statue. It belongs to
another world than ours, and to a
region of thought rarely lighted on
in these times, and then by a few
only. When I question myself of
the <q>why,</q> I am at a loss to answer.
Perhaps it lies in the fact that, to
produce this abstract effect on the
mind, the objects in nature must
be few, simple, and perfectly beautiful
of their kind. Then they recall
Greek art, in which there is no
multiplicity, no overlaying, but
which represents as absolutely a
pure idea as it is possible for art to
do. It is without subtlety, as it is
without crowding. It can be felt
better than described, for the feeling
is too deep for words. Nothing
in English scenery, no accidental
combination of beauty, has ever
brought the Greek <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>geist</foreign> before my
mind. Never for a second, amid
<pb n='023'/><anchor id='Pg023'/>
the birchen groves and flower-fringed
lanes of my own land, had I
thought of old Greece and the old
Greek feeling. Pantheism would
not be the natural religion of our
northern skies. Never had I so
strongly felt the tie between nature
and art, and, as a necessary sequence,
between nature and Grecian
thought, till I had wandered on the
pale sands by the calm blue waters
of the tideless sea. It is like a
floating essence, too intangible for
words. If I could express it, the
expression would perforce be brief
and veiled. I would sing my idyl
to a three-stringed lute, or paint
my white nymph against a whiter
sky.
</p>

<p>
It was essential to Mary not to
live close to the sea, therefore we
engaged apartments at Cannes in
one of the hotels situated among
the hills, and full a mile and a half
from the coast. It so happened
that nearly all the people whom we
met at the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>table-d'hôte</foreign> were English
like ourselves, or rather British,
for some came from the Emerald
Isle; and amongst these a family
of three charming girls, full of the
spirit and humor of the race. They
had with them an elderly maid, who
had been their nurse, and whose
quaint sayings afforded us much
amusement while we were there.
She had joined them only just before
we arrived, bringing out the
third sister, who had shown symptoms
of delicacy like the second,
and both were under the supreme
care of the elder sister. Mrs.
O'Brien had managed her journey
in foreign parts very cleverly,
though making every inch of the
way under protest at the heathenish
customs and abominable practices
of these <q>foreigners,</q> as she
deigned to call the French in their
own land.
</p>

<p>
It had been with the greatest
difficulty that she had, on leaving
Ireland, been prevented from taking
with her a large boxful of household
stores, which, as she expressed
it, would be such a comfort to
<q>those poor darlints, just starvin'
in foreign parts, with nothing but
kickshaws and gimcracks to keep
the life in them.</q> In spite of all
the remonstrances of her master, she
had actually succeeded in so far
cheating the custom-house that she
had smuggled <q>jist a nice little
hand of pork, salted down at home,</q>
among the young ladies' linen.
Norah flew into our room, amid
fits of laughter, to show it to
us, and to consult upon how we
could possibly get it boiled. We
could not insult the hotel by asking
that it might appear at the
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>table-d'hôte</foreign>; and a hand of pork
was rather a peculiar dish for three
young ladies to keep up in their
bedroom for private eating. On
the other hand, Mrs. O'Brien would
never recover it if her eleemosynary
offering were discarded. It
ended in my explaining the state
of the case, under seal of secrecy, to
the landlady; and then we actually
held a supernumerary feast in
our drawing-room, at a late hour,
all to show Mrs. O'Brien that her
kindness was appreciated. We did
not sleep particularly well that
night, and the rest was made into
sandwiches and eaten on our next
excursion up the mountains.
</p>

<p>
Mary and Mrs. O'Brien became
great friends; for Mary's sympathetic
nature and marvellous control
of countenance at once drew
the old lady out, and prevented her
discovering how intensely amused
her listener was. Amongst other
topics, she was very eloquent upon
the subject of the Prince of Wales'
recovery from his serious illness,
<pb n='024'/><anchor id='Pg024'/>
declaring how she, <q>as is a nurse
myself, know well what a fine
healthy man he must have been
born ever to have got over the like
of that. And now, sure, we must
pray that nothing may happen to
the blessed, darlint prince; for if he
were to be taken, the country would
be just ruined, and nothing left us
but the constitution!</q>
</p>

<p>
She would talk by the hour of her
<q>darlint</q> young ladies, sometimes
blaming their conduct, sometimes
extolling them to the skies. Occasionally,
to tease her, they would
pretend to walk lame, and tell her
that was all the fashion, and was
called the Alexandra limp. <q>Och!
now, honeys, you, with straight limbs
as God has made you, mocking at
the darlint princess, as may be isn't
lame at all. If I saw you mocking
at me, as is no princess, but is blind,
and me groping round the table,
don't you think, honeys, as I should
feel it?</q> Then turning to Mary:
<q>Ah! your honor, they was always
as wild as a litter o' pigs on a
windy day, good luck to them. I've
seen them all come into the world,
bless their hearts, one after the
other, pretty nigh as fast as nature
would let them. And a nice handful
I've had wid them, too, bringing
the most of them up by hand like a
weaned calf. Children's stomachs
is just like sponges. But if you
overdo the binding, may be you'll
give them obdurate bowels.</q> Mary
bore even this without a smile;
but we all laughed together when
the morning after her arrival she
found the nice little boy Celestin,
who brought in the lamp and the
basket of wood, and helped in the
house generally, and who could not
have been above fifteen, innocently
aiding Marie, the housemaid, in making
the beds. She could not understand
a word of French, and of
course he knew no English; but
she seized him by the collar, and
ejected him violently from the
room, exclaiming, <q>Get out o' that,
you young varmint!</q> and protesting
that he should never touch one
of her <q>darlints' sheets in this
heathenish land, where they made
no difference between a man and a
woman, but put the men to make
the beds and the women to tend
the cattle.</q> The end of it was that
she took the bed-making into her
own hands, though she never got
reconciled to the mattresses stuffed
with the outer sheaths of the Indian
corn, or the pillows with wool.
<q>That pillow is as hard as a dog's
head, and won't do for my young
lady; and the other's as limp as a
dead cat,</q> she remarked aloud to
herself one day that Elina was
going to bed early with a bad
headache.
</p>

<p>
By degrees we became rather
well acquainted with the other
visitors at the hotel, which arose, no
doubt, from the fact of our all being
fellow-countrymen. For a long
time Mary was the only married
woman of the party; and with the
exception of the three merry Irish
girls, the ladies were all old maids
like myself. Frank found Cannes
rather slow, as he expressed it, and
spent the greater part of the six
weeks we were there in making excursions
in the neighborhood, stopping
away three or four days at a
time. It was long before we got
thoroughly comfortable with any of
our fellow-sojourners in a strange
land. In the first place, we were
the only Catholics, and most of
the others were very decided Protestants,
and so rather shunned us at
first. Some of them especially objected
to Mary, and seemed to
think that her good looks and her accurate
French pronunciation were
<pb n='025'/><anchor id='Pg025'/>
rather offensive than otherwise. It
made no sort of difference to her, and
I am sure she never even found it
out. One day, as I was coming
down-stairs, Miss Marygold was
crossing the wide passage which
went from the entrance to the dining-room
door. As I passed her,
she tossed her head, and said, <q>I
have just met your sister, Miss Jane,
going out for a walk, and looking
about five-and-twenty. I must say
I think it must be very <emph>inconvenient</emph>
not to show one's age better than
that.</q> <q>At any rate,</q> said I, <q>it is
an inconvenience, Miss Marygold,
that many would be happy to share
with her.</q> And I swept along the
wide passage lined with oleanders,
myrtle, and cypress in large pots,
sat down to the piano in the public
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salon</foreign>, and dashed through the overture
of <q>Robert le Diable</q> with
much brilliancy of execution. I
afterwards found out that both the
Miss Marygolds strongly objected
to a little red bow which Mary was
apt to fasten in her hair when we
went down to dinner. Their own
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>coiffures</foreign> resembled either a doll's
apron stuck on the top of her head,
or a small <q>dress-improver</q> of stiff
lace. I suppose they thought there
was some virtue in wearing
what was at once ugly and ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
No one, on first arriving at Cannes,
can form any idea of the exquisite
beauty that will be within
their easy reach as soon as they
get beyond the long, straight street
parallel with the flat coast. The
town itself has no pretensions to
beauty, except from the picturesque,
fortified old church, standing
high above the town, and whose
mouldering walls assume so many
different tints against the dark-violet
background of the Estrelle;
that beautiful line of mountains
that runs far out into the sea, and
forms the most prominent object
of the scenery. The market is
held down the one long street,
where it opens on the small garden
and esplanade by the shore. This
is planted with magnificent plane-trees,
and nothing can be more
picturesque than the groups of
peasant-women, with their bright-colored
kerchiefs crossed over
their shoulders, and their thick
woollen skirts, sitting each at her
little booth of cakes, or sweets, or
household utensils, and especially
the charming little crocks, pots,
and pans of native manufacture.
At a short distance from Cannes, at
Valory, there is a very fine establishment
of pottery works, well worthy
of a visit. The native clay produces
the most beautiful colors;
and as the numerous visitors at
Cannes have taken pains to supply
the manufactory with very good
models taken from the antique
and from some of the best specimens
of Minton and Staffordshire
china, the result is most satisfactory.
We found that they are in the
habit of sending very large crates
of garden-vases, besides smaller and
more delicate articles, all over
Europe. The road along the
coast towards Antibes is bordered
by beautiful villas with gardens
running down towards the sea, and
generally laid out in terraces. Even
now, in the month of January, they
were full of roses, geraniums, ageratum,
and violets in bloom. Part
of this picturesque spot is called
California, on account of the bright
yellow blossom of the mimosa,
which, when fully out, is truly
<q>a dropping well of gold.</q>
The light, feathery flower covers
the whole tree, and there is scarcely
a leaf to be seen. The beautiful
eucalyptus, or blue gum-tree, is
<pb n='026'/><anchor id='Pg026'/>
much cultivated here. The peculiar
variety of its foliage, the lower
and older leaves being almost
heart-shaped, and the upper ones
often a foot in length, and hardly
two inches wide, makes it very remarkable.
The lower leaves are
of a blue green, shading off into
deep bronze, and the new shoots
are almost yellow. It is quite recently
that this beautiful tree has
been transplanted from Australia
to Europe; but as it makes twenty
feet in a year, there are already
magnificent specimens. It has a
highly aromatic gum; and it is
supposed that in time it will greatly
supersede the use of quinine,
having medicinal properties which
resemble that invaluable remedy,
while it will be less expensive.
When Mary is suffering from one
of her neuralgic headaches, nothing
relieves her so much as
steeping the long leaves of the
eucalyptus in hot water, and holding
her head over the perfumed
steam. A branch hung near the bed
is also, they say, conducive to sleep.
</p>

<p>
The beauties of the position
of Cannes are far outdone by that
of the little town of Cannet, distant
about three miles, and built
among the mountains, and where
the air is softer. Nothing can exceed
the loveliness of the view
from the Place, shaded by splendid
plane-trees, of the half-deserted
little town, or the same view seen
from the terrace of the one <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Pension</foreign>,
where we found every preparation
for receiving guests, but which was
locked up and entirely empty.
You overlook numerous orange-gardens
of the most vivid green,
the starry blossoms and golden
fruit gleaming amid the foliage.
Then, far down the valley, and
clothing an amphitheatre of hills
and mountains, are groves of olives,
with their soft velvet folds, mass
overlapping mass of tender, dim
green, shimmering all over with silver
touches, as the air stirred the
branches, and turned upwards the
inner lining of the leaves&mdash;after
which all other foliage is apt to
look crude and hard. The blue
sea lies beyond, and the sharp,
purple outline of the Estrelle;
while to the right the mountains
fade off further and further, ending
in snow-capt heights.
</p>

<p>
From amid the dense, soft shadows
of the valley rise the old tower
of the church and the picturesque
cupolas of the strange Moorish villa
where poor Rachel, the famous
French tragedian, breathed her
last, and which is fast falling to
decay. It is no longer let to
strangers; but we made our way
through the tangled gardens and
wilderness of orange-trees. Everything
looked tumbling to pieces.
The house itself is in ruin; and
being painted in bright colors externally,
and chiefly built of wood,
at least in the ornamental parts, it
looks like the cast-off decorations
of a dismal theatre. Two white
pigeons were picking up the scattered
grain in the little, untidy
court. A few mutilated plaster figures
of gods and goddesses near
the entrance added to the tawdry
and unreal aspect of the whole. It
was as if the poor actress had selected
it to die in for its scenic effect,
and so had closed her life on
a mute and deserted stage. I fancied
I could see her lithe form
and her sinuous glide (for she
never seemed to walk like a common
mortal) along the veranda. I could
recall the intense passion of her
matchless voice as she thrilled you
through with the words:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>Je ne me verrai point préférer de rivale.</q></l>
<l>Enfin, tous tes conseils ne sont plus de saison:</l>
<l><q rend='post'>Sers ma fureur, Œnone, et non pas ma raison.</q></l>
</lg>
</quote>

<pb n='027'/><anchor id='Pg027'/>

<p>
And then she came here, alone, to
die! As I turned away from the
place, so beautiful even in its desolation,
I wondered if the rumor
might be true which was prevalent
at the time&mdash;that her maid, a French
Catholic, seeing her poor mistress
in a state of coma just before her
death, had dared to baptize her&mdash;and
thus give us a large-hearted
hope for the woman and the
Jewess.
</p>

<p>
We drove through the narrow,
sharp-angled streets of the little
town of Cannet to the church in
the valley. The streets were so
narrow, and the turnings were so
sharp, that it always seemed that
our horses were in one street while
we and the carriage were in another.
Three little children, with
bright, dark eyes and tangled hair,
hung over a wall, each with a rose
in its mouth. They looked as if
they would drop the flowers, and
themselves after, into our laps.
The church was very clean and
well cared for; full of tawdry
decorations, but fresh and neat, as
if all were often renewed by loving
hearts, if not by cultivated taste.
M. le Curé is very old, and has not
sufficient help for the wants of so
large a parish; and there are no
Sisters to teach the children. They
seem a simple people; and if only
there were a habitable house, what
pleasure might be found in living
in this earthly paradise, and working
amongst them!
</p>

<p>
It is said that the Englishman
carries Bass' pale ale and Warren's
blacking with him where-ever
he goes, to say nothing of
Harvey's sauce. At any rate, he
has established his own special
amusements at Cannes, with no
apparent consciousness of their
incongruity with the scene around
them. Of course we took our
share, though denouncing and protesting
all the way at the horrors
of pigeon-shooting. We drove
over sandy lanes close to the shore,
through groups of pine-trees on
either side; a glorious panorama
of mountains and snow-clad peaks
beyond, the dark-blue sea, and
the purple Estrelle. There was
a vulgar booth and a shed, and
some rickety benches like those
at a country fair. We sat down,
facing three boxes, in which the
innocent birds were concealed until
the moment&mdash;unknown, of course,
to the sportsman himself&mdash;when,
bursting open, the pigeons spread
their wings at liberty, to be perchance
instantly killed by a clever
shot. I acknowledge that I tried
not to look, and that my heart
gave a spasmodic leap every time
I heard the clap of the lid of
the box and then the sharp shot.
I looked at the pine-trees and the
far-off mountains, with the many-tinted,
undulating middle distances,
and tried to forget the coarseness
and cruelty of the scene I was
supposed to have come to as
an amusement. The nuts and the
ginger-bread were wanting, and
Aunt Sally was distinguished by
her absence; but there was nevertheless
a milder reflection of everything
that might have graced this
same kind of scene in England;
and so the English gentleman of
the XIXth century, brought by
fortuitous circumstances into a
new and exquisitely beautiful land,
was doing his best to make himself
<q>at home,</q> and to inspire the
natives and foreigners with his own
tastes. I am fond of sport, though
I am but an old maid; but somehow
this does not strike me as
being sport in the true acceptation
of the word. And I sat wondering
how long it will be before
<pb n='028'/><anchor id='Pg028'/>
my own brave countrymen, who
are already addicted to <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>battues</foreign>,
will build one-storied, round summer-houses
in their woods, painted
inside with arabesques, Cupids,
Venus, and Diana, and having six
or eight small windows all round
it; then, seated in a large gilt
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>fauteuil</foreign>, with a bottle of choice
Chambertin by his side, he will
languidly pop his short gun at the
thrushes or the finches as they
flutter from bough to bough before
him; and so, at the end of a
couple of hours, saunter home
with a bagful of <q>game,</q> wearied
with the exertions of <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>la chasse au
tire</foreign>, like the gentlemen in France
in the times of <hi rend='italic'>La Régence</hi>.
</p>

<p>
The Duc de P. was there, and
the Duc de C., and the Duke of H.,
and actually one of the men&mdash;what
may they be called?&mdash;who preside
over the pigeon-shooting at Hurlingham,
and who had been got
over to ensure everything being <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>en
règle</foreign>. What more could any one
want? I wondered to myself
whether the extraordinary beauty
and sublime majesty of the surrounding
scene had anything to do with
enhancing the pleasure of the
pigeon-shooters; whether, in short,
the successful slaughter of the poor
birds was rendered more enjoyable
by the fact of its taking place under
a sky and in a spot fraught with
exquisite beauty; noble and serene,
vast and varied.
</p>

<p>
And if not, why did they not
stop among the cockney flats of
Hurlingham? When all was over
and we returned home, I actually
found myself semi-conscious of a
sort of pride that the best shot, in
this decidedly trying proof of skill,
was an Englishman! So much for
the inconsistency of human, especially
of female, nature.
</p>

<p>
We are in the land of perfumes.
Acres of roses, violets, and other
scented flowers are cultivated solely
for the perfume manufactories at
Grasse, a few miles from Cannes.
Of course, this is not the time of
year to benefit by this exceptional

<head>A National Or State Church.</head>

<p>
Fifty-three peers protested
against the disestablishment of the
Protestant Church in Ireland, <q>because
it is impossible to place a
church disestablished and disendowed,
and bound together only
by the tie of a voluntary association,
on a footing of equality with
the perfect organization of the
Church of Rome.</q> Mr. Disraeli
had previously said the same thing
in the House of Commons: <q>The
discipline, order, and government
of the Roman Catholic Church are
not voluntary. They are the creation
of the simple will of a sovereign
pontiff</q> (if he means Jesus Christ,
the phrase is Catholic), <q>and do
not depend at all on the voluntary
principle.... I maintain that as
long as his Holiness the Pope possesses
Rome, the Roman Catholic
religion, in whatever country it is
found, is an establishment.</q> In
fact, there is a great deal of truth
in these remarks. How, indeed,
can undisciplined guerrillas contend
against a well-trained army of veterans?
How can a number of voluntary
associations, like so many
insurance or stock companies, liable
at any moment to disband, with no
cohesive power, compete with a
grand organization whose charter
is divine, whose officers are divinely
appointed, and whose laws bind in
conscience in spite of adverse imperial,
royal, or republican legislation?
The peers were right; Mr.
Disraeli is partially right. No sect
or combination of sects can for any
length of time, in a fair field, compete
with the Catholic Church.
Hence the cry of the sects in this
country for state aid. The Catholic
Church never asked for it except
as a matter of justice or restitution.
Whenever it was bestowed on her
institutions, it was because they deserved
it. If much was given to
her, it was because her hierarchy or
her religious orders, inspired by
divine zeal, had founded and organized
charitable institutions while
the sects were asleep, lacking even
in sufficient philanthropy, not to
say charity, to provide for the wants
of their own suffering members.
The Catholic Church built and organized
her asylums, schools, and
other institutions, tried to support
them, and did bravely support them,
as she still does in this country, by
the voluntary contributions of generous
Christians, before the state gave
anything. The sects did very little.
They were too indolent, too deficient
in vitality, to do much. They
begged from the state. They threw
the burden on the state; so that,
whereas in Catholic times there
were no state poor-houses, state
asylums, or state charities, now they
swarm. Protestantism is too cold
a system to warm the hearts of men
into life-giving charity; so it depends,
except in rare cases, on the
state for the support of the poor
and the orphans. The money is
taken from the public treasury for
the support of schools, asylums, and
kindred institutions.<note place='foot'>According to Gov. Dix's report for 1874,
our <q>evangelical</q> state church will have to
draw the sum of $8,600,000 (eight million, six
hundred thousand dollars!) out of the public
treasury to erect two <q>evangelical</q> asylums,
one <q>evangelical</q> hospital, and one <q>evangelical</q>
non-sectarian state reformatory! From
the same report we learn that our <q>evangelical</q>
system of public education cost the state for the
year ending September 30, 1873, the sum of
$20,355,341 (twenty million, three hundred and
fifty-five thousand, three hundred and forty-one
dollars!); and that our <q>evangelical</q> state
church owns twenty-seven millions, seventy
thousand, three hundred and ten dollars' worth
of school property! Remember that Catholics
pay their proportion of the taxes, and that most
of the public schools are not only <q>evangelical</q>
in their religion, but some even formally Methodist
by the <q>hymns</q> and prayers taught in
them!</note> Such being
<pb n='030'/><anchor id='Pg030'/>
the case, who can blame Catholics
for receiving a portion of their own
taxes to help their own institutions,
mainly supported on the voluntary
system? Are not the frequenters
of Catholic schools and the inmates
of Catholic institutions the children
and citizens of the state as well as
others? Will the state educate or
support as cheaply as the church
has done, or make as good citizens
as she makes? If Catholic charitable
institutions are abolished, if
Catholic schools are broken up, how
much will it annually cost the state
for the building of new institutions
and for their maintenance? Are
the Sisters of Charity as safe custodians
of the morality of orphans as
the spinsters and political hirelings
of the state institutions? Are teachers
and matrons who work primarily
from a religious motive as apt
to discharge their duty faithfully as
those who labor primarily for the
<q>consideration</q> attached to their
services? Well do the gentlemen
who attack the Catholic Church
know how futile it is for any sect to
strive against her unless backed up
by state aid; and hence, perhaps,
the cry which has recently resounded
throughout our country for a national
or state church&mdash;a national
Protestant church in opposition to
the never-ceasing progress of Catholicity.
</p>

<p>
The late <q>Evangelical Alliance</q>
publicly endorsed the cry of a national
church. The Rev. W. H.
Fremantle, M.A., of London, an
ecclesiastical functionary of the national
church of England, in <q>a
manner,</q> as the report in the
<hi rend='italic'>Tribune</hi> has it, <q>quick and energetic,
and, as he warmed to his subject,
eloquent to a degree which
<emph>elicited great applause</emph>,</q> on October
9, 1873, at a meeting of the <q>Alliance,</q>
urged on his hearers the
advantages and necessity of having
a national church, <q>the true ruling
elders</q> of which should be <q>our
statesmen, our judges, and our officers
who bear the supreme mandate
of the whole Christian community.</q>
With laconic pith, he
said: <q>The Christian nation is a
church.</q> The applause elicited by
his remarks was no doubt due to
the fact that his auditors remembered
how admirably the Christian
<q>statesmen</q> in Congress and
our late Vice-President, some of
our <q>judges,</q> our <q>Evangelical</q>
bankers and merchants, represented
the interests of the Alliance in their
respective avocations! The Rev.
W. J. Menzies, of Edinburgh,
emissary of the national church of
Scotland, seconded and approved
the doctrines of his Episcopalian
brother. In vain did a sturdy
American, the Hon. J. L. M. Curry,
LL.D., of Richmond, try to defend
the American system and
the principles of our Constitution
against these well-fed and well-paid
gentlemen. The rubicund foreigners
of the church establishments of
Denmark, Sweden, and Germany
came to the rescue of their English
and Scottish brethren. They had
preached to the <q>Alliance</q> in
favor of the tithes, taxes, and intolerance
of their own establishments,
and were not willing to allow Mr.
Curry to oppose them. The very
president of the <q>Alliance,</q> himself
an American, was obliged to
coerce the honorable gentleman
<pb n='031'/><anchor id='Pg031'/>
into silence. His voice was drowned
in an <q>evangelical</q> chorus of
national churchmen. We are no
longer, then, astonished to read that
the Rev. Dr. Stoughton, of England,
was greeted in a Protestant Sunday-school
in this city with the anthem
of <q>God save the Queen.</q>
It was not a religious hymn, mark
it well, but an anthem in praise of
the head of a church establishment,
who is more than pope, for she is
<emph>impeccable</emph> as well as infallible, according
to the axiom of English
law that <q>the king can do no
wrong.</q> No longer are we surprised
to learn that the head of another
national church, the would-be pope-Emperor
of Germany, gave the
<q>Evangelical Council</q> his blessing;
that several of our highest
magistrates, unless they are belied,
have been secretly leagued against
the Catholic Church in favor of a
state Protestantism. Newspapers of
reputed rank have been continually
striving to create a Protestant public
spirit in the state, and thus, as
it were, to prepare the way for an
absolute union of church and state
on a Protestant basis. Indeed, we
have a national, or at least a state,
church already; although it has so
far been administered to us only
in homœopathic doses. Have we
not a state school system with a
Protestant Bible on its rostrum?
Have we not <q>Juvenile Asylums,</q>
<q>Soldiers' and Sailors' Homes,</q>
state charitable institutions all controlled
on the Protestant system,
conducted to a great extent by
Protestant clergymen? Are not
the Bibles used in them Protestant?
Are not the school-books essentially
sectarian in which such expressions
as <q>gor-bellied monks,</q> the
<q>glorious Reformation,</q> the <q>great
and saintly Martin Luther,</q> are
frequent? Have we not a Protestant
Indian policy and a Protestant
<q>Freedman's Bureau</q>?
</p>

<p>
It is true you cannot call the
colorless Protestantism of these institutions
peculiarly Methodist, or
peculiarly Episcopalian, or peculiarly
Baptist; but it is nevertheless
Protestantism. We have a name for
it. The late <q>Evangelical Alliance</q>
gives it to us. The word <q>Evangelicalism</q>
will express the Protestantism
of our incipient national
and state churches. We defy any
impartial visitor to the so-called
<q>non-sectarian</q> state institutions to
deny that their chief male officers,
superintendents, guardians, and
teachers have been chosen on account
of their <q>Evangelicalism.</q>
Every one that knows the inner
working of our state institutions for
charitable purposes is aware that
they are mere pastures in which
Evangelical ministers are retired on
salaries of thousands a year taken
from the state pocket.
</p>

<p>
The desire for having a state or
national church is growing stronger.
German imperialism, or pagan Roman
Cæsarism revived, has given
an impetus to it in Europe, in order
to create a foreign public opinion
to sanction its own persecutions
of the Catholic Church at home.
Switzerland has been moved by the
pull of the German wire. Perhaps
the same influence is at work in our
republic. Or is it that a certain
class of the Protestant clergy, dreading
starvation if left depending on
the bounty of flocks that are losing
their Christianity and its generous
impulses, envious of the portly
frames and plethoric purses of the
foreigners of the European establishments
who lately visited our
shores and banqueted at our expense,
long to draw nutriment from
the bosom of an established mother,
rather than risk death from marasmus
<pb n='032'/><anchor id='Pg032'/>
at the breasts of a dry and
barren voluntary system? If this
be the cause of the growing <q>Evangelicalism</q>
of the sects, of their
effort to combine for the purpose
of giving us a national church, let
us devoutly pray that the next
delegates from abroad will be as
spare in person and purse as our
own country parsons. For the
sake of our republican institutions,
may his divine and imperial majesty
of Germany and her gracious ecclesiastical
majesty of England
send hither no more of their rotund
and jocund functionaries, to make
the hearts of our Evangelical clergymen
yearn after the flesh-pots of
Egypt!
</p>

<p>
Or can it be that the venerable
heads of our <q>Evangelical</q> mayors,
governors, and their compeers,
returning in their senility, as is not
uncommon with decaying brains, to
their early loves, are striving to
restore the state establishments of
the old Puritan colonies? The
recollection that all the original
colonies except Catholic Maryland
had a state church has not yet
died out among these <q>Evangelical</q>
ancients. They remember that
so late even as 1793 an attempt was
made even in New York to saddle an
Episcopalian establishment on the
back of our state, and this, too, at
a time when the members of the
Holland Reformed Churches were
in the proportion of fifteen to
one Church-of-Englander! Perhaps
Governor Dix has an agreeable recollection
of this beauteous trait in
the character of his sect. Perhaps
he remembers how well she had battened
on the flesh and blood of the
Irish people for centuries, though
her votaries were not one-twentieth
part of the Irish population. In
1643, the <q>orthodox</q> Episcopalian
colony of Virginia expelled two
New England Puritan ministers;
while the New England Puritans,
by way of <q>Evangelical</q> retaliation,
sent back to Old England two
professors of Anglicanism. The
poor Quakers were driven out by
all the colonies except Catholic
Maryland. Indeed, even our
modern <q>Evangelicals</q> had not
the courtesy to invite them to
their <q>Alliance.</q> In Virginia, the
man who refused to have his child
baptized was fined two thousand
pounds of tobacco. In the colonies
of Massachusetts and New Haven,
for a time only church members
could exercise the full powers of
citizenship. The legislatures of
the New England colonies convoked
even the church synods. These
were truly <q>Evangelical</q> times,
and after these do the <q>Evangelicals</q>
hanker. So late even as 1779
tithes were collected by law in
some of the colonies. In fact, it
was only in 1818 that the separation
of church and state was effected
in Connecticut. But in those
days the Catholics were few, and
nobody feared them. If they had
been as numerous and formidable
then as they are now, the disestablishment
would never have been
accomplished. These were the
halcyon days when, in the words of
Rev. Mr. Fremantle, already quoted,
<q>the Christian nation was a
church,</q> <q>the true ruling elders
of which were statesmen, judges,
and officers who bore the supreme
mandate of the whole Christian
community.</q> What a yearning
there is for the return of those
good times when none but <q>Evangelicals</q>
may hold office to defraud
the revenue, invest in Crédit
Mobilier stock, or manage banking
houses for the purpose of swindling
credulous <q>Evangelical</q> depositors!
</p>

<pb n='033'/><anchor id='Pg033'/>

<p>
It is timely to warn all good citizens
against the Protestant effort
to restore the state-church system
of the early colonies. The Rev.
W. H. Campbell, D.D., of New
Brunswick, at one session of the
<q>Alliance</q> said: <q>Revolution has
everywhere borrowed the force of
its political ideas from the Protestants
of the XVIth century.</q>
Never was language more correct.
Rebellion against lawful authority,
the overthrow of legitimate governments,
the subversion of civil society,
the destruction of law and
order in modern times, are all traceable
to Protestant principles. Nor
can you ever tell where they will
stop. As there is no fixity or certainty
or unalterable code of doctrine
or morals in Protestantism, a
statesman can never tell when its
councils will be impelled by whim,
fanaticism, or prejudice. There is
no telling but that the Protestant
assembly which to-day favors the
state to-morrow will be in revolt
against it. It has been on the side
of unbridled license, of the extreme
of liberty; and, again, it has been the
creature, the slave, the blind instrument
of despotism. A statesman
always knows what to expect from
the Catholic Church and her assemblies.
Her principles are patent,
her system plain, her doctrines unchanging,
her secondary discipline
modifiable according to law or necessity,
but only by the spiritual
power. She is always conservative,
never revolutionary. She gives to
Cæsar what belongs to him, but no
more. She makes a reserve in her
allegiance to the state: she reserves
the rights of God, the rights of conscience.
She must obey God rather
than men when men try to
alter or subvert God's revelation.
If the state wishes to persecute her,
it may begin at once. She has nothing
to hide from the state; and
she will alter nothing of her doctrines.
If the state dislikes her, at
any rate she is an open foe. But
Protestantism is a fickle subject.
Like the ancient pagans, she admits
the supremacy of the state over
her; admits that the church is only
a voluntary corporation subordinate
to the state; yet practically she is
never to be depended on. Fickle
by nature, the state can never tell
when a fit of madness may seize on
her; when her imagination may be
possessed by some idea subversive
alike of good order and even of
morality. We all know the history
of the Anabaptists and Antinomians
in Germany; the deeds of violence
of the Independents in England.
Protestantism, like a wanton filly,
carries the state as a rider, but always
at the risk of its neck. Let
our statesmen, then, beware of the
attempt which is being made to
give us, if not a national, at least a
state church. The threat has been
made that when slavery was abolished,
the next thing to undertake
would be the destruction of the Catholic
Church by the establishment
of a state church.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to show that a national
church is essentially opposed to our
American principles, and that consequently
all attempts to establish
one are anti-American. On this
point many rationalists and infidels
agree with Catholics, as they logically
must when they argue from
sound principles of pure reason or
of pure politics. The Catholic religion
recognizes the competency
of reason in its own sphere, and admits
its logical inerrancy. All the
principles of the natural, political,
metaphysical, or moral order known
with certainty even by those who
do not believe in revelation at all,
are the common property of the
<pb n='034'/><anchor id='Pg034'/>
Catholic Church; for although she
insists on the subordination of reason
to faith, she asserts emphatically
the autonomy of reason, and
condemns those who would abridge
its powers. Hence true statesmen
who judge our Federal or State constitutions
from the viewing-point
of reason alone agree with Catholics
in opposition to the so-called
<q>Evangelicals,</q> the chief of whom
believe in <q>total depravity,</q> the
loss of free will, and unmerited
damnation. The ablest lawyers in
the country teach that the fundamental
idea of our civil government
is that there shall be no interference
of the state in church affairs.
Absolute independence of
the church; no interference of the
state in religious matters&mdash;such is
the <hi rend='smallcaps'>American idea</hi>. It is expressly
laid down in the first amendment
to the Constitution of the United
States that Congress shall have no
power to legislate on religious questions.
The ablest commentary perhaps
ever written on the Constitution
is the <hi rend='italic'>Federalist</hi>; some of the
best articles in which were written
by Alexander Hamilton, whose son
has recently published them. The
teaching of this great man is that
the framers of the Constitution were
especially anxious to eschew church
establishments or state religions in
the policy of our republic. Indeed,
some of the leading authors of the
Constitution were rationalists, and
more afraid of Protestant sectarian
interference in state affairs than
they were of the Catholic Church,
which in their days was not strong
enough to be feared. <q>Our theory
is,</q> writes Gerrit Smith, <q>that the
people shall enjoy absolute freedom
in politics and religion.</q> Of
course this freedom could not exist
if we had a state church. Mr.
Smith, whose intelligence and Americanism
no one can dispute, in his
celebrated letter on the school
question,<note place='foot'>How little publicity the <q>Evangelical</q> press
have given to this letter, because it favored the
Catholics!</note> from which the above
phrase is taken, adds: <q>A lawyer
than whom there is no abler in the
land, and who is as eminent for integrity
as for ability, writes me:
<q>I am against the government's
being permitted to do anything
which can be entrusted to individuals
under the equal regulation of
general laws.</q></q> How few of the
<q>Evangelicals</q> would be willing to
act on this correct interpretation
of our Constitution? How could
they so easily give up the government
pap that nourishes the Methodist
preachers of the <q>Freedman's
Bureau</q> and the <q>Indian Bureau,</q>
not to speak of the other countless
branches of our homœopathic national
church?
</p>

<p>
The attempt to establish a state
church is also opposed to most
of our State constitutions, and
notably to that of New York. The
first constitution of this State was
so essentially hostile to a church
establishment that it contained an
article incapacitating any minister
of the Gospel from holding any
office, civil or military. Tradition
has it that some Episcopalian minister,
playing the political marplot in
the preliminary convention, had so
annoyed Mr. Jay that he had the
article inserted. In 1846, this article
was expunged; and ever
since our State legislature, our public
offices, and even our judiciary,
have been afflicted by ambitious,
incompetent, sometimes even illiterate,
and always bigoted, political
preachers. They are always
striving to inflict on us more and
more of their bigotry, while their
acts show that one of their chief
<pb n='035'/><anchor id='Pg035'/>
aims is to gratify the <q>Evangelical</q>
appetite for power. We must especially
guard our State constitution
from the treacherous assaults
of the sects. Even now their express
provisions are violated or
evaded.<note place='foot'>One of our judges&mdash;an ex-Methodist minister&mdash;lately
in open court violated the parental
right over offspring by sending a Catholic child
to a Protestant establishment in spite of the respectable
father's opposition.</note> They are easily modified.<note place='foot'><p>The following are the words of our State constitution
in regard to religion:
</p>
<p>
<q>The free exercise and enjoyment of religious
profession and worship, without discrimination
or preference, shall for ever be allowed in this
State to all mankind.</q>&mdash;Art. 1, sec. 3.
</p>
<p>
Now, it is known that the <q>free exercise</q> of
the Catholic religion is not <q>free</q> in most of
our state institutions; and in most of them there
is <q>preference and discrimination</q> in favor of
<q>Evangelical</q> clergymen and against the Catholic
Church. The writer could prove by affidavits
that in the very city of New York there is religious
persecution in some of the state institutions, if
the general scope of his remarks permitted him to
go into many details. Where is the Catholic
priest living near a state institution but knows
that there is <q>discrimination</q> made against
him?</p></note>
Some of them are not inconsistent
with a church establishment,
and may at any moment become
the prey of <q>Evangelical</q>
bigotry or fanaticism.
</p>

<p>
Catholics are by conviction opposed
to a change in the character
of our Federal and State&mdash;we speak
of New York&mdash;constitutions. They
do not conflict with the <hi rend='smallcaps'>Catholic
idea</hi>. There is nothing in or out
of the <hi rend='italic'>Syllabus</hi> that is opposed to
our system of government. This
we shall now proceed to show.
Pius IX., on December 17, 1860,
in an allocution condemned a proposition
which begins with these
words: <q><hi rend='italic'>National churches may be
established</hi>.</q> It is number 37 in the
<hi rend='italic'>Syllabus</hi>. We know that it will be
objected to us that the Pope also
condemns the attempt to separate
church and state in countries in
which they are by law united, and
the abstract principle that they
ought to be separate. It is true
that where church and state have
been united, not by force, but by
the nature of things and the sanction
of laws, it is condemnable to attack
their union as iniquitous or
improper; but it is also true that
it is not always obligatory or expedient
on the part of the state, as
such, to establish a church, build
its institutions, and salary its clergy
out of a common fund. The Roman
pontiffs, in the height of their
temporal power, never compelled
the Jews to build with their money
Catholic churches and pay the salaries
of Catholic priests. Let us historically
examine the character of
the union of church and state in
the Catholic countries of Europe,
and we shall find how just, fair, and
honorable such an union becomes.
What was the title to most of the
Catholic church property in Europe?
None better. The barbarian
baron or king, grateful to the
priest, the monk, or the bishop who
had civilized him and taught him
to save his soul, generously built a
church or a monastery and endowed
it. Legacies, donations, free
gifts&mdash;these were the means by
which the bishopric and monasteries
grew rich. No title to property
is better than this, which a thousand
years had sanctioned. Of
course every new donation increased
the power of the church. The temporalities
of the church had natural
influence in the state. The abbots
and bishops were peers of the
realm. The church lived on her
own resources&mdash;neither asked nor
received anything from the state
except protection and liberty. Before
the Reformation, this was
the character of the close union
between the church and state.
After the Reformation, when the
church had lost her power chiefly
through the corrupting influence
of the kings and barons on the
<pb n='036'/><anchor id='Pg036'/>
bishops and abbots, despite the
protests and the efforts of the
popes, the politicians confiscated
the church property. This confiscation
was simply robbery, for the
church corporations, as well as individuals,
had rights which the state
was bound to respect. But it happened,
as it often happens, that
wicked kings or mercenary and unprincipled
politicians used the political
machinery of the state legally
to rob the church. They abused
the right of eminent domain.
Gov. Dix himself, in his annual
message for 1874, limits the exercise
of this right. <q>The right,</q>
says he, <q>of every individual to be
secured in the undisturbed enjoyment
of his property lies at the
foundation of all responsible government.
It is, indeed, one of the
primary objects for which governments
are instituted. To this fundamental
rule there is but one proper
exception. If private property
is needed for public use, it may be
taken by making just compensation
to the owner; but the use must be
one <hi rend='italic'>which is common to all</hi>, or <hi rend='italic'>which
is indispensable to the accomplishment
of some object of public necessity</hi>.
This right of eminent domain, as it
is denominated, is an incident of
sovereignty, and it is one of the
most arbitrary of all the powers of
government.</q><note place='foot'>Will Gov. Dix, therefore, tell us by what
right of <q>eminent domain</q> Victor Emanuel
robbed the Pope and confiscated the church
property? Does Gov. Dix forget that he was one
of those who approved this confiscation at the
great <q>Italian unity</q> meeting?</note> It is unquestionably
the <q>most arbitrary of all the
powers of government,</q> if we consider
how many are the demagogues,
political traders, and mercenary
corruptionists who help to make
the laws in parliaments, congresses,
or State legislatures to regulate the
property of respectable people; and
how often the executive power in
the state, be it imperial, regal, presidential,
or gubernatorial, is wielded
by despotic and corrupt hands.
Imagine a parliament of Communists
using the right of eminent
domain of the state against the
lands and tenements owned by the
Trinity Church corporation of New
York; or an assembly of <q>Evangelicals</q>
legislating in regard to
Catholic church property! The
state in France, for instance, during
the Revolution stripped the church
of her lawful possessions; Napoleon
endeavored to bring order back to
the Republic by re-establishing the
church. But it is plain that the
salary allowed by his concordat in
<hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> 1801 to the clergy, and the
revenue allowed by the state for the
maintenance of church edifices, was
not a tithe of the interest accruing
from the property stolen by the
state from the church. The sum
now allowed to support the Catholic
clergy of France is, therefore, only
a fraction of restitution money due
to them by the state. So it is in
other countries in which the state,
after confiscating the church property,
salaries the clergy. The
church in those countries does not
get her due. She asks no favor
from them; she does not even get
her rights. The propositions in the
<hi rend='italic'>Syllabus</hi> referring to the union of
church and state must be explained
in the light of these facts. The
Catholic Church does not go to
China or to Turkey, and say to the
governments of those countries:
<q>You must establish me here; you
must build my temples and schools
and asylums.</q> No, she claims
no right of eminent domain over
the pockets of infidels; and even
when she converts them, she only
asks their voluntary aid. All she
asks is liberty to work and protection
<pb n='037'/><anchor id='Pg037'/>
in her legitimate duties. She
and her converts will do the rest.
This was all she asked of the Roman
emperors; this she asked of the
mediæval kings. If they gave her
liberty and protection, she thanked
them, blessed them, worked for
them, and civilized them. If they
refused, still she blessed them and
worked in spite of them; for she
must <q>obey God rather than men.</q>
She might with justice ask more
than this in Prussia or England or
Sweden; for there she might ask
back her stolen property. But in
this country she only asks a fair
field and no favor. Contrast her
conduct with that of Protestantism.
Protestantism goes to the state
begging on her knees; admitting
the state's supremacy over her;
confessing that she is the humble
servant of the king; and asks his
gracious bounty. She will gladly
sit on the foot of his throne as his
slave, though a dangerous and
treacherous one, if he will only
smile on her, clothe and feed her.
She will even stoop to become the
receiver of stolen goods. Is it not
so? Where is there a national
Protestant church really established
that is not living on property stolen
by the state from the Catholic
Church? Look to England and
Scotland. Are not the Protestant
establishments in those lands the
possessors of ill-gotten goods&mdash;of
lands and churches iniquitously
stolen from the Catholic Church?
Surely the orthodox Catholic laity
of the middle ages who gave these
demesnes to the monasteries and
churches never intended that the
king should turn them over to a
heretical establishment. The Prussian
establishment is a theft from
beginning to end; for every one
knows that the apostate head of the
Catholic religious order which ruled
the duchy of Brandenburg, and laid
the foundation of the Prussian power,
had no right to transfer the
property of his order to a Protestant
clergy. Who could defend such a
proceeding? Would our <q>Evangelical</q>
brethren approve the conduct
of a Protestant board of trustees
or vestrymen who, on being
converted, or a majority of them
being converted, to the Catholic
faith, should by a trick transfer the
property of their congregation,
their church, or college to the
Catholic authorities to be used for
Catholic purposes? How, then,
can they approve the conduct of
the English, German, and Scandinavian
clergy who have received
the lands and buildings taken from
the Catholics by violence and regal
usurpation? There is truly a very
great difference between the Protestant
and Catholic church establishments
of Europe&mdash;a difference
in origin, as well as in the manner
of their continuance&mdash;and this difference
is by no means flattering to
the honesty or manliness of the
sects. Correctly, therefore, did we
say that Catholic principles as well
as true American principles are opposed
to a state church establishment
in this country, and that
nothing in the <hi rend='italic'>Syllabus</hi> condemns
our system of government.
</p>

<p>
It is time, therefore, for all true
American citizens to unite under
the Catholic standard of opposition
to national or state church establishments.
The rights of conscience,
the rights of religion, are
the rights of God. They are not
national, but universal; that is,
catholic. We are not willing to
come back to the pagan <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>régime</foreign> of
Roman Cæsarism, and admit the
ruler of the state or the state itself
as supreme master of religion as
well as of politics. The <q>Evangelical</q>
<pb n='038'/><anchor id='Pg038'/>
semi-paganized Protestants of
Germany may bow the knee to the
modern Cæsar, and admit him to
be supreme pontiff; but they must
keep their despotism at home.
The Swiss <q>Evangelicals</q> may
revive the ancient Spartan worship
of the state, and assert its supremacy
in spiritual matters; but they
must keep their statolatry from our
shores. The true American, like
the true Catholic, will bow the knee
to no idol, not even to the state,
much as he may love it. He
adores only his God. The state
shall not interfere with his conscience,
or dare to come between
him and his God, no matter how
much these foreign <q>Evangelical</q>
emissaries may wish it. He is
Catholic, even when he least suspects
it. He hates despotisms, as
the Catholic Church does; he suspects
that German <q>Evangelicalism</q>
is only a livery stolen to cover
unbelief, as the Catholic Church
knows it to be. He suspects the
sincerity of those foreign <q>Evangelical</q>
emissaries and their native
hypocritical associates who preach
in favor of state-church establishments;
he suspects them as traitors
to American liberty or as seekers
for notoriety or a full purse. When
his suspicions have been clearly
proven correct, he will turn from
the sects in disgust, to love the
grand old church which can be
controlled by no national or state
limits, and which has been battling
all her lifetime against emperors
and kings for the very principles
of liberty that constitute the glory
and the greatness of our republic.

<p>
Now, to quiet your mind&mdash;for you
must be as shocked as I am at all
these horrors&mdash;we will speak, if you
please, of our friend Jean-Louis.
On the afternoon of the day which
proved the last for the innocent
Barbette, Jeannet, knowing that the
wood-cutters would be dismissed,
and that consequently he would
have some leisure time, went off to
the Luguets' to have a little consoling
conversation with good
Solange. He kept no secrets from
her, and expected great relief in
recounting faithfully all that had
happened; but, on entering, he instantly
perceived something new
had occurred in the house. The
men were out at work; Mme. Luguet
was seated by the fire, weeping
bitterly; and Solange, sitting on a
stool at her feet, was speaking to
her in an angelic voice of her desire
to enter a convent. Jeannet
discreetly wished to withdraw.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't go,</q> said Solange to him;
<q>isn't it so, mother? Jeannet will
not disturb us?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, dear; on the contrary, my
child, I am happy to see you, Jean-Louis.
Is it true that you will be free
to accompany Solange to Paris?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alas! Mme. Luguet,</q> replied
Jeannet, <q>why should I not be free,
having neither family nor friends,
save only you and yours? The
only roof that sheltered me from
infancy is henceforward forbidden
to me, without counting that, before
many hours, the only thing
that I can call my own&mdash;on condition
that God leaves it to me&mdash;and
that is my life, may be taken also.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What has happened?</q> asked
Solange. <q>You speak in a quiet,
serious tone that frightens me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have done my duty, dear Solange,
and often in this world, after
performing an act of conscience
and justice, any consequence may
be expected.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he related that, having discovered
the criminal dealings of
Isidore with the brigands of <hi rend='italic'>La
Martine</hi>, he had been obliged to
threaten the future husband of
Jeannette, and give him warning
that he must leave the country.
</p>

<p>
<q>But,</q> cried Solange, <q>that is
just what I hoped; this fortunate
event divine Providence has allowed,
that Jeannette might be saved.
Rejoice, then, Jeannet, instead of
indulging in such gloomy ideas.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are very kind to think
so,</q> replied Jean-Louis sadly; <q>but
I, Solange, see things differently.
Jeannette, already so irritated, will
not pardon me for saving her at
the expense of Isidore, who is not
the man to let himself be crushed
like a wolf caught in a snare.
Much will be said against me; I
will be rashly judged, and less than
ever will I have the right to present
myself at Muiceron. No, no; from
that dear spot I am for ever separated.
I have been already accused
of jealousy; shall I expose myself
to Jeannette's reproaches that
I have denounced Isidore to prevent
her marriage?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I acknowledge,</q> said Solange,
<pb n='040'/><anchor id='Pg040'/>
<q>that your reflections are just.
The truth will one day be known,
but it will take time; I see it as
well as you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I must expect the vengeance of
the Perdreaux,</q> continued Jean-Louis,
<q>as well as of their friends,
whose violent passions I know, and
who will not leave me in peaceable
possession of their secrets. Michou
has discharged the workmen; apparently,
they went off contented.
But Isidore, meanwhile, received my
letter; no doubt before this he
has communicated it to his cut-throat
companions, and the easiest
thing for all of them will be to get
rid of me at the shortest notice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My God!</q> said Solange, <q>why
didn't you think of all that before
writing the letter? At least, you
need not have signed it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I thought of all that,</q> replied
Jeannet, smiling; <q>but even if I
had been sure of risking my life in
saving Jeannette, I would not have
stopped. Her father and mother
preserved my existence, Solange,
and therefore it belongs to them.
And as for not signing such a letter,
thank God! you think so because
you are a woman, that you love
me, and that you feel I am in danger;
but if you were in my place,
you would think as I do.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My children,</q> said Mme. Luguet,
<q>you are both right. But my
advice is that just now you had
better plan for the future than discuss
the past.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell us what shall be done,
mother,</q> said Solange. <q>In the
first place, Jean-Louis must not return
to the wood to-night; isn't
that so?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't think of such a thing,</q>
cried Jeannet, as he rose hastily
from his chair. <q>Did I come here
to hide?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Be still,</q> said Solange with
authority; <q>don't be so proud. We
all know you are brave, who, then,
can accuse you of flying from danger?
But courage does not consist
in throwing yourself headlong in
the midst of it, but in providing
against it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will return,</q> said Jeannet,
<q>Michou expects me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You will not return, my child,</q>
said Mme. Luguet. <q>I will direct
you for one day; my age and friendship
permit me. I order you to
remain with us to-night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But,</q> said Jean-Louis, <q>tomorrow
the danger will be still
greater; and, my good mother, you
surely cannot count on keeping me
a prisoner?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>When you came in,</q> said the
good woman, <q>Solange was asking
my permission to leave home. It
was very painful for me to decide,
and I sought to gain time from the
good God&mdash;a little time only, to become
more courageous; for never
will I be so bold as to refuse to
give my child to the Lord. Well,
what you have just related makes
me think the good God has directed
all with his own voice. My
dear children, you will leave tomorrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
Solange threw herself on her
knees, and laid her head on her
mother's hands, which she kissed,
weeping. Jean-Louis turned pale.
His courage, which prompted him
to face the danger, and his desire
to oblige his friends, struggled
violently in his heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen to me,</q> said he. <q>I gave
my word to Solange that I would
accompany her; but circumstances
have changed since then. Cannot
Pierre take my place? They have
gossiped about Solange and me,
dear Mme. Luguet; what will they
say when they hear we have gone
off together?</q>
</p>

<pb n='041'/><anchor id='Pg041'/>

<p>
<q>Pierre!</q> cried Solange; <q>but
he knows nothing, nor my father
either. My mother alone has my
secret; otherwise, it would be impossible
for me to leave.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is true,</q> said Mme. Luguet;
<q>my men are good Christians, but
not pious enough to understand
Solange's wishes. However, with
the blessing of God, I will manage
them. It is decided that I will tell
the father she has only gone for a
fortnight, to see how she likes it;
there will be a fuss at first, and
then we will go to see her; and if,
as I believe, the good God will
take her entirely to himself, then
the sight of her happiness will
satisfy all our hearts.</q>
</p>

<p>
Thus spoke that good Christian
woman; and to the shame of many
great ladies of the city, who show
themselves so unreasonable under
similar circumstances, I must say,
with truth, she was not the only one
in our village you might have heard
speak in the same manner.
</p>

<p>
Jean-Louis could urge no further
objection. The public stage, which
would carry them to the nearest
railway station, passed the Luguets'
house every morning at six o'clock.
At that time of year, it was still
dark, and the men, who rose at four,
that they might go to the barn and
comb the hemp, went to bed very
early in the evening. Pierre and
his father entered and supped, without
anything being said before
them, and Solange and her mother
found themselves again alone with
Jeannet as the village clock struck
eight.
</p>

<p>
It was then that Jeannet wrote
the short note to Jacques Michou
which we have already read; he
ran and placed it in the box in the
suburbs of the village, and quickly
returned, as Solange had told him
she would be half dead with fear
during his absence, and that she
would pass the time on her knees,
saying her rosary.
</p>

<p>
You see it was very evident the
Lord and his angels watched over
these good people. At this very
hour, when it would have been so
easy to have attacked Jean-Louis,
he came and went through the
wood, without incurring any risk,
while the unfortunate Isidore uselessly
committed a great crime.
</p>

<p>
Good Mme. Luguet and her
daughter remained up until late in
the night, busy making up Solange's
little bundle, in praying, and often
embracing each other, mingling
their tender and holy kisses and
tears. Jeannet aided them to the
best of his ability, admiring the
courage of heart, which was worth
more than that of the head and
arms. Then the two women retired
for a little rest, and he, in his turn,
ended by falling asleep in his chair.
</p>

<p>
At five o'clock, Solange came
herself to awaken him, and told
him, in a low voice, that she had
made her poor mother promise the
night before not to get up, and so
she had just kissed her softly for
the last time without disturbing
her sleep. At that instant could
be seen the heroism of that holy
soul in thus wishing to bear alone
the weight of the sacrifice. Her
face, without ceasing to be calm,
was bathed in tears, and from time
to time she kissed a little crucifix
suspended from her neck, in order
to sustain her brave heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come,</q> said she at last, <q>it is
time, Jeannet; let us say the Our
Father together, and then we will
leave.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Courage, Solange,</q> said Jean-Louis,
much moved; <q>the good
God will bless you.</q>
</p>

<p>
They repeated the prayer, and
went out noiselessly, and just then
<pb n='042'/><anchor id='Pg042'/>
was heard the jingling of the bells
on the horses of the country stage.
</p>

<p>
Solange was well wrapped up in
her black cloth cloak, with the hood
drawn down over her face. Jean-Louis
carried her little bundle, in
which she had slipped two of
Pierre's shirts; for the good Jeannet
carried all his baggage on his back&mdash;to
wit, a woollen vest, a blouse, and
his plaid scarf. But, as we have already
seen, it was not his habit to
think of himself.
</p>

<p>
They arrived safely at Paris
that very day, rather late in the
evening, to be sure; and little did
they dream of the great rumpus
going on at that very time in our
poor neighborhood. All along the
route the strong family resemblance
between Solange and Jeannet made
every one think them brother and
sister; and by good luck, owing to
the severity of the weather, none
of the travellers in the coach belonged
to the village or its environs,
so that they reached the station
without the risk of being recognized.
</p>

<p>
The Sister-Superior of the Sisters
of Charity had been notified several
days before of the coming of Solange
by our <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>, who was the
good child's confessor; but they
had left home so suddenly, Jeannet
was obliged to find a refuge for his
companion the first night. Happily,
in Paris all is at your service&mdash;people
and things&mdash;where there is
money, and our children were rich
with Solange's savings; therefore,
there was no difficulty in finding
respectable lodgings, where they
passed the night in two beautiful
rooms, well furnished, the like of
which they had never thought existed,
at least for their use.
</p>

<p>
The next day their first action
was to go and hear Mass, after
which, having inquired the way to
the Convent of S. Vincent de Paul,
which is situated in a very pious
quarter of the city, they went there
with hearts rather saddened; and
one hour later Jeannet found himself
alone in the vast city.
</p>

<p>
But no one is alone in this world
when he carries in his heart faith
in the Lord. All the children of
God belong to one family, and feel
in their souls a fraternal tenderness
for each other. Jeannet, on taking
Solange to the convent, found
a mother in the good superioress,
who received them both. She
made him relate his story to her in
a few words, and, learning that he
was alone in the world and desirous
of some engagement, she gave
him the address of a good priest
who passed his life in aiding young
working-men who, owing to unfortunate
circumstances or lack of
employment, ran the risk of becoming
dissipated from the want of a
helping hand.
</p>

<p>
He was called Abbé Lucas; and
as he is now dead, and enjoying, I
trust, the celestial happiness well
merited by his great devotion, I do
not think it indelicate to tell his
name.
</p>

<p>
He received Jeannet with great
kindness, and the good boy soon
won his heart with his frankness
and amiability. The abbé tried
his hand, and seeing that he wrote
well, and turned off a very good
letter under dictation, advised him
not to think of joining a regiment,
as the conscription would be after
him soon enough without his running
to seek it. Therefore, he took
him in his own house, and employed
him with his correspondence, of
which there was never any deficiency,
owing to the great number of
men who daily claimed his charitable
assistance.
</p>

<p>
The arrangement was perfectly
<pb n='043'/><anchor id='Pg043'/>
to Jeannet's taste, who applied himself
to his new occupation with
joy and confidence; and you can
well imagine that Solange was very
happy, and redoubled her prayers
that her dear school-fellow might
come as triumphantly out of his
heart-troubles as he had been
preserved from the dangers that
threatened his life.
</p>

<p>
She immediately wrote home, informing
M. le Curé of all these
little events, but left it to his great
wisdom to decide whether he
should tell more or less of everything
to the Ragaud family, Michou,
and M. le Marquis. This should
make us thoroughly understand the
true virtue of this good child; for
she had not been ignorant of the
base insinuations made in relation
to her and Jean-Louis, and what
ugly conjectures would be based
upon their departure, Pierre joining
with the rest, at least at the first
news. These things go straight to
the heart of a good, honest girl, and
Solange, being of a quick, nervous
temperament, had suffered martyrdom
from all this gossip without
speaking of it, except to God. It
was to him, then, that she remitted
the care of her full justification, as
she knew many persons would not
have believed anything she might
have said. This beautiful tranquillity
of soul is not an ordinary thing,
and our <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign> judged rightly that it
proceeded from great holiness, as
in the end he did not fail to speak
of it, with profit to his hearers, in
his Sunday sermons.
</p>

<p>
This excellent pastor, who had
been careful to keep clear of the
whole affair before the downfall of
the Perdreaux, contenting himself
with praying and awaiting the
good pleasure of the Lord, reappeared
like an angel of consolation
when nothing was left but tears to
wipe away, hatreds to calm, simpletons
to make hold their tongues,
and truths to make known. It
was wonderful to see how he forgot
his great age and infirmities to
fulfil his task, which was not the
easiest in the world.
</p>

<p>
With the château it was quickly
done. In a conversation of two
hours with M. le Marquis, who
was a man of great good sense&mdash;except
in what touched his political
hopes&mdash;he made the scales fall from
his eyes, and decided his departure;
and as, after all the villany of the
Perdreaux, our master's fortune had
not suffered as much as might have
been expected&mdash;as it was very great,
and could have stood a much
larger rent&mdash;our good pastor reserved
his pity and real work for a
corner of the country where it was
infinitely more needed.
</p>

<p>
You can guess that I wish to
speak of Muiceron. There truly
sorrow, shame, and unhappiness
were at their height.
</p>

<p>
So many blows at once had
crushed the Ragauds, who no
longer dared go out, and remained
at home, devoured with grief. The
old farmer, struck on the tender
side of his pet sin, which was vanity,
thought really that heaven and
earth had fallen upon his shoulders,
and that he should only leave his
home for the cemetery. Pierrette,
long accustomed to receive implicitly
her husband's opinions, thought
also nothing wiser could be done;
and as for Jeannette, overwhelmed
with grief to see herself abandoned
by all her friends at the same time,
although apparently the strongest,
it looked as though she would go
the first to the grave, so plainly did
her pallor and hollow eyes show
the ravages of internal grief.
</p>

<p>
All the joy and life of rural labor
had disappeared from around this
<pb n='044'/><anchor id='Pg044'/>
house, formerly so happy. The
door was closed, the shutters also,
save one or two in the back rooms,
where these poor people kept themselves
hidden, afraid to speak, as
they knew one subject of conversation
was alone possible, and just
then no one would approach it.
The passers-by, seeing the house
shut up, and not supposing all the
inhabitants were dead, ended by
feeling uneasy as they passed the
buildings, but not one ventured to
inquire about them, not even Ragaud's
most intimate acquaintances.
It is only truth to add that these,
understanding well the sorrow that
reigned within those silent walls,
acted thus from respect, and not
from indifference.
</p>

<p>
Big Marion went twice a week
to the market in Val-Saint, to buy
provisions needed for immediate
use, and returned at a gallop, to
shut herself up with her master's
family.
</p>

<p>
Since Muiceron had belonged to
the Ragauds, it was certainly the
first time any food had been cooked
but the beef and poultry raised
and killed on the place. Poor
Pierrette, like all good housekeepers,
had always prided herself
upon supplying the table with the
fruit of her labors; for with us, a
farmer's wife who buys even a
pound of butter or loaf of bread
passes, with good reason, for a
spendthrift; but, alas! self-love was
no longer thought of, and La Ragaude
cared little what was said of
her management, after she knew
tongues could wag about affairs of
much greater importance. Poor
woman! she must have been fearfully
depressed. Judge how the
chickens ran wild, scratching up
the gravel during the day, and
perching on the trees, stiff with
snow, during the night, at the risk
of freezing. The pig, so fat it
could no longer stand on its legs&mdash;as
for a fortnight its true place
would have been in the salt-tub&mdash;continued
uselessly to eat his allowance.
The hens that recommenced
to lay deposited their eggs
at random, without any one taking
the trouble to go after them, notwithstanding
the little <hi rend='italic'>coricoco</hi> of
warning, which showed that they
never failed to cluck at the right
time most faithfully. But Marion
could not see after everything; and
besides, as she had always been
very stupid during the time that
all were well and happy at Muiceron,
she became more and more
stupid and bewildered after affairs
went so badly.
</p>

<p>
Such was the miserable condition
in which our <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign> found his
old friends on the first visit which
he made them, about two weeks
after Barbette's funeral, with the
sole object of raising them from
the deep despondency into which
they had fallen since the terrible
shock.
</p>

<p>
Pierrette received him in the big
parlor, which was very dark, as the
shutters were closed, and for a
quarter of an hour he could get
nothing out of her but sobs; then
Ragaud came in, looking thin
and miserable, as much from want
of air and exercise as from shame;
and finally Jeannette, who, with a
remnant of her old pride, tried to
keep from weeping, but was nearly
suffocated in the effort.
</p>

<p>
<q>My children,</q> said the dear,
good man, <q>God tries those whom
he loves, and I certainly do not approve
of your shutting yourselves
up in this manner, so as to avoid
the society of your neighbors and
friends, on account of a sentiment
which doubtless you think good,
but which I call honor ill placed&mdash;that
<pb n='045'/><anchor id='Pg045'/>
is to say, wicked pride, to
speak frankly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alas!</q> said Pierrette, <q>who
wishes to speak to us now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Whom have you offended?</q> replied
the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>. <q>And why has the
esteem in which you have long
been held diminished?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Monsieur,</q> said Ragaud, <q>my
daughter was on the point of marrying
a revolutionist and an assassin.
That is enough to kill a family like
ours.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I acknowledge,</q> said the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>
quietly, <q>you could have made a
better choice; but, in reality, since
all has ended without your playing
any other part in this unfortunate
affair than that of victims, I do
not see why you should hide yourselves
from the eyes of the world
as though you were criminals.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As for me,</q> said Ragaud, <q>I
can never reappear again in public,
and support the looks and words
of the people around, who certainly
despise us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ragaud,</q> replied the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>, <q>when
a man's shoe hurts him, he usually
sits down by the roadside, and
looks to see whether it is a thorn
or a flint that causes the pain; then
he takes it out, and all is over.
But if, instead of that, he continues
walking, his foot would swell, the
wound would inflame, and the cure
would no longer be easy. Do you
understand me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all,</q> said Ragaud.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nor I either,</q> added Pierrette,
still continuing to weep.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well,</q> said M. le Curé, <q>it
means that a wise man like you
who fears anything of that kind
should seek after the cause, to see if
by chance it would not be as easy
to drive such an idea out of his
head as to take a thorn out of a
shoe. And, between ourselves, it
is precisely your case. Far from
despising you, each and every one
in the neighborhood only feels for
you compassion, sympathy, and
kindness, which they would willingly
show in words and actions. I
am constantly asked about you,
and all desire you to return to the
common life. They do not come
to disturb you, through pure discretion;
but for which, your house
would be well filled. But as long
as you live like wolves in their den,
the pain increases in your heart,
and soon it will be with you as
with the man, wounded in the foot,
who will continue to walk&mdash;you
cannot be cured.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>M. le Curé is right,</q> said
Jeanne; <q>we must reappear, dear
father.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Without counting,</q> resumed
the pastor, <q>that you are not acting
as Christians when you show
so much pride. A Sunday has
passed, and you were not seen at
Mass, and nevertheless it is an obligation.
Do you, then, intend to
neglect your religious duties?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I would go to church if no one
were there,</q> said Ragaud.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it you, my friend, whom I
hear speak thus?</q> replied the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>
sadly. <q>So you prefer the esteem
of men to the blessing of God?
And you, Pierrette, whom I have
always known as such a good parishioner,
have you the same miserable
ideas?</q>
</p>

<p>
The Ragauds lowered their
heads without replying. They
felt they were wrong, especially for
the bad example given their daughter.
Little Jeanne, on her side,
came to a resolute decision.
</p>

<p>
<q>Father and mother,</q> said she,
<q>M. le Curé makes me understand
all my sins; for it is on my account
you are thus borne down with grief.
I, then, must be the first to trample
pride under foot. Well, then, I
<pb n='046'/><anchor id='Pg046'/>
will go to Val-Saint on Sunday,
and assist at Mass and Vespers in
our usual place.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You shall not go alone, my
poor child,</q> said Pierrette.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is right,</q> said the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>;
<q>I expected as much. As for you,
my dear Ragaud, as I know you to
be truly honorable, you will not, I
suppose, allow these two women to
bravely fulfil their duty, and leave
you behind?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will see; I can't promise any
thing,</q> answered Ragaud.
</p>

<p>
<q>I count upon you,</q> said the
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>, pretending to take these
words as an engagement, <q>and I
beg that you will come after Mass
and dine with me; Germaine will
have a nice dish of larks, which
will not be much expense, as in this
snowy weather they only cost five
cents a dozen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Monsieur,</q> said Ragaud, who
felt greatly relieved by this pleasant
conversation, which he very
much needed, <q>commence by taking
supper with me this evening;
it will be a charitable deed to stay
with people who are so unhappy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Willingly,</q> replied the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>;
<q>but with these closed shutters
and cold rooms, that make me
think of a tomb, I will not have
any appetite. You must change
all that, and let in some light.
Come, madame, show us if you
still can turn a spoon in the sauce-pan.</q>
</p>

<p>
Pierrette could not repress a
pleased smile at this apostrophe,
and all her old occupations and favorite
habits came back to her at
the remembrancer, which tickled
her heart. Just as in nursery-tales
a wicked fairy enchants a house for
a time, and suddenly a good one
comes, and with a wave of her wand
changes affairs; at Muiceron, which
appeared desolate and dead, the
words of the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign> restored the old
life and animation which were so
pleasant to behold in the former
prosperous days. Ragaud made a
great fire to drive out the close,
damp smell; Pierrette threw open
the shutters with a quick hand, and,
seeing her garden ruined by the
poultry, she blushed from shame,
and grumbled aloud at her neglect.
That was a true sign that her courage
had returned. During this
time, Jeannette and Marion got
out the linen for the table, wiped
the dishes, gray with dust, and prepared
the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>fricassée</foreign>, which consisted,
for this meal, of a ragout of wild
rabbits that M. le Curé looked at
with a mischievous twinkle in his
eye, as he knew well this game
could only be the result of poaching.
</p>

<p>
<q>There,</q> said he, trying to the
best of his ability to cheer up his
poor friends, <q>is a dish which does
you honor, Mme. Ragaud, and
that will be perfectly delicious if
you will put a glass of white wine
in the sauce. But if you will let
me give you a word of advice, don't
feed those little animals with cabbage.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why not?</q> said Pierrette, astonished,
thinking that M. le Curé
mistook the game for a tame rabbit.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! yes,</q> said he, <q>that animal
smells of cabbage, unless I
have lost the sense of smelling;
and it spoils the taste very much.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, monsieur,</q> answered Pierrette,
half offended, <q>this is a wild
rabbit, caught in the wood of La
Sange.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not possible!</q> cried M. le Curé,
feigning great astonishment. <q>And
since when has the farm of Muiceron,
which I have always seen
the best supplied in the country
with poultry, sheep, pigeons, and
<pb n='047'/><anchor id='Pg047'/>
all other productions, been reduced
to buy game stolen from its master
for food?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Marion bought it,</q> said Pierrette;
<q>the poor girl goes after provisions,
and don't look far; she
brings back what she finds, without
thinking of evil.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So Marion is mistress of the
house now?</q> said the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>. <q>My
dear friends,</q> he added, <q>this is a
little incident which carries a great
moral with it. I wish no further
evidence to prove to you how
much your grief, just at the bottom,
is hurtful and wrong in reality.
When I came in, Pierrette, I
was pained at the disordered appearance
of everything around. In a
little while Muiceron will resemble
the estate of an idle, lazy man
who lets the ground lie fallow.
What an example for the neighborhood,
who looked upon you as
models! Come, come, you must
change all this, my good children.
Commence your work; there is
enough to do. I bet, Ragaud, your
horses have not been curried for
two weeks?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alas! monsieur, you are half
right&mdash;not curried as they should
be,</q> answered Ragaud in a penitent
tone.
</p>

<p>
<q>I must have lost more than six
dozen eggs,</q> said Pierrette, looking
down.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know nothing about the eggs,</q>
resumed M. le Curé; <q>but as for
your chickens, who have not had a
grain of food but the gravel they
have scratched, they are so lean I
wouldn't eat one of them if you
gave it to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
These reproaches piqued the self-respect
of our good people more
than any number of long and learned
speeches uttered in a severe tone.
Pierrette was deeply contrite for
her faults. On setting the table,
she could not keep from the eyes
of M. le Curé, who spied everything
designedly, the six-pound loaf of
white bread which Marion had
that very morning brought home
from the baker's. This loaf, that
was long and split in the middle,
was not the least in the world like
the bread made in the house, and
proved that Pierrette had not
kneaded the dough for a long time.
Our <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign> would not let the bread
pass unnoticed any more than the
rabbit-stew, said it was dry and
tasteless&mdash;which was true&mdash;and
seized this opportunity also to
make his friends promise to resume
their ordinary train of life.
</p>

<p>
The supper was not very gay, it
must be acknowledged, but passed
off quietly, and thus this visit of the
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>, which was followed by many
others, began to bring back peace
in those hearts so crushed with sorrow.
</p>

<p>
The following Sunday, Jeannette,
according to her promise, went to
Val-Saint, accompanied by her parents.
She appeared neither too
proud nor too subdued, but just
between the two&mdash;that is to say,
she moved along with a look of
perfect modesty, which won every
one's respect, and made all the hats
come off as she approached the
church. Unfortunately, it is too
true that human nature is apt to
rejoice over the misfortunes of
others. It is as though each one
said, at the sight of a thwack received
by his neighbor, <q>So much the
more on his back, so much the less
on mine.</q> And I do not conceal
from you that the people of Val-Saint
were not exempt from this
culpable weakness. On this very
occasion even they were disposed to
be severe; for, in fact, the Ragauds'
misfortunes were a little their own
fault; and each one observed that if
<pb n='048'/><anchor id='Pg048'/>
the parents had not been too proud
and ambitious of making their
daughter a young lady, she would
not have been exposed to choose
for husband a scoundrel whom
they thought a gentleman. However,
sincere pity replaced every
other sentiment when they saw
this afflicted family reappear in
broad daylight in such an humble
attitude; and poor Ragaud, who
had made a violent effort to come,
gradually recovered his ease at the
sight of the kind faces that surrounded
him. During the Mass,
his old heart recovered its balance
while praying to God. He felt
that affliction is a good means of
becoming better, because it draws
the soul to its Creator, whom we
are too often tempted to forget in
the days of uninterrupted happiness;
and when the divine office
was ended, he could without difficulty
stop in the village square, and
shake hands with several of his
friends.
</p>

<p>
Then they went to the pastoral
residence, where the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign> received
them joyfully, and they ate with
relish the dish of larks, which was
done to a turn. At the dessert, the
Ragauds looked like people restored
to life, so much balm had that
genial morning infused into their
blood. Jeannette alone did not
share the general happiness, and
her bitter sadness, which could not
be disguised, in spite of the care she
took to smile and speak at the right
time, was visible to all. It must be
said to her praise that her vanity,
which had been so crushed, was
the least wound of her heart; she
felt there another so much deeper,
so much more painful, nothing, she
thought, could ever cure it.
</p>

<p>
Where was Jean-Louis? What
had become of that brother she
had driven out so roughly and unjustly?
Her great seclusion since
the terrible event had prevented
her hearing a single word about
him, and she dared not question
any one.
</p>

<p>
As for the Ragauds, father and
mother, they never mentioned him
either, but for another reason. Ignorant
that Jeannette had turned
the poor boy out of the house, they
were still firmly convinced of his
jealousy; and as they believed him
to be employed on some farm in the
neighborhood, they were very much
incensed at his prolonged absence,
which, in view of the present circumstances,
appeared the act of an
ungrateful and hard heart.
</p>

<p>
M. le Curé, who knew all, and
had Solange's letter in his pocket,
designedly prolonged the grief of
Jeannette and the mistake of the
Ragauds, in order that the lesson
might be duly profitable to all.
</p>

<p>
<q>You see,</q> said he, <q>everything
has happened as I foresaw. Fearing
to displease you, I did not invite
any one to our little entertainment;
but understand well, my children,
if I had had fifty vacant
places at my table, I would have
had great difficulty in choosing my
guests; so many would have desired
the pleasure of dining with you, I
would have been afraid of exciting
jealousy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>M. le Curé,</q> said Ragaud, <q>I
thank you, and hope that your
kindness was not mistaken. I
speak the truth when I say that,
but for you, I would have died
rather than ever again have shown
my face in public.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, now that it is all over, let
us talk of our friends,</q> replied the
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>. <q>Are you not curious to
hear some news?</q>
</p>

<p>
No one replied; the tender chord
was again touched.
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not conceal the fact,</q> said
<pb n='049'/><anchor id='Pg049'/>
Ragaud, <q>that more than one of
those so-called <emph>friends</emph> have pained
us by their neglect.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us be just,</q> said the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>;
<q>do you forget that your house
was so tightly closed no one dared
knock at the door? I even hesitated
to visit you, and yet you cannot
doubt my affection for you.
Why, then, should others have been
bolder?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh!</q> said Ragaud, <q>any one
that wished could easily have found
his way in. You had no difficulty,
dear monsieur.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That I grant, but I was in the
country. Do you know how many
of your best friends are here yet?
In the first place, the whole of the
château are in Paris.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I know it,</q> said Jeanne.
<q>My godmother did not bid me
good-by.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She was very sick, my daughter;
you must not ill-judge her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And Michou?</q> asked Ragaud.
</p>

<p>
<q>Michou was at Mass, directly
behind you,</q> said the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>; <q>and
if he did not show himself, it was
from delicacy; but he is not far off,
and will come at the first signal.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And Solange?</q> asked Jeanne,
in such a low tone she scarcely
could be heard. That was the
name the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign> was waiting for. He
looked at Jeanne in a serious manner.
</p>

<p>
<q>Solange,</q> said he, <q>left also on
that unfortunate day, and knew
nothing of it. She, Jeanne Ragaud,
was your most faithful friend, and
is so still. You have calumniated
her, my daughter. I know it; but
I hope you have sincerely repented;
above all, when you hear that she
is now at the novitiate of the Sisters
of Charity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! is it possible?</q> cried she,
clasping her hands. <q>Dear Solange!
how unjust I have been to
her!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you not been unjust to
others also, my child?</q> asked the
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign> with gentleness. <q>Confess it,
Jeannette; you should do so from a
sense of justice.</q>
</p>

<p>
Jeannette hid her face in her
hands, and burst into tears. The
question had pierced her soul.
</p>

<p>
<q>M. le Curé,</q> said Pierrette,
<q>I know of whom you wish to
speak; but he, I believe, has not
left the country, and his conduct,
therefore, is scarcely excusable.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ask your daughter,</q> replied the
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>; <q>she, undoubtedly, can answer
that question.</q>
</p>

<p>
And as Jeannette could not
speak on account of her tears, he
continued:
</p>

<p>
<q>What could he do, poor boy!
but disappear when the only roof
that could shelter him refused to
receive him. He is no longer here,
Mme. Ragaud, that child who loved
you so dearly, and who had proved
it so well. An inconsiderate word
has driven him from your arms,
and, having no other resource in
this world, he is going to become a
soldier, doubtless in the hope of
dying honorably in fighting for his
country.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Never did I drive off Jean-Louis,
monsieur,</q> said good Pierrette;
<q>no, never, I can truly
swear.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nor I,</q> said Ragaud; <q>and at
this very moment I am ready to
redeem him from the conscription.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>However, he is gone,</q> replied
the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>; <q>and he, like Solange,
did not know you were in trouble.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh!</q> cried Jeanne, falling on
her knees, <q>I did it all. Heaven
has justly punished me. Tell
me where he is, M. le Curé; he will
not refuse to pardon me, I am so
unhappy.</q>
</p>

<pb n='050'/><anchor id='Pg050'/>

<p>
<q>What did you do?</q> asked Pierrette.
<q>Alas! all this worry has
turned the poor child's head. Of
what do you wish to accuse yourself,
my daughter?</q>
</p>

<p>
Old Ragaud, who was not easily
moved, approached the little thing
and placed his hand on her head.
He was very much affected to see
her thus, kneeling and weeping, in
the posture of a guilty person. He
looked at M. le Curé, who looked
at Jeannette, and Pierrette looked
at all three.
</p>

<p>
Then that young girl did something
very touching and unusual.
She wiped her eyes, and, without
rising, commenced in a sweet, low
voice the true confession of all her
past conduct, not sparing herself,
as was right and just, and yet
neither showing excitement nor
too great bitterness against herself,
which was the mark of sincere repentance.
As she spoke, her face
regained its color, and her eyes
shone with holy joy; for the Lord,
who saw her laudable intention, rewarded
her with great interior relief
for doing what for many others
would have been the greatest mortification.
When she had finished,
she remained with her hands clasped,
and her head bent low, before
her parents and M. le Curé; but no
person broke the silence. Of the
three witnesses of this affecting
scene, two wept behind their handkerchiefs,
and the third, wishing
to preserve his gravity as pastor,
was too much moved to articulate
a word.
</p>

<p>
<q>Father,</q> continued Jeannette
in the same humble and firm tone,
<q>judge me, now that you know how
guilty I am. It is to you I speak,
in presence of my mother and M.
le Curé, and I am ready to submit
to whatever punishment you may
inflict upon me. I have deprived
you of a son who made you happy,
that you might keep a daughter
who has only drawn misery and
sorrow on your house. But that
daughter is still capable of loving
you; let her remain with you, that
she may make reparation for her
sins. I know I do not deserve it,</q>
added she after a moment's silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>My daughter,</q> said M. le Curé,
<q>you have done well. Rise; the
good God pardons you, and your
parents also, very certainly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O my poor darling! most
surely,</q> said Pierrette, pressing her
child to her breast.
</p>

<p>
<q>And you, Ragaud, will you not
embrace your daughter?</q> asked M.
le Curé.
</p>

<p>
The good farmer, you may well
think, had no desire to be severe.
He kissed Jeannette with great
tenderness, and made her sit down
by him. But his heart was much
troubled; now that he understood
his injustice towards Jean-Louis,
and his rash judgment, and remembering
how easy it would have
been for him to have prevented his
departure by speaking a friendly
word at the right time, he reproached
himself as bitterly as Jeannette
had done; and if his paternal dignity
had not prevented him from
humiliating himself before his child,
he would have been tempted to
confess in his turn.
</p>

<p>
<q>M. le Curé,</q> said he, <q>if God
one day will let us know where
Jean-Louis is, do you think he
would consent to return?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hem!</q> said the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>, <q>he is
proud; that remains to be seen....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! I would beg him so hard,</q>
replied Jeanne.
</p>

<p>
<q>In the first place, my child, we
must put our hands on him; and
there is the difficulty. Jeannet is
not a boy to change his resolution
like a weathercock that turns to
<pb n='051'/><anchor id='Pg051'/>
every wind. And if he has enlisted,
you will have to run after his
regiment.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Poor child!</q> said Ragaud, <q>he
don't know that he has a little fortune
stowed away in a safe place,
and that it increases every year.
If it should cost three thousand
francs, I will redeem him, no matter
where, no matter when.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Father,</q> said Jeanne, <q>before
leaving M. le Curé, let me ask you
one favor in his presence.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Speak, my child, I promise it
to you in advance,</q> answered the
good man.
</p>

<p>
<q>That you will never speak to me
of marriage,</q> replied the little thing
in a firm voice, <q>and that you will
let me assist my mother in all her
labors in the fields.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And when mademoiselle comes
back?</q> asked the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>, with a spice
of mischief.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! I understand too well that
my place is no longer at the château;
all our troubles have come
from my having lived there too
long,</q> said she.
</p>

<p>
<q>Jeanne Ragaud,</q> said M. le
Curé, <q>always think so, and conform
your conduct to your words;
and if you will persevere in your
resolution, in the name of the
Lord I promise you that these
trials will pass, and that you will
yet have many happy days.</q>
</p>

<p>
M. le Curé pronounced these
words in such a serious tone they
all three felt wonderfully comforted.
We can truly say that this
Sunday was one of the happiest
days in the life of the Ragauds.
They went back to Muiceron with
courage and peace in their souls,
and on the next day each one set
to work to repair the damage that
two weeks of discouragement and
gloom had introduced into that
poor forlorn house.
</p>

<p>
The days passed rapidly between
work and household duties
faithfully accomplished. Gradually
the remembrance of the recent
misfortunes lost its bitterness, and
they were even able to speak of
them sometimes to Jacques Michou,
who came frequently to visit
his friends. As the police sought
in vain for Isidore, people ended
by letting him drop; and, as always
happens, each one having resumed
his usual course of affairs, they came
to the conclusion that perhaps he
was not so guilty as had seemed at
first sight; so that, but for their
ignorance as to the fate of Jean-Louis,
one month after the catastrophe
the Ragauds appeared as
happy and tranquil as before.
</p>

<p>
M. le Curé was not so ignorant,
being kept fully informed by Jean-Louis,
who wrote to him regularly,
but left to his wisdom to
confide what he chose to the family
at Muiceron. He preferred to
keep a strict silence, for the very
good reason that he wished to
prove, by a long trial, the sincerity
of Jeannette's conversion. Thank
God! on that side there was nothing
to apprehend. Solange, with
her great charity of soul, had not
been mistaken in thinking Jeannette's
head weaker than her heart.
</p>

<p>
Misfortune had so purified and
strengthened the little creature,
Jean-Louis would have loved her
more than ever, could he have seen
her thus changed; for although
nothing is perfect in this world, I
can truly say, without exaggeration,
she was now as near perfection as
could be expected of anything
human.
</p>

<p>
Pierrette, who at first wished to
spare her little hands, so unaccustomed
to work, did not wish her to
undertake any of the heavier labor;
but Jeannette was so quick and
<pb n='052'/><anchor id='Pg052'/>
ready, the hardest and most difficult
tasks were always accomplished
by the time her mother
came to give directions. She was
the first at the stables in the morning,
which she never left until all
was in order, the fresh milk placed
aside, and the cream taken off that
of the evening before; on churning
days she prepared the wheels of
the machine, which would afterwards
be turned by Marion. It
was she also who measured the
ashes for the lye used in the big
wash the fifteenth of every month;
and every week gave out the flour,
half wheat, half rye, for the family
bread. So great was her zeal she
even wished to knead the dough,
and put the loaves in the oven,
which is terribly hard work; but
this time Pierrette showed her authority,
and declared she would
sooner give up baking at home
than see her daughter wear herself
out at the kneading-trough like a
baker's son-in-law.
</p>

<p>
From time to time, M. le Curé
visited Muiceron at unusual hours,
so that his appearance would be
entirely unexpected, and always
found Jeannette busy with her
household labors, or, if it was late
in the day, seated by the window,
mending the clothes and linen of
the family.
</p>

<p>
Her dress was always very simple,
even on Sunday, and you may
well think that mademoiselle's
beautiful dresses were left hanging
in the closet without being even
looked at occasionally. For another
girl it would have been advisable
economy to make some use
of them by altering the style, so as
to fit them for the farm; but Jeannette
was too rich for any one to
accuse her of extravagance for not
using them, and it was every way
better she should not reappear in
costumes that would recall a time
which, although passed, still left a
painful memory.
</p>

<p>
She generally wore a serge skirt,
striped in black and white, with a
woollen basque which corresponded;
and her Indian neckerchief from
Rouen, covered with little bouquets
of bright flowers, crossed in
front, under her apron, was in no
way more pretentious or coquettish
than that of her mother Pierrette.
</p>

<p>
She even wore the cap of our
country-girls, which consists of a
head-piece of linen, with long ends
of lawn, which they cross above the
head on the days they wish to appear
very fine. Coquettes know
how to make themselves very elegant
by adding embroidery and
lace; but Jeanne Ragaud, who
could have bought out a mercer's
shop, thought no longer of beautifying
herself, much less her cap.
Thus dressed, she looked more like
a quiet little outdoor sister of
some convent than the sole heiress
of a large estate. She was told so
sometimes, which highly delighted
her, as she wished to appear in
everything totally different from
what she had been.
</p>

<p>
It needed a little courage to act
thus before the eyes of the whole
commune. Jeannette knew that
after being called for ten years the
vainest, silliest little peacock in the
country, she was now looked upon
as an exaggerated devotee; and,
what was worse, some said she had
thrown herself into the arms of the
good God because her marriage
had been broken off.
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait and see,</q> said the busy
tongues; <q>only let her dear Perdreau
come back, and all the fine
dresses will be taken from the
hooks, as before his departure.</q>
</p>

<p>
For they were persuaded she
<pb n='053'/><anchor id='Pg053'/>
adored him, and that she still preserved,
in the bottom of her heart,
a tender remembrance, mingled
with regret, which only waited an
opportunity to show itself. Now,
one's nature is not changed, no
matter how great is the desire to
correct it, and you know that Jeannette
was passionate and excitable.
She therefore had much to suffer,
and did suffer in silence, thinking
that all these mortifications would
aid her to expiate her sins, and to
merit from the good God the favor
of Jean-Louis' return, which now
was the sole object of all her
thoughts, desires, and prayers.
</p>

<p>
To see again the friend of her
childhood; to soothe together the
declining years of her old parents;
to converse with him as in old
times; to resume the gentle friendship,
which now was so ardently
desired by her poor little heart; to
ask his pardon; and to make him so
happy that he would forget the past&mdash;this
was what this repentant, loving
child thought of by day, and
dreamt of all night, waking or sleeping.
As her conversion had not
deprived her of penetration, she
quickly guessed that the good <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign>
knew every movement of Jean-Louis
from A to Z; and it was
amusing to see the way in which
she would turn and turn again her
questions, in the most innocent
manner, so as to obtain some enlightenment
on the subject. But
our <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign> read this young soul like
an open book, and, although he admired
all that the Lord was working
in it for her good, pursued the
trial, and, under the manner of an
old grandfather, kind-hearted and
tender, did not allow her to gain
from him one foot of ground.
However, occasionally he pretended
to be surprised, taken by storm.
It was when he would see the little
thing sadder than usual, and ready
to be discouraged. Then he would
loose the string two or three inches&mdash;that
is to say, he would say a word
here and there, to make it appear
he would speak openly at his next
visit; and when that day came, he
played the part of a person very
much astonished that anything was
expected from him.
</p>

<p>
However, like everything else, this
had to come to an end. Half
through pity, half through wisdom,
the dear <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>curé</foreign> thought&mdash;as he said
himself&mdash;that if the bow was too
much bent, it would break; so one
morning, having finished his Mass
and eaten his frugal breakfast, he
went to Muiceron, with the intention
of conversing seriously with
the Ragauds, and telling them all
that he knew of good Jean-Louis.
</p>

<head>Home Rule For Ireland.</head>

<p>
The term Home Rule as applied
to British politics, in its local signification,
has been a very unfamiliar
one to American readers until
quite recently, and even yet it
is not generally recognized as the
watch-word of a powerful and growing
political party in and outside of
the English Parliament, which has its
headquarters in Ireland, and numerous
ramifications extending throughout
the principal cities and towns
of England, Wales, and Scotland.
In its leading features and designs
this new organization may be said
to be in fact the revival by another
generation of the one formerly
founded and led by O'Connell, and,
like its prototype, is established for
the purpose of effecting by constitutional
means the abrogation of
the treaty of union between Great
Britain and Ireland, which was so
delusively concocted and ratified,
in the name of those countries, at
the close of the last century; and
the consequent reconstruction of
the Irish Parliament on a footing
of equality with that of England.
</p>

<p>
It is by no means what might be
called a revolutionary movement,
for it seeks neither to pull down
nor destroy, by force or conspiracy,
those bulwarks which society has
raised for its own protection against
lawless and unscrupulous demagogues;
its object is simply to restore,
as far as desirable and practicable,
the old order of things, and to
redress, even at this late day, an act
of flagrant wrong and injustice
done three-quarters of a century
ago to a long misgoverned people,
by restoring to them the right and
power to regulate their own domestic
affairs, subject, of course, to the
authority of the common sovereign
of the United Kingdoms.
</p>

<p>
The history of the treaty and
acts of legislative union between
Great Britain and Ireland, and of
the motives which conduced to the
formation of the conspiracy against
the independence of an entire nation;
of the plots formed in the
fertile brain of Mr. Pitt against the
civil and religious liberties of the
sister kingdom, and but too successfully
carried out by Castlereagh,
Cooke, and other officials in Dublin,
has never been sufficiently studied,
even in this country, where every
measure affecting the freedom of
mankind, in what part of Christendom
soever, possesses peculiar interest.
This defective knowledge
of a subject comparatively modern
may be attributed partly to the fact
that we Americans have been too
much in the habit of looking at
foreign politics through English
spectacles, and in part because
there seems to be a principle in
human nature which inclines us to
ignore, if not despise, the sufferings
of the needy and unfortunate.
Vanquished nations are regarded
generally as are poor relations
whom no one cares to know or acknowledge.
</p>

<p>
And yet the circumstances which
eventually led to the destruction of
the Irish Parliament were almost
contemporary with, and to a certain
degree grew out of, our own Revolution.
The causes that effected the
severance of the North American
colonies from the mother country,
<pb n='055'/><anchor id='Pg055'/>
and facilitated the consummation of
our aspirations for independence,
operated, paradoxical as it may
seem, to bind Ireland firmer in the
chains of alien thraldom, as well as
to extinguish the last spark of her
freedom.
</p>

<p>
It is generally conceded that the
Irish Parliament, from its inception
in the XIVth century till 1782, was
not only not the legitimate legislative
representative of even a moiety
of the people of that country, but
was actually a very efficient instrument
in the hands of their enemies.
At first it was merely an irregular
gathering of the nobles and chief
men of the <q>Pale</q>&mdash;a term applied
for hundreds of years after the invasion
to four or five counties on
the eastern and southeastern sea-board,
over which the Anglo-Normans
held sway. Whenever a raid
on the native chieftains was projected,
or a scheme of spoliation to be
adopted, it had long been the
custom of the lord deputy, or other
representative of English authority,
to summon the heads of Anglo-Irish
houses and a few of the principal
burghers of the larger towns
and cities within his jurisdiction,
to meet him at Dublin, Drogheda,
or Kilkenny, and, having given
the motley gathering the sonorous
title of parliament, to demand the
enactment of new statutes against
the <q>Irish enemy,</q> or to extort
fresh levies of men and money for
his incursions into the interior.
</p>

<p>
Gradually, however, those erratic
assemblies began to assume form
and regularity, and even to display
a certain independence of action
distasteful to the governing power.
As English conquest in Ireland
gradually widened its sphere, particularly
in Leinster and Munster,
the number of members who attended
those sessions increased; and
as the descendants of the invaders,
having lost the attachment of their
forefathers to England, naturally
evinced a desire to legislate for
themselves, it was thought desirable
in London to nip in the bud
a flower which might insensibly
expand into national independence.
Accordingly, in the reign of the
seventh Henry, the Irish Parliament
being still weak and yielding,
a bill was passed by it acknowledging
the dependence of that body
on the king of England and his
council. This act, called after its
originator, Poynings, most effectually
repressed the aspirations of the
only representative body in the
kingdom, and produced the desired
results. But as if this were not
enough, we find subsequently, in
the reign of William and Mary especially,
instances of the English
Parliament legislating directly for
Ireland; and in the sixth of George
I. there was passed a declaratory act
which, if any vestiges of freedom or
manhood yet remained in the Irish
Parliament, most effectually destroyed
them. These efforts, thus
made from time to time to destroy
the liberty and efficiency of the
Parliament, naturally disgusted a
great many of its members who had
the least spark of self-respect or
personal honor left, and drove them
from the nation's councils; those
who remained being almost without
exception government officials or
newly-arrived and needy adventurers,
ignorant of the character,
wants, and wishes of the people,
who hoped, by the display of extraordinary
zeal and sycophancy, to
push their fortunes and find favor
in the eyes of the Castle authorities.
It is not surprising, then, that a
body composed of such elements
should have unhesitatingly voted
away the royalty of the ancient
<pb n='056'/><anchor id='Pg056'/>
kingdom to Henry VIII., whose
predecessors never claimed a higher
title than that of lord; that at
the bidding of the same monster, it
officially and almost unanimously
declared for the Reformation, and
with equal alacrity, in the reign of
his daughter Mary, explicitly repudiated
everything it had done a
few years previously.
</p>

<p>
Yet it still bore the semblance of
a national legislature; and, gradually
yielding to the influence of a
growing public opinion, some good
men, Catholics as well as Protestants,
were again to be found
among its members in the subsequent
reigns, until that of William
III., when, by an unconstitutional
law of the English Parliament, the
former were for ever excluded, and
never during its existence was one
of that proscribed faith allowed to
sit on its benches. From this reign
also may be dated the many cruel
penal enactments, over one hundred
in number, which disgraced
its statute-books; though, to do its
members justice, they never went so
far in ferocity and ingenuity as did
their brethren of London at the
same period and even long previously.
</p>

<p>
But though four-fifths of the people
were disfranchised and their co-religionists
denied a seat in the Parliament,
that body was again gradually
approaching the assertion of
its right of self-legislation. A new
generation had sprung up during
the later half of the XVIIIth century
who knew not William of
Orange nor the bitter anti-Irish
prejudices that characterized his
followers. The bold, incisive, and
satirical writings of Swift, the
learned disquisitions of Molyneux,
and the homely but vigorous appeals
of Lucas, had not been without
their effect on the young students
of Trinity and other colleges,
fresh from the study of the lessons
of human liberty so frequently
found in classic lore; and the consequence
was that when they entered
the Parliament as members, confident
in their position as gentlemen
of fortune, and self-reliant, not
only from their aristocratic connections,
but from their innate sense
of mental superiority, language began
to be heard and applauded
which, for elegance, grace, and manliness,
had never been equalled in
that hall before. The outbreak of
our Revolution, the broad principles
of justice and humanity laid down
in the speeches and writings of our
ancestors, and the trumpet-toned
Declaration of Independence occurring
at the same time, gave an
impetus and a clarity of ideas on
questions of government which, up
to that time, had assumed neither
form nor consistency.
</p>

<p>
The first symptoms of active agitation
for their political rights may
be said to have sprung up at this
period among the Irish of all conditions
and creeds, but more especially
in Ulster and the cities of
Dublin, Cork, and Limerick&mdash;the
homes of manufactures and the centres
of produce, exports, etc. Their
grievances were of two classes: restriction
on foreign trade, and parliamentary
dependence and corruption.
Under the first head, it was
charged, and with great truth, that
Irish merchants were prohibited by
English laws from trading with
France, Spain, Portugal, Holland,
many of the West India Islands,
and the whole of Asia, for the purpose
of benefiting their rivals in
England; thus utterly crippling the
manufacturing interests of the
country, and completely stopping
the exportation to these markets of
farm products, of which she had
<pb n='057'/><anchor id='Pg057'/>
even then a superabundant supply.
This limitation of commerce had
long been not only the principal
cause of the impoverishment of the
nation, but a fruitful source of clamor
and popular discontent, which
had invariably been unheeded by
the dominant power as long as it
was able to repress them by the
strong arm. At length, however, a
change was about to take place.
Soon after our War of Independence
broke out and the French alliance
was cemented, England was obliged
to withdraw from Ireland nearly
the whole of her military and naval
forces, thus leaving the latter undefended
by either regulars or militia,
and at any moment open to attack
from the allies. Indeed, Paul
Jones several times appeared on
the coast, and in 1779-80 the Franco-Spanish
fleets were absolute
masters of the Channel. The people,
kept in a constant state of
alarm, at last determined to arm
for mutual protection; and thus was
originated that short-lived but remarkable
body of citizen soldiery
known as the Irish Volunteers.
</p>

<p>
The movement began in Belfast
in August, 1778, and before two years
elapsed it had spread over the
whole country, and counted on its
muster-rolls nearly one hundred
thousand men, fully armed and
equipped at their own expense.
Noblemen, judges, magistrates, and
prominent members of Parliament
were proud to serve in the Volunteers
as company or field officers;
and Lord Charlemont, one of the
most accomplished and liberal
members of his order, accepted the
office of commander-in-chief.
</p>

<p>
The external security of the island
having thus been amply provided
for, attention was naturally
turned to internal evils. Various
meetings of Volunteers were held
in the several counties, and strong
resolutions passed in favor of the
freedom of foreign trade. The
Castle authorities were not in a
position to resist a demand so
made; the Irish Parliament, led by
such men as Grattan, Flood, and
other nationalists, voted in favor of
the immediate emancipation of commerce;
and the British premier,
Lord North, in December, 1779, submitted
three propositions to the
English Parliament to permit the
export of glass and woollens from
Ireland, and permission for her to
trade with the American colonies,
Africa, and the West Indies. During
the following February, a bill
embodying these provisions was
introduced by the ministry, and
passed with little opposition.
</p>

<p>
This point gained, the Volunteers
set to work to free the Irish Parliament
itself from all dependence
on the London Privy Council and
the Parliament of the sister kingdom.
In April, 1780, Grattan moved
his Declaration of Rights, which
avowed, among other truths, <q>that
his most excellent majesty, by and
with the consent of the lords and
commons of Ireland, are the only
power competent to enact the laws
to bind Ireland.</q> This resolution
was, however, opposed on technical
grounds, and withdrawn. During
the following year, Mr. Yelverton
asked leave to bring in a bill virtually
repealing Poynings' law, which
was granted by a vote of 167 against
37, though later in the session
Flood's motion of a similar purport
was defeated by a majority of 72.
The people, who had anxiously
watched the action of their representatives,
were now in a ferment
of excitement, and numerous meetings
of civilians and Volunteers were
held throughout the provinces, the
most noteworthy of which was the
<pb n='058'/><anchor id='Pg058'/>
convention of the Ulster Volunteers
at Dungannon, February 15, 1782.
This powerful assembly passed a
series of manly resolutions in favor
of the right of the subject to bear
arms, to express his opinions freely
on political affairs, and to worship
God according to the dictates of his
conscience; but the one most to
the point read as follows: <q><hi rend='italic'>Resolved</hi>,
unanimously, That a claim
of any body of men other than the
king, lords, and commons of Ireland
to make laws to bind this kingdom
is unconstitutional, illegal, and a
grievance.</q> This was followed up
by like meetings in the other sections
of the country, at which similar
resolutions were adopted. A
few days after there was a change
of ministry in England, and of
course a change of policy. Messages
were sent in the name of the
king to both Parliaments, ordering
them to take into their most serious
consideration <q>the discontents and
jealousies prevailing among his loyal
subjects of Ireland, in order to such
a final adjustment as may give mutual
satisfaction to both kingdoms.</q>
The answer of the Irish Parliament
to this demand met with no opposition
on the question of its adoption,
though it declared emphatically
<q>that there is no body of men
competent to make laws to bind
this nation except the king, lords,
and commons of Ireland; nor any
other parliament which hath any
authority or power of any sort
whatever in this country save only
the Parliament of Ireland.</q> There
was no mistaking or avoiding this
expression of public opinion, endorsed
as it had been by a national
army able and willing to second
their demands; so in May, 1782, the
act of sixth George I. was repealed
in the English Parliament, and the
old objectionable law of Poynings
simultaneously suffered a similar
fate in that of Ireland.
</p>

<p>
Irish trade was now free, and
Irish legislation independent at
least of alien dictation; but another
great task lay before the Volunteers,
which unless accomplished, their
well-won victories were likely to
prove barren indeed. This was the
purification of their own House of
Commons, and the right of representation
for the people at large.
That the popular branch of the
legislature wanted reformation badly
may be judged from the <emph>status</emph> of
its members as given by contemporary
writers. Only seventy-two of
them were returned by vote; one
hundred and thirty-three sat for
<q>nomination</q> or <q>close</q> boroughs,
absolutely controlled by a
few peers; ninety-five were similarly
sent to the Parliament by
about fifty commoners; so that,
out of the three hundred members
of the house, two hundred and
twenty-eight were wholly and solely
dependent for their seats on less
than half their own number. When
we consider, also, that of those creatures
at least one-half were officials,
pensioners, or expectants of pensions
and government favors, we
can well imagine how little reliance
could be placed on their integrity
or honesty in a struggle between a
hostile, inimical power and the people;
and it must also be remembered
that at that time neither the
right of representation nor of suffrage
was allowed to the Catholics,
who comprised seventy or eighty
per cent. of the entire population.
</p>

<p>
The Volunteers, therefore, set to
work to do for their countrymen
what fifty years afterwards was at
least partially effected by the Emancipation
and Reform Acts for the
United Kingdoms. They again held
meetings, passed resolutions, and
<pb n='059'/><anchor id='Pg059'/>
even called a national convention
to meet in Dublin during the Parliamentary
session of 1783-4. One
hundred and sixty delegates accordingly
met in the Rotunda amid
the general congratulations of the
citizens and the high hopes of the
nation. But, alas! this sanguine
confidence in the manliness and
liberality of the delegates soon received
a shock so rude that its effects
were felt in the most remote parts
of the island, and carried with them
gloom and dismay to the masses of
the people.
</p>

<p>
The Volunteers were an essentially,
and it might be said an exclusively,
Protestant organization
from the beginning, but it was earnestly
supported by the Catholics
from a feeling that unrestricted
trade and legislative independence
were national boons of the first importance,
as well as from an apparently
well-founded trust that,
these being obtained, the abrogation
of the penal laws and the right of
representation would speedily follow.
They could not believe that
an influential but very small minority,
seeking liberty for themselves,
would persistently deny it to the
large majority of their countrymen.
They were now about to be undeceived.
One of the very first resolutions
passed at the convention read
as follows: <q><hi rend='italic'>Resolved</hi>, That the <hi rend='italic'>Protestant</hi>
inhabitants of this country
are required by the statute law to
carry arms and to learn the use of
them,</q> etc.; and, lest any doubt
should remain of the bigotry and
narrow-mindedness which pervaded
the representatives of the Volunteers,
the plan of reform, as drawn
up by Flood and subsequently
adopted, was made to read thus:
<q>That every <hi rend='italic'>Protestant</hi> freeholder
or leaseholder, possessing a freehold
or leasehold for a certain term
of years of forty shillings' value,
resident in any city or borough,
should be entitled to vote at the
election of a member for the same.</q>
</p>

<p>
The limitation of the right to
bear arms and to vote to Protestants
only was the destruction of the moral
as well as physical power of the
Volunteers, and a death-blow to the
longings and aspirations of the patriotic
Catholics. It was more than
a blunder, it was a crime&mdash;a piece
of rank, selfish hypocrisy, which ill
became men who had the words of
freemen on their lips, but, it appears,
the feelings of tyrants in their hearts.
In vain did the Irish Catholics protest
in a series of resolutions; in
vain did the Earl of Bristol, then
Protestant Bishop of Derry, vehemently
advocate the claims of the
people to something like religious
and social equality. The convention
was deaf to all remonstrance
and entreaty, and blindly rushed to
its own destruction.
</p>

<p>
It had taken the only step that
could have gratified its enemies,
and, by throwing away the friendship
and support of the vast majority
of the population, it left itself
exposed and naked to the attacks
and machinations of the Castle authorities.
Pending the American
war, England looked with fear and
anxiety on that large body of armed
men that could at any time, and
with little risk, sever the connection
between the two countries, for she
was powerless to resist them; yet,
when somewhat recovered from her
humiliating defeats in her quondam
colonies, she turned all her attention
and used all her art to destroy
not only the Volunteers, but the
Parliament that had recognized and
fostered them. She was determined,
if possible, that such a dreaded contingency
should not occur again.
The convention, as we have seen,
<pb n='060'/><anchor id='Pg060'/>
had rejected the moderate demands
of the Catholics, many of whom,
despairing of justice in that quarter,
naturally looked to the government
for some modification of their disabilities;
while the Parliament, always
under official control, took
advantage of the occasion to sow
division and discord among its
members. When Flood, fresh from
the Rotunda, moved for leave to
bring in a reform bill embodying
the plans of the convention, it was
refused by a majority of eighty in
a total vote of two hundred and
thirty-four.
</p>

<p>
The history of Ireland from this
time till the close of the century
could well be blotted out, for the
sake of human nature, from the annals
of the race. The Volunteers,
who ought not only to have been
the defenders of the country from
foreign enemies, but the protectors
of the civil rights of their countrymen
at home, after the scornful rejection
of their claims by Parliament
and the adjournment of their
convention, ceased to be either
feared or respected. Many of their
most prominent officers went over
to the government, others of more
advanced views joined the secret
society known as the United Irishmen.
The English authorities, having
thus succeeded in their first project
even beyond their expectations,
applied themselves with extraordinary
industry to carry out the
second. Agrarian outrages became
more frequent; <q>Peep-o'-day boys</q>
and <q>Defenders</q> terrified the
peaceful farmers of one or other
side; Orangemen were petted and
armed, while Catholic bishops and
priests were deluded with false promises;
the royal grant to Maynooth
College was increased at the same
time that martial law was proclaimed
in the most peaceful Catholic districts;
and churches were being
burned to the ground unrestrictedly
by those who wore the king's livery.
At the general election, which took
place in 1790, the most scandalous
means were adopted to secure a
thoroughly subservient majority in
the lower house; and, lest this
should not be sufficient, new peers
were created through corrupt influence,
in order that the lords might
not offer any opposition to the behests
of the Castle.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to imagine the
scenes of outrage, rapine, private
revenge, and general consternation
which grew out of a persistence in
so wily and nefarious a policy. Supported
secretly by the authorities,
the Orangemen became utterly regardless
of the lives of their Catholic
neighbors; while they, with a
choice only between the oppression
of an armed faction of bigots on
one side, and the tender mercies of
English law on the other, naturally
inclined to the latter as the lesser
of two evils, and began to long for
imperial protection. There were
many, however, who joined the
United Irishmen, and here again
arose another division. That society
was a sworn secret organization,
and, as such, the hierarchy and
the priesthood were bound to condemn
it, no matter how much they
may have sympathized with its aims,
and to denounce all who were in its
ranks.
</p>

<p>
But notwithstanding the state of
fear, confusion, and disruption to
which the country was reduced, the
English officials still feared to bring
before the Parliament the question
of a union. A blow must first be
struck that would drive terror into
the hearts of the whole people; so
terrible and sanguinary that even
the greatest lover of his country's
independence would, it was hoped,
<pb n='061'/><anchor id='Pg061'/>
gladly desire peace and order, even
at the price of British connection.
This was done in 1798. The United
Irishmen proposed to resort to
armed insurrection and an appeal
for French support, but as yet had
committed no overt act of treason.
The government, which had all
along been cognizant of their
schemes and movements, resolved
to anticipate them by driving the
country into premature rebellion;
its tactics differing, however, in various
localities. To Wexford, always
a very peaceful, Catholic county,
where there were very few United
Irishmen, they sent the infamous
North Cork militia, whose cruelty
was only surpassed by their abject
cowardice. These miscreants were
to a man Orangemen, and their line
of march to the town of Wexford,
for miles on both sides, was marked
by the ruins of burned chapels and
the corpses of slaughtered peasantry.
It was only then that the people
of that country rose up in arms,
seeking <q>the wild justice of revenge,</q>
and waged on the murdrous
brood a war which, for bravery
and decisiveness during the
time it lasted, has few parallels in
modern history. In Dublin, the
chiefs of the intended insurrection
were suddenly seized, imprisoned,
and many of them finally executed.
The Presbyterians of Ulster, the
originators of the United system,
were hurried into untimely outbreaks
by the knowledge of the
discovery of their designs, and, after
three or four detached efforts at
rebellion, were easily put down by
the militia and regular troops.
Then came the judicial murders,
drum-head courts-martial, torture
and death. No man, no matter
how innocent, considered himself
safe, and no woman was free from
insult and outrage. The spirit of
the government seemed to be infused
into all its officials from the
highest judge on the bench to the
lowest constable, and that spirit was
one of terrorism and slaughter.
</p>

<p>
Ireland was now prostrate, defenceless,
and bleeding from every
artery and vein, and this was considered
a fitting time to rob her of
her Parliament, and snatch from her
enervated grasp the last remnant of
her independence. The measure
was introduced into both Parliaments
almost simultaneously, at first
with doubtful success, but afterwards
carried with little difficulty,
except the expenditure of enormous
sums by the government in bribing
and pensioning members. The
most alluring prospects were held
out to the Catholics to induce them
to support the measure out of Parliament&mdash;they
had no voice inside
of it&mdash;but, to their credit be it said,
not even a moiety of them were
deceived by such treacherous proposals.
They were assured that,
after the union, English capital
would flow free as water into the
country; that protection for their
persons and property against Orange
fanatics would be fully guaranteed;
and that many of the more oppressive
clauses in the penal code would
be repealed&mdash;all of which, it is unnecessary
to say, were conveniently
forgotten by Pitt and his successors
once the abominable bargain had
been closed. The act of union
passed the Irish House of Commons
June 7, 1800, and the House of
Lords on the 13th of the same
month, to take effect on the 1st of
January following.
</p>

<p>
The deed was at last accomplished,
and Ireland, deceived, betrayed,
and dejected, sank down
into the lethargy of despair till
once more aroused to action by the
magnificent genius of the great agitator,
<pb n='062'/><anchor id='Pg062'/>
O'Connell. For a long time
he dared not hope or ask for a repeal
of the union, but confined
himself to the removal of Catholic
disabilities, as the operation of the
nefarious penal laws was elegantly
called; though occasionally, in his
more comprehensive speeches, he
alluded to the future possibility of
such a demand. Emancipation
gained, the Reform Bill carried, and
the tithe, poor law, and other questions
of minor importance more
or less satisfactorily disposed of,
O'Connell turned his serious attention
to the restoration of the Irish
Parliament.
</p>

<p>
He initiated the movement in
1840, but for some time with very
little appearance of making it in
any sense a national one. The
people were supine, and those who
should have been their leaders
rested content with comparative
religious equality and the friendship
of the Whigs, who, when in
power, were always generous of
petty offices to the poor relations
and dependants of those who could
influence elections in their favor.
But the great Liberator, though he
had nearly reached that term of
threescore and ten allotted as the
span of man's life, was still full of
vigor and determination. He travelled
through every part of Ireland,
arousing the dormant, reassuring
the timid, arguing with the disputatious,
and hurling his anathemas
against those who, from cowardice
or venality, refused to join in the
crusade against English influence in
Ireland. His success was more than
wonderful. The hierarchy unanimously
declared in favor of <q>repeal,</q>
the priesthood almost without
exception became his warmest
and most efficient supporters, and
of course the mass of the people,
always on the right side when properly
led, greeted him everywhere
with the wildest applause. Money
poured in from all sides to help
the national cause; not Ireland
and the British Islands alone contributing
their quota, but the continent
of Europe and the ever-generous
people of America lavishly
advanced funds for the purpose of
aiding the people in obtaining self-government.
</p>

<p>
Then came the year 1843&mdash;the
year of the monster meetings at
central and time-honored localities,
such as Mallow, Tara, Mullaghmast,
and Clontarf, where assembled
countless thousands of well-dressed,
well-conducted, and unarmed
peasantry, to listen to the voice of
their champion and his co-laborers,
and to demand in peaceful terms
the restoration of their filched legislative
rights.
</p>

<p>
The British government was decidedly
alarmed, and with good
cause. It tried to stem the torrent of
popular opinion by the most extravagant
distribution of patronage, by
landlord intimidation, the denunciations
of a venal press, and even
by intrigues at the court of Rome;
but all to no effect. Rendered
desperate, it even projected a general
massacre at Clontarf; but this
savage project was defeated by the
judicious conduct of the repeal
leaders. Next it evoked the terrors
of the law; for in Ireland, unlike
most free or partially free
countries, the law has actual terrors
for the good, but very little for
the wicked. O'Connell and eight
of his associates, including his son
John, three editors, and two Catholic
priests, were arrested, indicted
for <q>conspiracy,</q> tried, and all, on
the 30th of May, 1844, were sentenced
to imprisonment, with the exception
of F. Tierney, who had died
before the trial. The effect on the
<pb n='063'/><anchor id='Pg063'/>
country was the reverse of what
was expected. O'Connell's popularity,
if possible, increased, the repealers
became more numerous,
and several Protestant gentlemen
of fortune and influence, who had
hitherto held aloof, joined the association.
But when three months
had elapsed, and the decision of
the packed Dublin jury and the
rulings of the stipendiary English
judges were set aside by the
House of Lords, led by Brougham,
the enthusiasm of the people knew
no bounds.
</p>

<p>
These indeed were the halcyon
days of Ireland. Never were her
people so numerous, prosperous,
and contented, so full of thankfulness
for the present and hope in
the future. Of the nine millions
of her population, at least two-thirds
were active repealers or in
sympathy with their cause. No
nation, in fact, was ever more
unanimous on any public question
than were the Irish of the years
1844-5, and never was the country
so free from crime of every degree.
Much of this enviable condition
was to be attributed to the oft-repeated
admonition of O'Connell,
that <q>he who commits a crime gives
strength to the enemy</q>; more, perhaps,
to the unceasing admonitions
and personal presence of the priesthood
at the monster gatherings;
but most, we think, to the workings
of F. Mathew's beneficent projects.
It was a fortunate coincidence that
the Apostle of Temperance and
the great Liberator were contemporaries.
For the one teetotaler the
first could show, the other could
point out an ardent repealer.
</p>

<p>
But a change was impending that,
amid the sunshine and gladness of
the hour, was undreamt of&mdash;a change
that was to spread woe and desolation
over the face of the fair
island. Famine, gaunt and hideous
famine, with her attendants, pestilence
and death, was knocking at
the door, and would not be denied
admittance.
</p>

<p>
The first symptoms of the failure
of the potato crop, then almost exclusively
the food of five or six
millions of people, appeared as early
as 1845, and, though it created much
alarm and distress in certain neighborhoods,
was not of so widespread
a nature as to excite general anxiety
till the close of that year and the
beginning of the next. O'Connell,
the mayors and corporations of the
large cities, and many other prominent
persons, lay and clerical, having
exhausted all the resources of
private charity, strenuously but
vainly urged on the government
the necessity of taking some steps
to save the lives of the people.
They represented, and truly, that the
grain crop alone of the country was
sufficient to feed twice the number
of inhabitants, and asked that its
exportation might be prohibited;
that a large portion of the imperial
revenue was raised in Ireland, and
suggested that a portion of it might
be expended there on useful public
works, and thus afford employment
to the famishing and needy; that a
great part of the lands then unproductive
might be reclaimed with
benefit to the holders, and proposed
that the government ought to
loan money to the landlords for
that purpose, to bear interest, become
a first lien on the land, and
to be repaid at the expiration of a
certain number of years. Their
appeals were answered by coercion
and arms acts, and by the repeal
of the Corn Laws, by which the
Irish producer, who was obliged to
sell his cereals in English markets
in order to pay his rent, found himself
undersold by importers from
<pb n='064'/><anchor id='Pg064'/>
the great grain-producing countries,
like Russia and the United States.
In truth, England did not want to
stay the famine, for it was her best
and only ally against the repeal
movement; and the <q>providential
visitation,</q> as it was blasphemously
called by her politicians and clerical
demagogues, was allowed to take
its course. Thus unchecked, the
dire destroyer swept on from county
to county during the years 1846-7-8-9,
till the island, so fair to view
in 1844, became almost a deserted
graveyard, and its inhabitants who
had neither sunk beneath its curse
nor fled the country became a nation
of paupers. It is now proven
by trustworthy statistics that during
those five years over one million
fled for ever from their homes, and
that at least a million and a third
perished on their own soil, amid
plenty, from want of food and the
ravages of the fatal typhus!
</p>

<p>
No wonder, then, that the great
repeal organization drooped, quarrelled,
and finally ended a lingering
and impotent existence a few years
after. The bone and sinew of the
land, who had given vitality and
strength to its labors, were either
far across the Atlantic or rotting in
pauper-graves. No wonder, also,
that its great founder and chief,
overburdened with years, but more
by national misfortunes, should
have sickened at the sights around
him, and, fleeing from the ills he
could not cure, should have died
on a foreign soil, far from his beloved
fatherland.
</p>

<p>
But though the famine had mortally
wounded the repeal movement,
its demise was hastened by dissensions
among the leaders themselves.
In 1846, in a discussion on the expediency
of the use of moral force
solely as a means of obtaining national
redress of grievances, hot and
personal remarks fell from the lips
of the speakers on both sides; great
excitement was created among the
audience, and finally O'Brien and
many of the ablest and most active
of the repeal writers and speakers
withdrew, and formed what was
called the Confederation or <q>Young
Ireland</q> party. Though thoroughly
honest, high-toned, and brilliant as
orators and journalists, the Young
Irelanders could never win any appreciable
amount of popular support;
and though up to February,
1848, when the French Revolution
threw Europe into a ferment of excitement,
they never contemplated
armed resistance, the people generally
looked upon them with suspicion,
and refused their co-operation.
In the summer of that year, however,
they did make an attempt at revolution,
and, as might have been expected,
miserably failed. Thus the
<q>Association</q> and the <q>Confederation</q>
disappeared almost at the
same time; and now that a quarter
of a century has passed, and a new
generation has come to the front,
we find the principles and aims of
the original organization revivified
and incorporated into what is called
the <q>Home Rule League.</q>
</p>

<p>
In its demands, this association is
more moderate than was O'Connell.
He wanted repeal of the treaty and
act of union, pure and simple, and
the restoration of the national legislature
as it was in 1782, with the
emancipation and other kindred
acts superadded. The Home
Rulers, if we may judge from the
resolutions passed at a very large
conference held lately in Dublin,
only ask for a parliament to regulate
their domestic affairs, leaving
to the British imperial Parliament
full power and authority over all
matters concerning the entire empire,
or, in other words, placing Ireland
<pb n='065'/><anchor id='Pg065'/>
in the same position with regard
to the law-making power as
that now held by Canada, except
the right of Ireland to send a proportional
number of members to
the imperial assembly. The success
of such a scheme in Ireland
would naturally lead to the restoration
of the old Scotch Parliament,
and possibly to imperial representation
for Canada and other trans-marine
colonies of Great Britain.
Hence the widespread interest it
has excited throughout the empire.
</p>

<p>
The objections to the home-rule
plan, as far as we can gather them
from the English and Tory Irish
press&mdash;for the politicians have carefully
avoided its discussion&mdash;are
principally three:
</p>

<p>
I. The confusion and possible
conflict of authority which might
arise from having two co-ordinate
legislative assemblies under the
same government.
</p>

<p>
II. That the people of Ireland
are unable to govern themselves,
and, as the last Parliament was lost
by the corruption and venality of
its members, a restored one would
be open to the same deleterious influences.
</p>

<p>
III. That as the Catholics, from
their numbers, would necessarily
have a majority in the Commons,
the rights of property and the
guaranteed privileges of their Protestant
fellow-subjects would be in
danger.
</p>

<p>
IV. That the granting of legislative
power would be only a step to
complete independence.
</p>

<p>
To these objections it is answered,
first, that as the advocates of
home rule merely require power
to regulate affairs purely domestic,
and not touch on those within the
jurisdiction of an imperial Parliament,
there would be little possibility
of a collision of the two bodies;
secondly, they admit the premises,
but deny the conclusion regarding
the probability of bribery and corruption,
for the conditions are altered.
The rotten and presentation
boroughs, from whence the tools of
the Castle sprung, have been swept
away by the Reform Bill, and landlord
influence has received a decided
check by the adoption of the
ballot. They further allege that
the Catholics now, particularly
since the Encumbered Estates Act
was passed, are the most numerous
body of landholders in the kingdom,
and are consequently conservative,
and would be exceeding
jealous of any agrarian law that
might be proposed; that the late
Church Disestablishment and Land
Acts have done away with many of
the causes of quarrel between Catholics
and Protestants growing out
of tithes, endowments, etc.; and triumphantly
point to the numerous
Protestant gentlemen, many of
whom are clergymen, who have
joined their movement. As to the
idea of total separation, they very
properly retort that if Ireland will
not rest satisfied with the concession
of her just demands, it is not
likely that she will be more loyal to
the crown as long as they are withheld.
</p>

<p>
This repeal movement, in another
shape, like its predecessor, had a
very obscure birth and a small
christening. About three years ago,
a few gentlemen met in a private
room in the city of Dublin to chat
over political affairs, amongst whom
was Isaac Butt, a member of Parliament,
and a lawyer of large experience
and great eminence in his
profession, who suggested the outlines
of the present plan of operation.
Like most hardy plants, its
growth was at first slow, but it has
<pb n='066'/><anchor id='Pg066'/>
recently sprung up a hale, hearty
tree, with boughs overshadowing all
classes and creeds at home, and
roots extending through the sister
island and its dependencies. From
the first the leadership has been accorded
to Butt, who, though by no
means a man of the gigantic calibre
of O'Connell, is still a very competent
political guide and an energetic
organizer. Though a Protestant
and a great favorite with the more
liberal sectarians, he seems to enjoy
the confidence and friendship of
many of the Catholic bishops and
a large number of the priesthood,
particularly those of the venerable
Archbishop McHale, whose name
we find appended prominently to
the call for the late conference in the
capital. With Butt are such men as
Sir John Gray, Mr. Mitchell-Henry
Sullivan, Dease, Major O'Reilly,
Digby, Synan, Murphy, Blennerhassett,
the O'Connor Don, and other
prominent laymen; while the Catholic
clergy in great numbers, headed
by Dean O'Brien, of Limerick, are
active sympathizers. The Home
Rulers count in their ranks in Ireland
alone about sixty members
of Parliament, besides nearly half
that number representing English
constituencies. Sir Charles Gavan
Duffy, one of the most profound
and the best organizing minds that
Ireland has produced for many generations,
is, it is said, about to return
from Australia, and again enter the
British Parliament as the representative
of an Irish constituency. Duffy
is a Catholic, a man of varied and remarkable
experience in public affairs,
and would be a most valuable
acquisition to the nationalists in
council or Parliament.
</p>

<p>
The movement, as we have stated,
is not merely confined to Ireland.
It is nearly as popular and has almost
as many supporters in England
and Scotland; and in every
liberal newspaper published in those
countries that reaches us we find
reports of numerous meetings in
the principal towns and cities, and
even villages, of Great Britain. The
English Catholic press particularly
favor it, and this adds greatly to its
strength. A late number of the
London <hi rend='italic'>Tablet</hi> says in reference to
the home-rule conference: <q>We
can all know at present what is demanded
under the name of home
rule; and we may frankly say at
once that we have been agreeably
impressed by the moderation and
evident thoughtfulness which have
presided over the preparation and
adoption of the various resolutions
that embody the proposed home-rule
constitution. It is superfluous to say
that there is not a trace of revolution
about them.... What, however,
is not superfluous to say is that the
new programme of the Home Rulers
appears to us to have discarded
with discrimination almost everything
which could prejudice their
cause, and to have retained almost
everything calculated to render
their project acceptable to the British
public and imperial Parliament.</q>
</p>

<p>
The <hi rend='italic'>Weekly Register</hi>, on the same
subject, makes the following sensible
remarks:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
<q>From Tuesday to Friday, both inclusive,
hundreds of Irishmen from the north
and from the south, from the east and
from the west, Protestants and Catholics,
alumni of Maynooth and of Trinity College,
met in the Rotunda to discuss the
expediency of demanding of the imperial
Parliament such a modification of the
act of legislative union as will allow
the people of Ireland to manage their
purely domestic concerns without in the
least interfering with matters of an imperial
character; and during these memorable
four days, as we have already observed,
the most admirable temper was
manifested and the most perfect order
<pb n='067'/><anchor id='Pg067'/>
maintained, or rather observed; for the
chairman had throughout only to listen
like others and put the question. The
principal, if not the sole, ground of difference
of opinion was the constitution
of the domestic Parliament. To some
members of the conference the House of
Lords seemed a difficulty. Undoubtedly
there cannot be in these realms any
Parliament without a House of Lords,
and there ought not to be. Equally certain
is it that differences&mdash;serious differences&mdash;will
sometimes arise between the
Irish peers and the Irish commons. But
does nothing of the sort ever occur in the
imperial Parliament? Yet, notwithstanding
the dissensions, occasionally of a very
violent character, that happen between the
Houses at Westminster, the constitution
works and the business of the empire is
done, not always in the best fashion, we
admit, but still so to keep the vessel of
state well afloat.</q>
</p>

</quote>

<p>
Many of the bishops and clergy
in England, also, are warm sympathizers,
if not active advocates, of
the proposed repeal, as the following
extract from a recent letter of
the Rt. Rev. Dr. Turner, late Bishop
of Salford, will in part demonstrate.
With regard to home rule, writes
that prelate, <q>it seems to me that
some measure of home rule for
Ireland is certain. It is but a question
of time and amount. Parliament
will, sooner or later, be
obliged to grant it, if only for the
despatch of imperial business. A
strong feeling prevails in favor of
large powers of local and municipal
self-government even in England,
and the extension of this
principle must inevitably come to
Ireland.</q>
</p>

<p>
We cannot but agree with the
good bishop in his views of the necessity
of some change in the parliamentary
system of the United
Kingdoms, at least as far as Ireland
is concerned, and trust, sincerely
trust, that his predictions will be
justified by events, and that very
quickly. With a home government,
a denominational plan of education,
and a fostering public opinion for
ability and native genius, which
would surely follow, that long-suffering
but faithful island might in
the near future equal, or even excel,
the glories that shone around her in
her first ages of Christianity.

<head>Grapes And Thorns. Chapter X. The Descent of Avernus.</head>

<p>
By The Author Of <q>The House of Yorke.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was Annette who told Miss
Pembroke the result of the trial,
taking it on herself as a sort of mission.
Without saying a word on
the subject to each other, perhaps
without defining it clearly in their
own minds, they had yet acted on
an impression that she was to be
treated with peculiar delicacy and
tenderness in the matter.
</p>

<p>
As young Mrs. Gerald came
down the street toward her mother-in-law's
home, she saw Miss Pembroke
approaching her slowly from
the opposite direction, a child at
either side. She was just coming
from her school, and these two
little ones lived in the neighborhood,
and were privileged to walk
home with their teacher, each holding
in its little hands, for warmth, a
fold of her large sable cloak.
</p>

<p>
It was a still, frosty day, with a
sparkling depth of cloudless blue
overhead, and a spotless carpet of
newly-fallen snow, white as swan's-down,
underneath. But the mid-air,
rosy now with sunset, imparted
a tinge of violet to the sky and a
soft blush to the earth. Sleighs,
with their gay bells, flew to and fro,
the drivers muffled to the eyes from
the stinging cold; and the planks
of the sidewalk crackled under the
steps that trod them.
</p>

<p>
<q>What a motherly look she has!</q>
Annette Gerald said to herself, as
she stood waiting at the gate, and
watching her friend.
</p>

<p>
Honora had quite a matronly
appearance, indeed, in the thick furs
she always wore in winter. She
was fond of warmth, and scarcely
quick enough in her motions to
resist the cold of a northern climate
by means of exercise alone, and the
cap, muff, boa, and mantle made her
look like a Juno exiled to the court
of Odin. The cold melancholy of
her expression, the face as untouched
with color as a white camellia,
was in keeping with the fancy.
</p>

<p>
She did not hasten when she saw
a visitor waiting for her, nor give
any smile or word of welcome. If
there was a sign of emotion, it was
in the slight gesture with which she
detached herself from her two little
attendants, who, for the first time,
missed the leave-taking they prized
so much. They had been wont to
be stroked on the cheeks, with a
gentle <q>Good-by</q>; and, running,
hand in hand, down the street, to
turn at the first corner, and see their
teacher wave her hand to them as
she stood on the piazza.
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear Annette, why did you
not go in, instead of freezing here
in the snow?</q> she said, and seemed
too much occupied in opening the
gate to be able to look in her friend's
face, though her disengaged hand
held that of her visitor closely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! I never feel the cold in
this still weather,</q> Annette said
lightly. <q>Besides, I do not like to
enter alone a deserted house. There
is no one here but the servant.
Mamma Gerald is with us, and we
persuaded her to stay to dinner.
I wish you would go up too.</q>
</p>

<pb n='069'/><anchor id='Pg069'/>

<p>
They had entered the house.
Miss Pembroke paused a moment
at the foot of the stairs, then led
the way up to her chamber. Evidently
she knew that there were
tidings for her, and suspected that
they were not good. <q>I shall not
dine at home to-day,</q> she said,
catching sight of the servant.
</p>

<p>
But she did not, apparently, mean
to go out, for she deliberately removed
her wrappings, and put them
away; then seated herself beside
her friend, and looked at her with
an expression that bade her speak
out her errand, whatever it might
be.
</p>

<p>
<q>It has gone as badly as it could,</q>
Annette said quickly.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is, then, found guilty?</q> Miss
Pembroke asked, without the slightest
sign of emotion.
</p>

<p>
Annette nodded. <q>He is convicted
on circumstantial evidence.
It is as plain as such evidence can
be, but not plain enough to shake
my hope, at least, of his innocence.
Lawrence is utterly disgusted and
indignant with the whole affair.
He says he would at any time head
a party to rescue Mr. Schöninger.
He felt so angry that he wouldn't
stay at home after coming up to
tell us, but started off again somewhere.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is he sentenced?</q> Miss Pembroke
asked, speaking with some
difficulty.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes!</q> And since the eyes fixed
on her still waited for more, Mrs.
Gerald added: <q>There is a year
solitary.</q>
</p>

<p>
Honora's eyes opened a little
wider. <q>A year solitary?</q> she
repeated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, yes, dear. You know it
is the custom to give a year of solitary
imprisonment before....</q>
</p>

<p>
Miss Pembroke put her hand up,
and seemed to clear some mist from
before her eyes. <q>Before what?</q>
she asked in a confused way.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dear Honora!</q> exclaimed her
friend, <q>need I say what?</q> And
then started up with a little cry;
for Miss Pembroke, without a word
or sign of warning, had slipped out
of her chair, and fallen heavily to
the floor.
</p>

<p>
It is not necessary to make an
outcry because a lady has fainted,
unless there is no person of sense
present. Annette Gerald did what
was needful without calling for
help, and her efforts were soon rewarded.
The cold hand she held
suddenly became warm and moist
as the recoiling wave of life rushed
back, and in a few minutes Miss
Pembroke was able to rise from the
floor, and go to the sofa. Annette
sat by her in silence, now and then
touching her hand or her hair with
caressing fingers, and waited for
her to speak.
</p>

<p>
If she had to wait some time, it
was not because her friend had not
returned to full consciousness. Miss
Pembroke was too strong and
healthy to creep back to life, even
after so violent and unaccustomed
an attack. It was, perhaps, the
first time she had ever fainted, and
she was left almost ignorant of
what had happened to her; but of
the cause she was not a moment in
doubt. It came back clearly on
the first wave of returning consciousness.
She lay with her eyes
closed, and strove to set her mind
in order again, and set it so firmly
that this terrible and entirely unexpected
fact should not again derange
its action. She had not once
anticipated such a conclusion.
Her thoughts had occupied themselves
with the horrors of the accusation,
and the worst result she
had looked for was that, though the
prisoner would doubtless be acquitted,
<pb n='070'/><anchor id='Pg070'/>
he would not be able to
shake off the disgrace of having
been suspected, and would go out
into life branded with an ineffaceable
mark&mdash;a mark which his name
would bear even in her own mind.
She had said to herself that, pity
him as she might, she desired never
to see him again, not because she
believed him capable of any great
crime, but because his image would
always be associated with painful
recollections, and because his dignity
had been soiled by such circumstances
and associations. Now,
however, he was presented to her
mind in quite a new light, more
pitiful, yet with a pity far more
shrinking and remote from its object.
In this woman, confidence
in, and obedience to, authority was
an instinct; and as she contemplated
the decision of the law against
Mr. Schöninger, she began to look
on him somewhat as a Catholic
looks upon those whom the anathema
of the church has separated
from the fellowship of the faithful,
<q>so that they are not so much as to
say to them, God speed you.</q> A
silent and awful distance grew up
between them.
</p>

<p>
After a while, she sat up, and began
calmly to put her hair and dress
in order.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is very terrible, Annette, and
we may as well try to put it quite
out of our minds,</q> she said. <q>We
can do nothing, that I see, but pray
for his conversion. I thank you
for coming alone to tell me of this,
for I would not have had any other
person see me so much affected by
the news. People imagine things
and tell them as facts, and there
are many who are capable of believing
that I had loved Mr. Schöninger.
I never did.</q>
</p>

<p>
There were times when Honora
Pembroke's soft eyes could give a
look that was almost dazzling in
its firm and open clearness; and as
she pronounced these last words,
she looked into her companion's
face with such a glance.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald rose and walked
somewhat impatiently to the window.
She had hoped and expected
to startle Honora into some
generous expression of interest in
Mr. Schöninger, and to win from
her some word of pity and kindness
which, repeated to him, would be
like a drop of cooling water in his
fiery trial.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am sure I should never imagine
you capable of having an affection
for any one whom the whole
world does not approve,</q> she said
rather pointedly, having snatched
the curtain up and looked out, then
dropped it again. <q>If you can put
the subject out of your mind, and
remember Mr. Schöninger only
when you are praying for the heathen,
so much the better for your
tranquillity. I am not so happily
constituted. I cannot dismiss the
thought of friends because it troubles
me, nor because some person,
or many persons, may believe something
against them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What would you have me do?</q>
Miss Pembroke asked rather loftily,
yet with signs of trouble in her
face.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing, my dear, except that
you put on your bonnet and come
home to dinner with me,</q> Annette
replied, assuming a careless tone.
</p>

<p>
Miss Pembroke hesitated, then
refused. It would be certainly more
sensible to go if she could, but she
felt herself a little weak and trembling
yet, and disinclined to talk.
The best distraction for her would
be such as she could find in reading
or in prayer, if distraction were
needed. She felt, moreover, the
coldness that had come over her
<pb n='071'/><anchor id='Pg071'/>
friend's manner more than Annette
was aware, and for a moment, perhaps,
wrung by a cruel distrust of
herself, envied her that independence
of mind and ardor of feeling
which could at need strengthen her
to face any difficulty, and which
rendered her capable of holding
firmly her own opinions and belief
in spite of opposition. Miss Pembroke
seemed to herself in that instant
weak and puny, not because
she did nothing for Mr. Schöninger,
but because, had she seen the possibility
or propriety of her doing anything,
she would have lacked the
courage. It was a relief to her,
therefore, to find herself alone,
though, at the same time, she would
gladly have had the support and
strength which her friend's presence
could so well impart to one in trouble.
</p>

<p>
The door closed, and she looked
from the window and saw her visitor
walk briskly away without glancing
back.
</p>

<p>
<q>I wish I had some one,</q> she
murmured, dropping the curtain
from her hand, and looking about
the room as if to find some suggestion
of help. <q>I am certainly very
much alone in the world. Mother
Chevreuse is gone; I cannot go to
F. Chevreuse about this; and the
others jar a little with me.</q>
</p>

<p>
And then, like a ray of soft and
tender light coming unexpectedly
to show the path through a dark
place, came the thought of Sister
Cecilia and her gentle companions.
They had asked her to come to
them, if they could ever be of any
use to her, and Sister Cecilia particularly
had spoken to her with an
affectionate earnestness which was
now joyfully remembered. <q>I cannot
hope to be to you what Mother
Chevreuse was, but I would be glad
if I could in a little, even, supply
her loss to you. Come to me, if you
ever wish to, quite freely. You
will never find me wanting in sympathy
or affection.</q>
</p>

<p>
And she had scarcely been to
them at all!
</p>

<p>
She dressed herself hastily, and
called a carriage. It was too late to
walk there, for already the sun was
down; and it was nearly two miles
to the convent.
</p>

<p>
The sharp air and brisk motion
were restorative. They brought a
color to her face, and sent new life
through her weakened frame. Besides,
when one feels helpless and
distressed, rapid motion gives a relieving
impression that one is doing
and accomplishing something, while,
at the same time, it saves the necessity
of effort.
</p>

<p>
Sister Cecilia was in her own
room, writing letters, her little desk
drawn close to the window for the
light. She looked out when she
heard the carriage, and beckoned
Miss Pembroke to come up-stairs
then hurried to meet her half way.
She had guessed her visitor's motive
in coming, and it needed but a
glance into her face to confirm the
thought.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come into my chamber, dear,</q>
she said. <q>It is the pleasantest
room in the house at this hour.
See what a view I have of the city
and the western sky. I sit here to
write my letters, and every moment
have to leave off to admire the
beautiful world outside. It is a
sort of dissipation with me, this
hour of sunset. This arm-chair is
for you. It is my visitor's chair.
I should feel quite like a sybarite
if I were to sit in it.</q>
</p>

<p>
She seated Honora by the window,
drew up her own chair opposite
her, and went on talking cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>I sometimes think that all the
<pb n='072'/><anchor id='Pg072'/>
earth needs to make it heaven is
the visible presence of our Lord and
his saints. It would require no
physical change. Of course I include
the absence of sin. There is
so much beauty here, so much that
we never notice, so much that is
everyday, yet miraculous for all
that. Look at that sky! Did you
ever see such a rich air? It needs
the cold purity of the snow to keep
it from seeming excessive.</q>
</p>

<p>
A long, narrow cloud had stretched
itself across the west, and, drawing
to its bosom the light of the sun,
now hidden behind the hills, reflected
it in a crimson flood over the
earth. Through this warm effulgence
fell, delicately penetrating,
the golden beams of the full moon,
changing the crimson of the air to a
deep-opal color, and putting faint
splashes of gilding here and there
beside the rosy reflections.
</p>

<p>
<q>How the earth draws it in!</q>
said the nun dreamily. <q>It never
wastes the beauties of the sky.
It hoards them up, and gives them
out long after in marbles and precious
stones. Did it ever occur to
you to wonder how those bright
things could grow in the dark underground?
I used to think of it
in Italy, where I first saw what
marbles can be. I remember my
eyes and my mind wandering to
that as I knelt before the Confession
of S. Matthew the Evangelist,
in Santa Maria Maggiore, where
the walls of the atrium glow with
marbles; and the lesson I learned
from it was this: that even though
pains and sorrows of every kind
should intervene between us and
the joy of life as thickly as the clay,
and rock, and turf had intervened
between the sunshine of heaven
and the dark place where those
marbles took form and color, we
could yet, if we had real faith, be
conscious of all the glory and joy
taking place overhead, and reproduce
them for ourselves down in
the dark, and make that beauty
more enduring because we were in
the dark. At the sunny surface,
the brightness slips off and shadows
succeed; but that solid jewel in the
depths is indestructible. My dear</q>&mdash;she
turned to her companion with
a soft suddenness which warmed
but did not startle&mdash;<q>do you remember
S. Paul's recommendation,
<q>always rejoice</q>? It is possible.
And now tell me why you do
not.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her eyes, beaming with religious
enthusiasm and tenderest human
affection, searched frankly the pale
face before her, and her hand was
laid lightly on Miss Pembroke's
arm. No reserve nor timidity could
stand before her. They melted
like snowflakes beneath the heavenly
summer of her glances. Honora
told freely and simply what had
distressed her.
</p>

<p>
How sweet is the friendship of
one true woman for another!&mdash;sweeter
than love, for it is untroubled,
and has something of the
calmness of heaven; deeper than
love, for it is the sympathy of true
natures which reflect each the entire
being of the other; less selfish
than love, for it asks no merging of
another into itself; nobler than
love, for it allows its object to have
other sources of happiness than
those it can furnish; more enduring
than love, for it is a life, and
not a flame.
</p>

<p>
<q>But can you not see, my dear,</q>
the nun said presently, <q>that it
would have been better if you had
not had any friendly intercourse
with him, even though this terrible
thing had never happened? The
injunction not to be unequally
yoked with one another refers, I
<pb n='073'/><anchor id='Pg073'/>
think, to all ties as well as to marriage.
The gulf is too wide between
the Christian and the Jew to
be bridged over for familiar friendship.
It is too wide for anything
but prayers to cross. Once admit
any intercourse with unbelievers,
and you peril your faith; and, besides,
you cannot set a barrier
firmly anywhere when the first one
is down. I have heard it said that
this Jew loved you, and even fancied
it possible that you would
marry him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>People ought not to say such
things!</q> exclaimed Miss Pembroke,
blushing deeply.
</p>

<p>
<q>People ought not to have the
chance to say such things, my dear
girl,</q> replied the nun. <q>It was offering
you an insult when he offered
you his hand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O dear Sister! is not that too
severe?</q> expostulated Honora.
<q>Setting aside what has happened
since, should I not recollect, when
a man makes me such an offer,
what his intention is, and how the
subject looks to him? And cannot
I refuse him, and see that it is impossible
for me to do otherwise,
yet feel kindly toward him, and
wish him well, and believe that he
has meant to show me both affection
and respect?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Honora,</q> said the Sister, <q>if
any man had struck your mother,
then turned to offer you his hand,
would you not have recoiled from
him in disgust and indignation?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Surely I would!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And is your God and Saviour
less dear and sacred to you than
your mother?</q> the other pursued.
<q>Can you allow your thoughts to
dwell with kindness and complacency
on one who blasphemes the
crucified Redeemer, and calls him
an impostor? Because you have
not heard this man talk against
your faith, you forget what he must
think of it. I tell you they mock
at him, these Jews, and they call
us idolaters. And what could he
think of you, when, knowing that
you adore Christ as God, he asked
you to be the wife of one who
would laugh, if he did not rave,
when he saw you making the sign
of the cross? He must have
thought your faith so weak that
he could in time make you renounce
it. And the reason why he
thought so was because he saw you
receiving him in a friendly way, as
if friendship were possible between
you. I speak of what he was.
What he is, we have nothing to do
with.</q>
</p>

<p>
Miss Pembroke's eyes were down-cast.
<q>When you place the subject
in that light, I am forced to think
myself all in the wrong,</q> she said.
<q>But most people do not think in
that clear, positive way. They act
on an inherited motive, and their
beliefs are moss grown, as it were.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They have no faith,</q> was the
quick reply.
</p>

<p>
Honora was silent a moment,
then said, with some hesitation: <q>I
am always afraid of being uncharitable
and illiberal, and perhaps I
err the other way.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear, it is easy to make a
mistake there, and very dangerous
too,</q> the Sister replied with decision.
<q>What is charity? You
must first love God with all your
heart; and if you do that, you will
be very shy of the enemies of God.
You cannot serve two masters. As
to liberality, there is no greater
snare. It is not liberal to squander
the bounty and honor of God; it is
not ours to spend. It is not liberal
to praise those whom he condemns,
and bless those whom he curses.
It is not liberal to love those who
refuse to acknowledge and obey
<pb n='074'/><anchor id='Pg074'/>
him, and to contradict what he has
clearly said. Or if these things are
liberal, then liberality is one of the
worst of vices, and one of the most
futile too. Why, if I were to desire
the reputation of being generous,
and, having nothing of my own,
should take what is not mine and
give it away, I have stolen, it is true,
and I have obtained a reputation
that I do not deserve, but, also, I
have enriched some one; whereas,
if I put my hand into the treasury
of God, and try to bestow on another
what he has denied, the hand
comes out empty. I have insulted
the Almighty, and have not benefited
any one. Do not suffer yourself
to be deceived by sounding
phrases. What are these people
who talk so much of liberality?
Are they liberal of what is theirs to
give? Far from it. Do they give
away all they have to the poor?
Do they forgive their enemies?
Do they give up their pride and
vanity, and spend their lives in laboring
for the needy? Quite the
contrary. They are lavish only of
what is not theirs to give. It has
been reserved for those whom they
call bigots to show an ardent and
unsparing liberality in sacrificing
their private feelings, their wealth,
their comfort, their reputation, their
lives even, for the glory of God and
the saving of souls. There is the
true liberality, my dear, and all
other is a snare.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wish I could shut myself up
with God, and get into the right
path again. I am all wrong.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why not come here and make
a retreat?</q> the Sister asked.
</p>

<p>
It was so precisely and unexpectedly
what she needed that Honora
clasped her hands, with an exclamation
of delight. <q>The very
thing! Yet I had not thought of
it. When may I come? Very soon?
It was surely an inspiration, my
coming here to-night.</q>
</p>

<p>
Immediately her troubles began
to lift themselves away, as fogs begin
to rise from the earth even before
the sun is above the horizon.
The certainty of approaching peace
conferred a peace in the present.
She was going to place herself in
the hands of Him who can perform
the impossible.
</p>

<p>
Sister Cecilia had supplied her
need perfectly. Hers was not one
of those impassioned natures which
need to be, soothed and caressed
into quiet. A certain vein of gentle
self-sufficiency, and a habit of
contentment with life as she found
it, prevented this. She wanted light
more than warmth.
</p>

<p>
It was already dark when they
went down-stairs, and since, from
economy, the nuns did not have
their entries lighted, the two had to
go hand-in-hand, groping their way
carefully, till they came to a turn
in the lower passage; and there,
from the open door of the chapel
at the further end, a soft ray of light
shone out from the single lamp that
burned before the altar. By daylight
both chapel and altar showed
poor enough; but in the evening,
and seen alone by this small golden
flame, the imperfections were either
transformed or hidden. Dimly seen,
the long folds of drapery all about
gave a sense of seclusion and tenderness;
one seemed to be hiding
under the mantle of the Lord; and
the beautiful mystery of the burning
lamp made wonders seem possible.
Kneeling there alone, one
could fancy all the beautiful legends
being acted over again.
</p>

<p>
Sister Cecilia and Honora, still
hand-in-hand, knelt in the entry
the moment they saw that light.
</p>

<p>
<q>You remember the chalice of
the bees?</q> whispered the nun.
</p>

<pb n='075'/><anchor id='Pg075'/>

<p>
<q>I never come here in the evening,
and see that bright little place in
the darkness, but I think of that
sweetest of stories. And I would
not be surprised to hear a buzzing
of bees all about the sanctuary, and
see the busy little creatures building
up a chalice of fine wax, as
clear as an alabaster vase with a
light inside.</q>
</p>

<p>
They walked slowly and noiselessly
by the door, and, as they
passed it, saw beside the altar what
looked almost like another lamp, or
like that illuminated vase the Sister
had fancied. It was the face of
Anita, which reflected the light, her
dark dress rendering her form almost
invisible. That face and the
two folded hands shone softly, with
a fixed lustre, out of the shadows.
No breath nor motion seemed to
stir them. The eyes fixed on the
tabernacle, the lips slightly parted
where the last vocal prayer had
escaped, she knelt there in a trance
of adoration. But one could see,
even through that brightening halo
and sustaining peace, that a great
change had taken place in the girl
during the last few weeks. Her face
was worn quite thin; and the large
eyes, that had been like dewy violets
bending ever toward the earth,
burned now with a lustre that never
comes from aught but pain.
</p>

<p>
<q>How the innocent have to suffer
for the sins of the guilty!</q> sighed
the nun, as she led her visitor away.
<q>That child has received a blow
from which I am afraid she will
never recover. She is like a broken
flower that lives a little while when
it is put in water. Her conscience
is at rest; she does not say now that
she is sorry for having had anything
to do with that trial; she does not
complain in any way. She seems
simply broken. And here she
comes now! She has heard our
steps, and is afraid she has stayed
too long in the chapel.</q>
</p>

<p>
The young girl came swiftly
along the passage, and held out her
hands to Miss Pembroke. <q>I knew
you were here,</q> she said, <q>and I
was waiting to hear you come down.
Mother told me I might come and
say good-by to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you have not yet said a
word of welcome,</q> Miss Pembroke
replied, trying to speak cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! yes, when I saw you come,
I welcomed you in my own mind,</q>
she replied, without smiling.
</p>

<p>
Honora waited an instant, but
Anita seemed to have nothing to
say except the good-by she had
come for. <q>Our whispering did
not disturb your prayers?</q> she asked,
wishing to detain her a little
longer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! no.</q> She glanced up at
Sister Cecilia, as a child, when
doubtful and lost, looks into its
mother's face, then dropped her
eyes dreamily. <q>I do not say any
prayer but <q>amen.</q> Nothing else
comes. I kneel down, thinking to
repeat, perhaps, the rosary, and I
am only silent a while, and then I
say amen. It is as well, I suppose.</q>
</p>

<p>
Honora kissed the child's thin
cheek tenderly. <q>Good-by, dear,</q>
she whispered softly. <q>Say one
amen for me to-night.</q>
</p>

<p>
She went out into the still and
sparkling night, and was driven
rapidly homeward. On her way,
she passed the prison, and, looking
up, saw over the high wall a
light shining redly through the long
row of grated windows. It was a
painful sight, but no longer unendurable.
<q>No prayer but amen,</q>
she repeated. <q>What does it matter
by what road we go, so long as
we reach heaven at last; whether it
be in peaceful ways, or through sin
and suffering?</q>
</p>

<pb n='076'/><anchor id='Pg076'/>

<p>
Another carriage drew up at the
gate as she reached home, and Mrs.
Gerald descended from it, having
just returned from Mrs. Ferrier's.
</p>

<p>
<q>Upon my word, young woman!</q>
Annette's voice called out from a
pile of furs in the carriage. <q>We
have been saying our good-nights
in whispers, and hushing the very
sleigh-bells, so as not to disturb your
slumbers; and here you are out
driving.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her bright and cheerful voice
broke strangely into Honora's mood.
Was there, then, anything in the
world to laugh about, anything that
could possibly excite a jest?
</p>

<p>
<q>Good-night, Mother Gerald!</q>
the young woman added. <q>Don't
stand there taking cold. And if
you do not see Honora in the house
to-night, make up your mind that
I have carried her off with me, as I
shall try to. Come here, my dear,
and give an account of yourself.
Where have you been?</q>
</p>

<p>
As Honora reached the carriage
door, young Mrs. Gerald leaned
out and caught both her hands.
<q>Come with me to find Lawrence,</q>
she whispered hurriedly. <q>He has
not been home yet, but he will go
for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Though recoiling from the errand,
Miss Pembroke would not refuse it.
She stepped into the carriage, and
suffered herself to be driven away.
It was the first time such a service
had ever been demanded of her.
<q>Where is he? Do you know?</q>
she asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! yes. He is only playing
billiards,</q> the young wife answered,
and a sharp sigh seemed to cut the
sentences apart. <q>It is the first
time for a long while, and I want
to break it up in the beginning.
John went down and told him that
his mother was dining with us, but
Lawrence paid no attention.</q>
</p>

<p>
She leaned back a little while
without saying a word as they sped
over the smooth snow. <q>It seems
a shame to drag you into such an
affair, Honora,</q> she said presently;
<q>and I had not thought of it till I
saw you, and then it came like a
flash that you could help me.
What I want of you is to write on
a card that you and I are waiting
for him. John will carry it in to him,
and he will recognize your writing.</q>
</p>

<p>
The horses were drawn up before
a large marble hotel, lighted
from basement to attic. The shops
underneath were all closed; but
from three broad lower windows a
bright light shone around the
heavy lowered curtains, and in the
stillness they could hear the faint
click of billiard-balls. There was
no sound of voices from inside,
and it was impossible to know if
the players were few or many.
</p>

<p>
Honora wrote hastily, by the
moonlight, as she was bid, <q>Annette
and I are waiting for you,</q> and
John took the card.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why doesn't he go to this
door?</q> she asked, seeing the man
disappear around a corner of the
house.
</p>

<p>
<q>You child!</q> said her friend
compassionately; <q>are you so innocent
as to suppose that any one
can walk into one of those places
when he pleases? These charming
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>réunions</foreign> are held with locked
doors, and one has to have the
password to go in.</q>
</p>

<p>
Honora was silent with indignation.
To her mind, Lawrence
could not do his wife a greater injury
than in allowing her to become
acquainted with such places,
and she was half disposed to be
vexed with Annette for not leaving
him to himself, and refusing to be
drawn into any objectionable scenes
and associations.
</p>

<pb n='077'/><anchor id='Pg077'/>

<p>
Annette divined the last thought,
and replied to it.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is impossible for a wife to be
scrupulous as to the means by
which she shall withdraw her husband
from danger,</q> she said with
quiet coldness. <q>They are one.
If he is soiled, she cannot be quite
clean, except in intention, unless
she is very selfish; and then her
intention is not good, which is
worse yet. Of course she should
be careful not to draw others into
her affairs.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You must know far better than
I, Annette,</q> her friend said quickly,
feeling as though she must have
spoken her thought. <q>At all events,
you cannot be called selfish. And,
indeed, if the angels of heaven
were over-scrupulous with regard
to their associations, we should
lack their guardianship.</q>
</p>

<p>
Here John appeared, walking
briskly round the corner of the
hotel, and immediately after Lawrence
Gerald came to the carriage-door.
</p>

<p>
<q>You here, Honora!</q> he exclaimed.
<q>What could have induced
you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We had better not ask each
other questions,</q> she replied coldly.
<q>It is late. Will you come
home with us?</q>
</p>

<p>
She drew back into a corner,
and made room for him, with an
air almost of disgust; for the moonlight
showed his face flushed with
drinking, and, as he spoke, a strong
odor of brandy had been wafted
into her face.
</p>

<p>
He was too much confused for
anything but simple obedience, and
in rather a stumbling way took the
seat assigned him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Honora has been driving this
evening, and is sleepy and chilly,</q>
his wife made haste to say in explanation,
inwardly resenting her
friend's <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>hauteur</foreign>, and regretting
having brought her. <q>She is going
home to stay all night with us.
I am sure you did not know how
late it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
She furtively picked up his hat,
that had fallen off, went on talking
lightly, to cover his silence or prevent
his saying anything senseless,
and tried in every way to screen him
from the scorn that she had exposed
him to. He leaned back in
the carriage, and took no notice of
her. The presence of Honora
Pembroke had confounded him,
and he had just sense enough left
to know that he could not keep too
quiet. What had stirred her to
interfere in his affairs he could not
guess, for Annette had always so
screened him that it never occurred
to him she could have asked
her friend to come. Had he
known, it would have fared hard
with his wife. He had, however,
prudence and temper enough to
keep him from making any disagreeable
demonstration. John was
at hand when they reached home,
and, as the ladies went hastily up
the steps and into the house, they
were not supposed to be aware
that it was his arm which enabled
Mr. Gerald to go in without falling.
Then Mrs. Ferrier stood in
the open drawing-room door, and,
under cover of her welcome to
Honora, he managed to get up
stairs unnoticed, fortunately for
all.
</p>

<p>
For the truce between Annette's
husband and her mother was over,
and their intercourse was assuming
a more unpleasant character
than ever. Now, it was nearly
always Lawrence who was the
aggressor. Even when Mrs. Ferrier
showed a disposition to conciliate,
he found something irritating
in her very good-nature. Partial
<pb n='078'/><anchor id='Pg078'/>
as his mother was, she was
moved to expostulate with him
after witnessing two or three of
these scenes.
</p>

<p>
<q>You ought to recollect her good
intention, Lawrence, and try to
overlook her manner,</q> she said.
<q>I know well she does not show
very good taste always; but you
cannot criticise a woman in her own
house.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am seldom allowed to forget
that it is her house,</q> returned the
son rather sulkily.
</p>

<p>
<q>At least, my dear, do not provoke
her into reminding you of
that,</q> Mrs. Gerald urged.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence wished to stand well
with his mother, and had, indeed,
improved in his behavior toward
her in proportion as he had grown
more impatient with Mrs. Ferrier.
He seemed now to regret having
answered her unpleasantly. <q>If
you knew, mother, all the little annoyances
I have to bear from her,
you wouldn't blame me so much,</q>
he said coaxingly. <q>With other frets,
she has a habit of asking any of us
who may be going out where we
are going, and when we are coming
back; and Annette has humored
her in that till she thinks she has a
right to know. Teddy always tells
her, too; but then he tells lies.
That makes no difference, though,
to her. Well, I have broken her
of asking me when I am alone; but
if Annette is with me, she asks her.
Can't you imagine, mother, that it
would get to be irritating after a
while? It makes me so nervous
sometimes that I have really skulked
out of the house slyly, as if I had
no right to go. And then, when I
come in, she will say, <q>Why, where
have you been, Lawrence? I didn't
hear you go out.</q> If a door opens
anywhere, she goes to see who is
about. I believe if I should get
up in the middle of the night, and
try to creep out of the house without
being heard, I should see her
head poked out of the chamber-door
before I'd got half-way down-stairs.
Then she peers and finds
out everything. Annette and I had
a bottle of champagne the other
night in our room, and the next
morning she spied out the bottle,
and spoke of it. I suppose she
heard the cork pop when I drew
it. You never looked after me
half so closely when I was a little
boy, always in mischief, as she does
now I am a man. She knows what
my clothes cost, every rag of them,
and how many clean collars and
handkerchiefs I have in the week.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am sure she need not trouble
herself about how much your clothes
cost, since you pay for them yourself,</q>
Mrs. Gerald said, her face
very red. <q>And if she grudges
you clean collars, send your linen
home, and I will have it washed
there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! she has no such thought,</q>
Lawrence made haste to say.
<q>She doesn't mean to be cross
about any of these things, but only
prying. She wants to overlook
everybody and everything in the
house, and it annoys me. I only
tell you so that you may not wonder
if I do speak out now and then
about some small thing. Then
what do you think she has proposed
about my going into business?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well?</q> Mrs. Gerald said uneasily.
</p>

<p>
<q>She has selected a partner for
me.</q>
</p>

<p>
His mother waited for an explanation.
</p>

<p>
<q>And who should it be but
John!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>John who?</q> asked Mrs. Gerald
wonderingly, trying to recollect
<pb n='079'/><anchor id='Pg079'/>
some notable person of that name
among her youthful acquaintances.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, I do not know that he
has any other name. The big English
fellow who lets you in here,
and waits at dinner, and opens and
shuts the carriage-door.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What! you do not mean the
footman?</q> Mrs. Gerald cried.
</p>

<p>
Her son laughed bitterly. <q>I asked
her if he was to open the shop-door,
and carry parcels, and if he would
have the same sort of cockade on
his hat, and she got quite angry
about it. She says he has saved a
good deal of money, and means
to go into business, and she thinks
I couldn't have a better partner.
What do you think of it, mother?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald leaned back in her
chair, and put her hand up to her
face, half hiding a blush of vexation.
</p>

<p>
She was not willing to tell Lawrence
all she thought of the matter.
<q>What does Annette say?</q> she
asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>Annette vetoed the proposal
up and down. I've heard nothing
of it for a week or more. I only
told you because you seem to think
me too difficult.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald sighed. She had
hoped to see her son busy and contented
after his marriage, and she
found him only more idle and dissatisfied
than before. With the
partiality of a mother, she tried
still to find him unfortunate instead
of blameworthy, and, rather than
see any fault in him, looked only
at his difficulties, refusing to recollect
how easily he could now overcome
them all. She fancied erroneously
that to suggest to him that
his trials had a good deal of brightness
to relieve them, would be to
show a lack of sympathy and tenderness,
and that the best way to
comfort him was to let him see
that his annoyances showed in her
eyes as misfortunes. It was a mistake
which, in her over-sensitive
affection, she had always made with
him.
</p>

<p>
His wife acted otherwise. <q>There
is no use in anticipating evil, Lawrence,</q>
she said. <q>Perhaps that
may be the means of bringing it
about. Fortune loves a smiling countenance.
As to mamma's plans and
wishes with regard to John, the best
way for us is to assume that it is
impossible she should ever regard
him as anything but a servant.
And, indeed,</q> she concluded with
dignity, <q>I think she never can do
otherwise.</q>
</p>

<p>
But this assumption did not prevent
young Mr. Gerald from going
privately to F. Chevreuse, and begging
him to interfere and try to
bring her mother to reason; and
perhaps Mrs. Ferrier was never so
near being in open revolt against
her pastor as when he undertook to
show her that there were certain
social distinctions which it was her
duty to recognize and respect.
</p>

<p>
<q>I think, F. Chevreuse,</q> she said
stiffly, <q>that a priest might do
better than encourage pride and
haughtiness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He could scarcely do worse
than encourage them,</q> he replied
calmly; <q>and it is precisely against
these sins that I would put you on
your guard. Persons are never
more in danger of falling into them
than when they are complaining of
the pride of others, and trying to
reform what they conceive to be
the abuses of society and the world.
The only reformer whom I respect,
and who is in a thoroughly safe
way, is that one who strives to reform
and perfect himself. When he is
perfect, then he can begin to correct
the faults of others. Moreover,
the established customs and
distinctions of society have often a
<pb n='080'/><anchor id='Pg080'/>
good foundation, and are not lightly
to be set aside. What would you
say if your chambermaid should insist
on sitting down to dinner with
you and driving out with you?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ferrier found herself unprepared
to answer. Indeed, no lady
could be more peremptory and exacting
than she was with all her
servants except John. She was
not yet ready to explain that her
generalities all had reference to one
exceptional case.
</p>

<p>
<q>But John is not at all a common
servant,</q> she ventured to say.
<q>He never lived out but once before,
and then it was with a very
grand family in England; and he
wouldn't have come here with us,
only that he wanted to look round
a while before setting up business.
I had to coax him to come, and
give him the very highest wages.
And Annette did all she could to
persuade him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>John is an excellent man, I am
sure,</q> F. Chevreuse replied. <q>I
hope he will succeed in whatever
good work he attempts. But we
were speaking of your daughter's
husband. My advice is that he return
to the office where he was before,
and remain there till something
better presents itself. I do not approve
of any large and showy enterprise
for him. It would not suit
him. In that office his salary
would be enough to render him
quite independent, and leave him a
little to lay up.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Lay up!</q> repeated Mrs. Ferrier,
with an incredulous circumflex.
</p>

<p>
<q>He will put one-half his income
into his wife's hands, and she can do
as she will with it,</q> F. Chevreuse
replied. <q>Annette has spoken to
me about it, and it is his own proposal.
She will put the money in
bank every month. What he keeps
will be his own affair, and what she
takes will be a small fund for the
future, and will relieve a little that
painful feeling he must have in living
here without paying anything.
It is decidedly the best that can be
done at present. Besides,</q> he added,
seeing objection gathering in
her face, <q>it may save you something.
The young man is not to
blame that he is not rich, and he is
quite ready to take his wife home
to his own mother, and Annette is
quite willing to go, if necessary.
They might live there very happily
and pleasantly; but as, in that case,
Lawrence would be the one on
whom all the expense would fall, I
presume you would make your
daughter an allowance which would
place her on an equality with him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ferrier was forced to consent.
Nothing was further from
her wish than to be separated from
her daughter, not only because she
was more than usually solicitous
for Annette's happiness, and wished
to assure herself constantly that
her husband did not neglect her,
but because she had an almost insane
desire to watch Lawrence in
every way. Nothing so piques the
curiosity of a meddlesome person
as to see any manifestation of a desire
to baffle their searching. The
annoyance naturally felt and often
shown by one who finds himself
suspiciously observed is always
taken by such persons as a proof
that there is something wrong
which he is desirous to conceal.
Moreover, John had let fall a word
of advice which she was not disposed
to disregard.
</p>

<p>
She had been complaining of her
son-in-law.
</p>

<p>
<q>You had better let him pretty
much alone, ma'am,</q> the man replied.
<q>You'll never drive him to
being a sober fellow, nor industrious.
Scolding doesn't mend
<pb n='081'/><anchor id='Pg081'/>
broken china. I have a plan in my
mind for them which I will tell you
after a while, when the right time
comes. He wouldn't thank me for
it now; but by-and-by, if he doesn't
drink himself to death first, he may
think my advice is worth listening
to.</q>
</p>

<p>
John had a quiet, laconic way
which sometimes impressed others
besides his mistress, and she did not
venture to oppose him openly, nor
even to insist on hearing what his
mysterious plan might be.
</p>

<p>
It was, altogether, a miserable
state of affairs, one of those situations
almost more unbearable than
circumstances of affliction, for the
cares were mean, the annoyances
and mortifications petty; and the
mind, which is ennobled by great
trials, was cramped and lowered by
the constant presence of small
troubles which it would fain disregard,
but could not. For, after all,
these small troubles were the signs
of a great one threatening. It was
plain that Lawrence Gerald, if not
stopped, was going to kill himself
with drinking. His frame was too
delicately organized to bear the
alternate fierce heats and wretched
depressions to which he was subjecting
it, and more than one
sharp attack of illness had given
warning that he was exhausting his
vitality.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse came upon him
suddenly one day when he was
suffering from one of these attacks.
The priest had called at Mrs.
Ferrier's, and, learning that Lawrence
was in his room, too unwell
to go out, went up-stairs to him
somewhat against Annette's wish.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will take the responsibility,</q>
he said laughingly. <q>The boy wants
me to wake him up; you women
are too gentle. You are petting
him to death. No, my lady, I do
not want your company. I can
find my own way.</q>
</p>

<p>
And accordingly Lawrence opened
his eyes a few minutes later
to see F. Chevreuse standing by
the sofa where he lay in all the
misery of a complete physical and
mental prostration.
</p>

<p>
The priest drew a chair close to
him, taking no notice of the evident
disinclination of the young man to
his society. <q>Now, my boy,</q> he
said, laying a hand on the invalid's
shrinking arm, <q>are you dosing
yourself up to go through the same
bad business again? What has
come over you? Come! come!
Wake up, and be a man. You are
too good to throw away in this
fashion.</q>
</p>

<p>
The young man turned his face
away with a faint moan of utter
discouragement. <q>I am not worth
bothering about. I've played my
stake in life, and lost, and what is
left is good for nothing. Besides,
if I tried, I shouldn't succeed.
Why do you trouble yourself about
me? I tell you that what there is
left of me isn't worth saving.</q>
</p>

<p>
He spoke with bitter impatience,
and made a gesture as if he would
have sent his visitor away.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse was not so easily
to be dismissed.
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil thinks differently,</q>
he remarked, without stirring. <q>He
is fighting hard for you. Rouse
yourself, and join with those who
are fighting against him! You
have an idea that, because you have
made mistakes and committed sins,
you must lay down your arms.
Nonsense! There are all the lives
of the saints against you. Some
of them never began to try till they
found themselves on the brink of
destruction. You fancy, too, that
because you and your family have
had misfortunes, and because you
<pb n='082'/><anchor id='Pg082'/>
have not been very successful in
trying to become a rich man, you
must stand humbly aside for
cleverer men, and ask no favors.
You're all wrong. God made you,
and put you into the world, just as
he has the rest of us, and you have
a right to the light and air, and to
repair your mistakes and repent of
your sins, without troubling yourself
too much about what people say
and think, and to do the best you
can in worldly affairs without being
humbled or ashamed if you can't
fill your pocket with money quite
as readily as some can. Let the
money go, but don't let your manliness
go, and don't throw away
your soul. You are talking nonsense
when you say that you are
worthless. Respect yourself, and
compel others to respect you, Lawrence.
Nerve yourself, call up
your good resolutions, and ask
God to help you. Despair is a
crime!</q>
</p>

<p>
The young man put his arm up,
and covered his face with it, as
though to hide an emotion he was
ashamed of; or, perhaps, because
the light hurt his eyes. <q>If I could
forget everything, and sleep for a
month without waking, I don't
know but I could begin again and
try to do better,</q> he said faintly.
<q>But there is no life in me now for
anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse rose immediately.
<q>Rest, then, if that is what you
need,</q> he said kindly. <q>Rest, and
forget everything painful. If any
tormenting thought comes, say a
little prayer, and tell it to begone.
Don't drink any liquor to quiet
your mind. Let Annette get you
some gentle sedative. I'll tell her
to keep everybody away from you,
and let you lie here six months, if
you want to. But when you are
better, come to see me.</q>
</p>

<p>
He was standing, ready to go,
but waited for an answer. There
was none. He spoke more earnestly.
</p>

<p>
<q>You know well it is for the best,
Lawrence; and I want you to promise
to come to me when you are
able to go out, before you go to see
any one else.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I will. I promise you.</q>
</p>

<p>
But the promise was given, apparently,
only to get rid of the subject,
and F. Chevreuse went away
feeling that he had accomplished
nothing.
</p>

<p>
Annette went directly to her husband,
somewhat timid as to the reception
she might meet with; but if
he was displeased at having had a
visitor, he did not seem to hold her
responsible. He took the glass
containing the opiate from her
hand, and set it down beside him.
<q>After a while,</q> he said. <q>And
now I am going to lock every one
out of the room, and try to go to
sleep. If I want anything, I will
ring.</q>
</p>

<p>
She began to make some little
arrangements for his comfort, but,
perceiving that they irritated him,
desisted, and left him to himself.
As she went along the passage, she
heard the lock click behind her.
Oddly enough, this little rudeness
gave her a feeling of pleasure, for it
showed that he felt at home there,
and claimed a right to all that was
hers.
</p>

<p>
<q>If only he will sleep!</q> she
thought.
</p>

<p>
He did not sleep. His first act
was to throw away the opiate she
had brought. <q>Some such dose as
they give to teething babies, I suppose,</q>
he muttered. Then he
seated himself on the sofa, and,
clasping his hands over his head,
as if to still the bursting pain there,
remained buried in thought. One
<pb n='083'/><anchor id='Pg083'/>
could see that he was trying to
study out some problem in his
mind, but that difficulties presented
themselves. More than once
his eyes wandered to a little writing-desk
opposite him, and fixed
themselves there. <q>It would remove
the only obstacle,</q> he said;
<q>and yet how can I? That would
be going over it all again. Now I
am not to blame, but only unfortunate;
but if I do that....</q>
</p>

<p>
It was pitiable to see a young
face so distorted by pain of mind
and body, and to see also that the
pain was stinging him into still
more angry revolt.
</p>

<p>
He began pacing up and down
the room, and, in his doubt and distress,
seized upon one of those
strange modes of solving the question
in his mind which, trivial as
they are, most persons have at
some time in their lives had recourse
to.
</p>

<p>
<q>If there is an odd number of
squares in the carpet from corner
to corner of the room, I will do it,</q>
he said, and began to count them.
The number was odd. But, apparently,
he wished to make assurance
doubly sure, for he next counted
the stucco ornaments on the ceiling.
<q>Odd again! Now for the
third trial.</q> He glanced about in
search of the object which was to
decide his fate, and spied a large
patriarchal fly that had crawled out
of its winter hiding-place, and was
clumsily trying its wings.
</p>

<p>
<q>If he can fly over that cord, I
will go,</q> he said; and since this
was the last trial, and the poor insect
seemed to him something like
himself at that moment, he watched
with breathless interest its efforts to
surmount the great obstacle of the
curtain-cord that lay in its path.
The little creature attempted to
crawl over, but, losing its balance,
tumbled off and lay helplessly on
its back. The young man set it
carefully and tenderly on its feet
once more. <q>Now do your best,</q>
he said. <q>You and I have made a
failure, but we will try once again.</q>
</p>

<p>
Inspired, it would seem, by this
encouragement, the fly put out its
wings, gathered all its energies, and
flew over the cord, tumbling ignominiously
on its back again at the
other side.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence Gerald did not give
himself the trouble to assist again
his fallen friend, but went promptly
to pull the bell-tassel. He had
thrown off all responsibility, and,
choosing to see in these trivial
chances the will and guidance of
some intelligence wiser than his
own, resolved instantly on following
where they pointed.
</p>

<p>
<q>I dare say I shall stumble like
that clumsy fly, but I shall succeed
in the end. At all events, I will
try. I can't and won't stay here
any longer. It is torment for me,
and I don't do any one else any
good.</q> He seemed to be arguing
with some invisible companion.
<q>They will be better without me.
Besides, it was not I who decided.
I left it to chance. If it was....</q>
</p>

<p>
His wife entering interrupted the
soliloquy. She found him lying
down, as she had left him, but with
a color in his face that would have
looked like returning health, if it
had not been a little too deep.
</p>

<p>
He stretched his hand out, and
drew her to the footstool by his
side. <q>Now, Ninon,</q> he said
coaxingly, <q>I want you to be a good
girl, and arrange something for me
so that I shall not be annoyed by
questions nor opposition. It's nothing
but a whim; but no matter
for that. I want to go to New
York for a day or two, by myself,
you know, and I must start to-night.
<pb n='084'/><anchor id='Pg084'/>
I'm not going to do any harm, I
promise you. I feel a good deal
better, and I believe the little
journey will cure me. The train
starts at eight o'clock, and it is now
five. It won't take me half an
hour to get ready. Will you manage
it for me, and keep the others
off my shoulders?</q>
</p>

<p>
She consented promptly and
quietly, asking no questions. If
he should choose to tell her anything,
it was well; if not, it was the
same. She knew the meaning of
this coaxing tenderness too well to
presume upon it. It meant simply
that she could be useful to him.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is he going to New York
for?</q> demanded Mrs. Ferrier,
when Annette made the announcement
down-stairs.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, you must not expect
me to tell all my husband's business,</q>
the young woman answered
rather loftily.
</p>

<p>
Poor Annette did not wish to acknowledge
that she knew no more
of her husband's affairs or motives
than her mother did.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then he will want his dinner
earlier?</q> was the next question,
Mrs. Ferrier having, by an effort,
restrained her inclination to make
any further complaints.
</p>

<p>
No; all he wanted was luncheon,
and his wife had ordered that to be
carried up-stairs.
</p>

<p>
<q>I suppose I am not allowed to
ask how long he will be gone?</q> remarked
the mother.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! certainly, mamma; but
that is not quite settled,</q> Annette
said pleasantly. <q>It depends on
circumstances. A few days, probably,
will be the most.</q>
</p>

<p>
When Annette went up-stairs
again, her husband was dressed for
his journey. A valise, locked and
strapped, lay on the sofa at his elbow,
and his wrappings were strewn
about. She observed that the oak
writing-desk, that had not been
opened for months, to her knowledge,
had been opened now. The
key was in the lock, and the lid was
slightly raised. She noticed, too,
that a little inner cover had been
torn out, and lay on the carpet, broken
in two.
</p>

<p>
<q>The carriage will be round in a
few minutes,</q> she said. <q>I thought
you would want plenty of time to
buy your ticket and get a good
seat.</q>
</p>

<p>
He merely nodded in reply, but
looked at her wistfully, as if touched
by her ready compliance with
his wishes, and desirous to see if
any pain or displeasure were hidden
under her quietness.
</p>

<p>
But he detected no sign of any
such feelings. She was merely examining
his fur gloves, to make sure
that the buttons were on, looking
narrowly to the strap of his cloak,
busying herself in the most commonplace
manner with his preparations.
</p>

<p>
<q>Shall I go to the station with
you?</q> she asked carelessly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I wish you would.</q> His tone
was quite earnest.
</p>

<p>
Annette had arranged it so that
they went down-stairs while her
mother was at dinner; and though
the dining-room door had been left
ajar, before Mrs. Ferrier had time
to leave her seat or call out, the
two had left the house, and were
driving through the clear starlight.
</p>

<p>
<q>Annette,</q> her husband said
suddenly, <q>I've been thinking that
if I had a boy, I would bring him
up very strictly. No matter how
much I might wish to indulge him,
I would resist the wish. He should
be taught to control himself from
fear, if he had no other motive.
He should be made hardy, and
healthy, and active. I wouldn't
<pb n='085'/><anchor id='Pg085'/>
allow him much time to dream
and think of himself; he should be
kept busy; and I would never let
him depend on any one, or sit still
and fancy that some great fortune
were going to drop into his hands
without any effort on his part.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald was silent, astonished
by this unexpected lecture, of which
she quite well understood the
meaning. He would have no child
of his brought up as he had been.
But why should he speak of it
now?
</p>

<p>
<q>There's too much liberty and
recklessness among young men,</q> he
went on. <q>They have too much
their own way. Parents ought to
see what misery it will lead to. If
they don't care for what the child
may make them suffer, they ought
to recollect what the child has got
to suffer when at last it wakes up
to life as it is, and finds itself with
ruinous tastes and habits, and not
one right idea of anything. I am
inclined to believe that it would be
better for half the children in the
world if they were brought up and
trained by the state instead of by
their own parents.</q>
</p>

<p>
They had reached the station,
and he stepped slowly out of the
carriage. His wife ventured to ask
how long he would stay away.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! I've nothing to do in New
York,</q> he said carelessly. <q>I
shall not stay there more than two
or three days.</q>
</p>

<p>
He leaned into the carriage, and
took her hands. In the darkness
she could not see his face, though
the light from outside shone in her
own; but his voice was tender and
regretful, even solemn. <q>Good-by,
dear,</q> he said. <q>You have been
only too good to me. May God reward
you!</q>
</p>

<p>
He bent to kiss the hands he
held, then hurried away before she
had recovered herself sufficiently to
speak.
</p>

<p>
<q>What a good-by it was!</q> she
thought with a startled heart.
<q>One would think he were never
coming back again.</q>
</p>

<p>
He did come back, though, and
sooner than he was expected. He
appeared at the door the next evening,
nearly falling in, indeed, so
that John had to steady him. Annette
had run out of the drawing-room
on hearing the servant's exclamation,
but, at sight of her husband
in such a state, was about to
turn back in disgust.
</p>

<p>
<q>It isn't liquor, ma'am,</q> John
said. <q>Something's the matter
with him. I told you yesterday
that he wasn't fit to go away. Just
push that chair this way for him to
sit down in, and bring him a glass
of wine.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I had to come back,</q> the young
man said. <q>I was sicker than I
thought, and not able to go on. I
don't know how I reached Crichton;
and just now, walking up from
the station, the cold wind on my
forehead made me dizzy. I thought
I should feel better to walk. Don't
be frightened, Annette. I can go
up-stairs now.</q>
</p>

<p>
He had every symptom of fever,
and before morning had grown so
much worse that a doctor was sent
for, though much against his will.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't believe in doctors,</q> he
protested. <q>My mother always
cured me when I was sick without
sending for a doctor. It's all guess-work.
They only know what you
tell them, and they sit and stare at
you, and ask you questions when
you don't want to speak a word. I
hate to have a doctor look at me.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gerald was indeed a very
difficult patient for both doctor and
nurse, irritable beyond expression,
and nervous to the verge of delirium.
<pb n='086'/><anchor id='Pg086'/>
At first no one was allowed
near him but his mother. Then he
found her tender sadness depressing,
and insisted on having his wife
in her place. Finally he begged
John to take care of him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Keep the women away, if you
don't want me to lose my senses,</q>
he said to the man. <q>They start
and turn pale or red every time I
cough or speak in my sleep; and
even when they pretend not to
notice, I know they are watching
me all the time. I don't dare to
groan, or sigh, or rave, though it
would sometimes do me good. I
want somebody by me who doesn't
care whether I live or die, but who
just does what I ask him to. Let
Louis open the door and sit up in
the dicky. It's what he was made
for. He's far more of a footman
than you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wouldn't give either of you
your salt as footman,</q> John retorted,
smiling grimly. But he did not
refuse to assume the post of nurse,
and, having undertaken it, rendered
himself so useful and unobtrusive
that the others all gave way to him,
and the sick man had no disposition
to change again. He seemed a
rather hard, dry man, but he was
patient, and showed none of that
obtrusive attention which is sometimes
more troublesome to an invalid
than neglect. If Lawrence
groaned and tossed about, the attendant
took no notice of him; if he
said, <q>John, don't leave me alone a
minute,</q> the man would sit by his
side all night, as untired, apparently,
as a man of wood.
</p>

<p>
So three nights passed, and still
the invalid grew worse.
</p>

<p>
<q>Wouldn't you like to have me
read some prayers to you, sir?</q> the
watcher asked one night. <q>They
might quiet you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Lawrence broke out impatiently:
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you think I am going to die?
I am not. That is what the women
are all crying about. Mrs. Ferrier
came in to-day, and told me she was
having Masses said for me, and
sprinkled me with holy water till I
was drenched. And Bettie, when
she sat here to-day while you were
away, rattled her beads and cried
all the time, till I told her to get
out of the room. That's the way
with some people. The minute a
fellow is sick, they try their best to
scare him to death. Why don't you
offer to read the paper to me, or
tell me an amusing story? Give
me the opiate now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The doctor said you were not
to take another till twelve o'clock,</q>
the attendant said.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't care for the doctor's orders.
Give it to me now. I know
best what I need.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I believe you do,</q> John said
quietly, and gave him the opiate.
</p>

<p>
But in spite of care, and of a determination
to recover, the illness
grew upon him, till finally the physicians
intimated that if he had any
religious preparations to make, they
had better not be delayed any longer,
for his strength was rapidly
wasting, and they could not promise
that the result would not be
fatal.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ferrier went in great distress
to F. Chevreuse.
</p>

<p>
<q>What shall we do?</q> she asked.
<q>After having refused to see a
priest, and flown into a rage whenever
we mentioned the subject, at
last he is willing to have one. But he
will see no one but F. O'Donovan;
and F. O'Donovan is laid up with
gout, so that he cannot move hand
or foot. I went out to him to-day,
and I thought that if he could possibly
be wrapped up and brought in
in a carriage, I would ask him; but,
father, I couldn't have the face to
<pb n='087'/><anchor id='Pg087'/>
speak of it. The doctor doesn't
allow him to stir out of his room.
Even Mrs. Gerald sees that it can't
be done. I've begged Lawrence to
listen to reason, but he is so set
that if he had asked to have the
Pope himself, he'd be mad if we
didn't send a messenger to Rome.
I could send to L&mdash;&mdash; for a priest,
but that might be too late. He is
failing very much. I do wish you'd
go once again, father.</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse had already been
twice, and had been denied admittance
in terms anything but respectful.
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly I will go,</q> he said.
<q>I should have come up this evening,
if I had not been sent for.
Poor Lawrence! I cannot understand
why he should have such a
prejudice against me.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was early twilight when they
reached the house, and, as they entered,
the lamps burned with a faint
ray, as if they, like all sounds and
sights in that place, had been muffled.
</p>

<p>
<q>You go right up and tell him
there's no one to be got but me,</q>
F. Chevreuse said.
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Ferrier shrank back.
<q>He never will consent if I ask
him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Annette, then.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He won't allow Annette near
him,</q> the mother sighed.
</p>

<p>
<q>John,</q> said the priest, <q>will you
go up and tell Mr. Gerald that I
am here to see him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wouldn't venture to, sir,</q>
John answered. <q>I don't believe
it's of any use; and if you'd take
my advice, sir....</q>
</p>

<p>
Even Mrs. Ferrier was scandalized
by the man's presumption, and
faltered out an <q>O John!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will go myself,</q> F. Chevreuse
interrupted. <q>Stay down here, all
you people, and say the rosary for
my success. Say it with all your
hearts. And don't come up-stairs
till you are called.</q>
</p>

<p>
As he went up, a door near the
landing softly opened, and in it
stood the young wife with a face so
woful and deathlike that tears would
have seemed joyful in comparison.
She said not a word, but stood and
looked at the priest in a kind of
terror.
</p>

<p>
<q>My poor child!</q> he said pityingly,
<q>why do you stay here alone,
killing yourself with grief? Go and
stay with your mother and Honora
till I come down.</q>
</p>

<p>
She made that painful effort to
speak which shows that the mouth
and throat are dry, and, when words
came, they were but a whisper.
<q>O father!</q> she said, <q>don't go
in there if you have any human
weakness left in you! You have
to be an angel and not a man to
hear my husband's confession.
Find some one else for him. He
will not speak to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Never fear, child!</q> he answered
firmly. <q>I may have human weakness,
but I have the strength of
God to help me resist it.</q>
</p>

<p>
She watched him as he softly
opened the door of the chamber
where her husband lay, heard the
faint cry that greeted him: <q>Not
you! not you!</q> then the door
closed, and she was alone again.
</p>

<p>
The priest approached the bed,
and spoke with gentleness, yet
with authority: <q>F. O'Donovan
is too sick to come; and if you
wait for another to be sent for, it
will be too late. Think of your
soul, and let everything else go.
In a few hours you may be in the
presence of God, listening to your
eternal doom. What will you care
then, my poor boy, who helped you
to loosen from your conscience the
sins you have committed in this
<pb n='088'/><anchor id='Pg088'/>
miserable world? It cannot be
because you hate me so much, this
unwillingness. Is it because your
sins have been so great? There is
no sin that I have not heard confessed,
I think; and the greater it
was, the greater was my comfort
and thankfulness that at last it was
forgiven. Come, now, I am putting
on my stole. Ask the help of God
and of our Blessed Mother, and
forget who I am. Remember only
what I am&mdash;the minister of the merciful
God&mdash;and that I have no
feeling, no thought, no wish, but to
save you.</q>
</p>

<p>
The bed-curtains made a still
deeper shade in that shadowed
room, and out from the dimness
the face of the sick man gleamed
white and wild.
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot!</q> he said. <q>You would
not want to hear me if you knew.
You would never give me absolution.
You do not know what my
sins are.</q>
</p>

<p>
The priest seated himself by the
bedside, and took in his strong,
magnetic hand the thin and shaking
hand of the penitent. <q>No
matter what you may tell me, you
cannot surprise me,</q> he said.
<q>Though you should have committed
sacrilege and every crime, I
cannot, if I would, refuse you absolution.
And I would not wish to. I
have only pity and love for you.
Tell me all now, as if you were
telling your own soul. Have no
fear.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No priest ever before heard
such a confession!</q> The words
came faintly. <q>You do not know.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Confess, in the name of God!</q>
repeated the priest. <q>The flames
of hell are harder to bear than any
anger of mine can be. God has
sent me hither, and I have only to
obey him, and listen to your confession,
whatever it may be. It is
not my choice nor yours. We are
both commanded.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Promise me that I shall have
absolution! Promise me that you
will forgive me!</q> prayed the young
man, clinging to the hand that he
had at first shrunk from. <q>I didn't
mean to do what I have done, and
I have suffered the torments of the
damned for it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have no right to refuse absolution
when you are penitent,</q> was
the answer. <q>The person who repents
and confesses has a right to
absolution.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You will give it to me, no matter
what I may tell you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No matter what you may tell
me,</q> repeated the priest. <q>The
mercy of God is mighty. Though
you should hem yourself in with
sins as with a wall of mountains,
he can overlook them. Though
you should sink in the lowest
depths of sin, his hand can reach
you. A sinner cannot be moved
to call on the name of the Lord,
unless the Lord should move him
and have the merciful answer ready.
I have blessed you. How long is
it since your last confession?</q>
</p>

<p>
The sick man half raised himself,
and pointed across the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is a crucifix on the table,</q>
he said. <q>Go and kneel before
that, and ask God to strengthen
you for a hard trial. Then, if
you come back to me, I will confess.</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse started up, and
stood one instant erect and rigid,
with his face upraised. Then he
crossed the room, knelt before the
crucifix, and held it to his breast
during a moment of wordless prayer.
As a sigh reached him through
the stillness of the chamber, he laid
the crucifix down, and returned to
the bedside.
</p>

<p>
<q>In the name of God, confess,
<pb n='089'/><anchor id='Pg089'/>
and have no fear,</q> he said gently.
<q>Have no fear!</q>
</p>

<p>
The penitent lay with his face
half turned to the pillow, and the
bed was trembling under him; but
he no longer refused to speak.
</p>

<p>
To the company down-stairs it
seemed a very long interview. Mrs.
Ferrier, Mrs. Gerald, and Miss Pembroke,
kneeling together in the little
sitting-room near the foot of
the stairs, with the door open, had
said the rosary, trying not to let
their thoughts wander; then, sitting
silent, had listened for a descending
step, breathing each her own
prayer now and then. Their greatest
trouble was over. Evidently F.
Chevreuse had overcome Lawrence
Gerald's unwillingness to confess to
him; and the three women, so different
in all else, united in the one
ardent belief that the prayer of
faith would save the sick man, and
that, when his conscience should be
quite disburdened, and his soul enlightened
by the comforts and exhortations
which such a man as F.
Chevreuse could offer, his body
would feel the effects of that inward
healing, and throw off its burden
too.
</p>

<p>
In an adjoining room sat Louis
Ferrier, biting his nails, having been
forbidden by his mother to seek
distraction in more cheerful scenes.
He watched the women while they
knelt, and even drew a little nearer
to listen to their low-voiced prayer,
but lacked the piety to join
them. He was both annoyed and
frightened by the gloomy circumstances
in which he found himself,
and, like most men of slack religious
belief and practice, felt more safe
to have pious women by him in
times of danger.
</p>

<p>
John had taken his place on a
low stool underneath the stairs,
and had an almost grotesque appearance
of being at the same time
hiding and alert. With his head
advanced, and his neck twisted, he
stared steadfastly up the stairway
at the door within which the priest
had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
For nearly an hour there was no
sound but the small ticking of a
clock and the occasional dropping
of a coal in the grate. Then all
the waiting ones started and looked
out eagerly; for the chamber-door
opened, and F. Chevreuse came out.
</p>

<p>
One only did not lift her face to
read what tidings might be written
in the face of him who came forth
from the sick-chamber. Kneeling,
almost prostrate on the floor, Annette
Gerald still remained where
F. Chevreuse had left her. She
did not look up even when he
paused by her side, and she felt
that he was blessing her, but only
bowed still lower before him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Take comfort, my child,</q> he
said. <q>You have no reason to despair.</q>
</p>

<p>
She looked up quickly into his
face, with an almost incredulous
hope in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
He was pale, but some illumination
not of earth floated about him,
so that she could easily have believed
she saw him upborne in air with the
buoyancy of a spirit. The heavenly
calm of his expression could not
be described; yet it was the calm
of one who, reposing on the bosom
of God, is yet aware of infinite sin
and suffering in the world. It was
such a look as one might imagine
an angel guardian to wear&mdash;heavenly
peace shorn of heavenly delight.
</p>

<p>
He motioned her to rise, and she
obeyed him. She would not then
have hesitated, whatever he had
bade her do. His imposing calm
pressed her fears and doubts to a
perfect quiet. There was nothing
possible but obedience.
</p>

<pb n='090'/><anchor id='Pg090'/>

<p>
<q>Go to your husband, and see if
he wants anything,</q> he said. <q>Let
him be very quiet, and he may
sleep. To-morrow morning I shall
bring him the Viaticum; but I think
he will recover.</q>
</p>

<p>
She went toward the chamber,
and he descended the stairs. John,
bending forward eagerly, caught
sight of his face, and drew quickly
back again, blessing himself. <q>The
man is a saint!</q> he muttered, and
took good care to keep himself out
of sight.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse was met in the sitting-room
door by Mrs. Gerald,
and the other two pressed close behind
her; and when they saw him, it
was as though a soft and gentle light
had shone into their troubled faces.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are afraid that so long an
interview has exhausted him,</q> he
said. <q>It has not. The body is
seldom any worse for attending to
the affairs of the soul, and a tranquil
mind is the best rest. Annette
is with him now, and, if left undisturbed,
I think he will sleep. Pray
for him, and do not lose courage.
God bless you! Good-night.</q>
</p>

<p>
Not one of them uttered a word.
The questions they would have asked,
and the invitation they would
have given the priest to remain with
them, died on their lips. Evidently
he did not mean to enter the
room, and they felt that his doing
so was a favor for him to offer, not
for them to ask.
</p>

<p>
They glanced at each other as he
went away, and Honora Pembroke
smiled. <q>He looks as though he
were gazing at heaven through the
gate of martyrdom,</q> she said.
</p>

<p>
But the next morning, after seeing
Gerald, he stopped a few minutes
to talk with the family, and still
they found that indefinable air of loftiness
lingering about him, imposing
a certain distance, at the same time
that it increased their reverence
and affection for him. The familiar,
frequently jesting, sometimes
peremptory F. Chevreuse seemed
to have gone away for ever; but
how beautiful was the substitute he
had left, and how like him in all
that was loftiest!
</p>

<p>
Lawrence was better that morning,
and gained steadily day by day.
Nothing could exceed the care and
tenderness with which F. Chevreuse
watched over his recovery. He
came every morning and evening,
he treated him with the affection
of a father, and seemed to have
charged himself with the young
man's future.
</p>

<p>
<q>I think you should let him and
Annette go to Europe for a year,</q>
he said to Mrs. Ferrier. <q>It would
be better for him to break off entirely
from old associations, and
have an entire change for a while.
His health has not been good for
some time, and his nerves are worn.
The journey would restore him,
and afterward we will see what can
be done. I am not sure that it is
well for him to live here. When a
person is going to change his life
very much, it is often wiser to
change his place of abode also.
The obstacles to improvement are
fewer among strangers.</q>
</p>

<p>
The young man received this
proposal to go abroad rather doubtfully.
He would not go away till
spring, and was not sure that he
would go then. As he grew better
in health, indeed, he withdrew himself
more and more from the priest,
and showed an uneasiness in his
society which not all F. Chevreuse's
kindness could overcome.
</p>

<p>
<q>You must not shun me, Lawrence,</q>
the priest said to him one
day when they were alone. <q>You
have done that too long, and it is
not well. Try to look on me as
<pb n='091'/><anchor id='Pg091'/>
very firmly your friend. Let me
advise you sometimes, and be sure
that I shall always have your good
in view.</q>
</p>

<p>
Lawrence had been very nervous
and irritable that day, and was in no
mood to bear expostulation. <q>You
can't be my friend,</q> he replied
with suppressed vehemence. <q>You
can only be my master. You can
only own me body and soul.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is a mistake,</q> was the
quiet answer. <q>I do not own you
any more than I do others.</q>
</p>

<p>
But he patiently forbore to press
the question then.
</p>

<p>
<q>Encourage him to come to me
whenever you think I can benefit
him,</q> he said to Annette. <q>You
can tell best. He has not quite recovered
his spirits yet, and it will
do no good for me to urge him.
Make everything as cheerful as you
can for him. It sometimes happens
that people get up from sickness in
this depressed state of mind.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes!</q> she replied, looking
down.
</p>

<p>
She also had grown shy of F.
Chevreuse, and seemed willing to
keep out of his sight.
</p>

<p>
But to others she was perhaps
rather more gay than they had
known her for some time. Her
mother found her at once kinder
and more exacting, and complained
that they seemed now to have become
strangers.
</p>

<p>
<q>And how nervous you have
grown, Annette!</q> she said. <q>You
crush everything you take hold
of.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What have I crushed, mamma?</q>
asked the daughter, with a light
laugh. <q>Have I made havoc
among your bonnets or wine-glasses?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It isn't that,</q> Mrs. Ferrier said
fretfully. <q>You squeeze people's
hands, instead of touching them.
Look at that baby's arm!</q> They
were entertaining a baby visitor.
</p>

<p>
Annette Gerald looked as she
was bid and saw the prints of her
fingers on the soft little arm she
had held unconsciously, and caught
an only half-subsided quiver of the
baby lip as the little one looked at
her, all ready to cry with pain.
</p>

<p>
Every woman knows at once
how she atoned for her fault, by
what caresses, and petting, and protestations
of sorrow, and how those
faint red marks were bemoaned as
if they had been the stripes of a
martyr.
</p>

<p>
<q>If you touch any one's arm, you
pinch it,</q> the elder lady went on.
<q>And you take hold of your shawl
and your gloves and your handkerchief
as if somebody were going to
pull them away from you. I've
seen your nails white when you
held the evening paper to read, you
gripped it so; and as to taking
glasses and cups at the table, I
always expect to see them fly to
pieces in your hands.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Isn't she an awful woman?</q>
says Mrs. Annette to the baby,
holding it high and looking up
into its rosy, smiling face. <q>Isn't
Annette a frightfully muscular and
dangerous person, you pink of perfection?
What shall we do with
her? She pinches little swan's-down
arms, and makes angelic babies
pucker up their lips with grief,
and sets tears swimming in their
blue violets of eyes. We must do
something dreadful to her. We must
forgive her; and that is very terrible.
There is nothing so crushing, baby,
as to be forgiven very much.</q>
</p>

<p>
And then, after one more toss,
the infant was let suddenly and
softly down, like a lapful of roses,
over the face of its friend, and for
an instant Annette Gerald's eyes
were hidden in its neck.
</p>

<pb n='092'/><anchor id='Pg092'/>

<p>
<q>Come and have a game of chess,
Annette,</q> her husband called out
across the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, dear!</q> she responded
brightly; and, setting the child
down, went to him at once, a red
color in her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do some people always
notice such little things,</q> he said
frowningly, <q>and, instead of attending
to themselves, watch how
people take hold of cups and
saucers, and all that nonsense, and
fancy that some wonderful chance
hangs on your eating butter with
your bread, or preferring cheese?</q>
</p>

<p>
Annette was engaged in placing
the men, and did not look in her
husband's face as she answered in
a gentle, soothing voice:
</p>

<p>
<q>It is rather annoying sometimes,
but I find the best way is to
treat the whole jestingly. If one
shows vexation, it looks serious.
But you can ridicule a person out
of hanging mountains by threads.</q>
</p>

<p>
He was going to answer, when
something made him notice her
face. The color was still bright
there, but the cheeks were hollow,
and dark circles had sunk beneath
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, you are not looking well,</q>
he said, only just aware of the fact.
<q>Are you sick? Did you get
worn out taking care of me?</q>
</p>

<p>
She waited an instant till the
others, who were leaving the room,
should be out of sight, then leaned
across the table, careless that her
sleeve swept away the two armies
she had just placed, and took her
husband's hand in hers, and bowed
her cheek to it with a sob.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Lawrence! Lawrence!</q> she
whispered.
</p>

<p>
He made a motion to draw his
hand away, but let it remain.
<q>My God! what is the matter with
you?</q> he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
She leaned back instantly, and
made an effort to control herself.
<q>It must be that I am not well.
Don't mind me. And now, you
will have to place your own men,
and give me the first move.</q>
</p>

<p>
He placed the men, and appeared
to be thinking pitifully of his
wife as he glanced now and then
into her face. <q>It seems selfish of
me not to have taken better care
of you, Annette,</q> he said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! you needed care yourself,</q>
she replied lightly. <q>Don't imagine
that I am sick, though. It is
nothing. You didn't marry me to
take care of me, you know, and I
am not very exacting.</q>
</p>

<p>
She would have caught back the
last words, if she could, before it
was too late. They escaped her
unawares, and were a remembered,
rather than a present, bitterness.
</p>

<p>
He blushed faintly. <q>Whatever I
married you for, I have no desire
to exchange you now for any one
else,</q> he said, moving a pawn sideways
instead of forward. <q>If you
were ever so poor, I wouldn't want
a rich girl in your place. But then,
you know, I'm not sentimental. I
never was much so, and it's all
over now. I'm thirty years old,
and I feel a hundred. I can't remember
being young. I can't remember
being twenty years of age. I
wish to God I could!</q> he burst forth.
</p>

<p>
His wife made a careful move,
and said, <q>I have a presentiment
that I shall give you check in three
moves more. Look out for your
queen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My only romance,</q> he went on,
<q>was about Honora. I thought
that I could do and be anything, if
she would only care about me.
What a stately, floating creature
she always was! I used to think
she looked as if she could walk on
clouds and not fall through. Yes,</q>
<pb n='093'/><anchor id='Pg093'/>
he sighed, <q>that is where she belongs&mdash;among
the clouds. I never
blamed her for not having me; she
was too good. I never was worthy
of such a woman.</q>
</p>

<p>
Slowly, while he spoke, the bright
blood had deepened in his wife's
face, and swept over her forehead.
Had he been less preoccupied, he
would have seen the slight, haughty
movement with which she drew
herself up. It was only when he
had waited a moment for her to
move that he glanced up and met
her eyes fixed on him with an expression
very like indignant scorn.
</p>

<p>
<q>By what strange contradiction
is it, I wonder,</q> she said coldly,
<q>that the woman who does most
for a man, and is most merciful and
charitable toward him, is never too
good for him, while the one who
scorns him, and will not come a step
off her pedestal to save him, is always
the ideal woman in his eyes?</q>
</p>

<p>
Bitter tears of utter grief and
mortification welled up and wet
her eyelashes. <q>In another world,</q>
she said, <q>when the faults and mistakes
of this are set right, you may
think yourself worthy of the companionship
of Honora Pembroke,
and of any union and closeness of
affection which that life may know.
And then she may be given to you.
And, Lawrence, if she would and
could consent to take you now, I
would not refuse to give you up.
At this moment, if, without any
wrong, I could see her enter the
room, and hold out her hand to
you, and tell you that she was
ready to take what she had refused,
and be to you all that you could
wish&mdash;if it could be right that it
should happen so, I would not utter
one word of objection. I would
leave you to her without a moment's
hesitation.</q>
</p>

<p>
While she spoke, his hand had
played tremblingly with the chessmen
before him. <q>So you give me
up too,</q> he said in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
Her proud face softened. She
looked at him, and recollected herself
and him, and pity sprang up
again and effaced indignation. <q>I
do not give you up, Lawrence,</q> she
said gently. <q>I cannot and have
no wish to; I only spoke of what I
would do in circumstances which
cannot take place. You had insulted
me, without intending to, I
know, and it was but natural that I
should retort. You know that I
would not leave you, nor give you
up on any provocation. If you
should leave me, I should follow
you, because I should feel sure that
you would sooner or later need me.
We are one. You are mine; and
I always stand by my own.</q>
</p>

<p>
He looked at her with an expression
at once penetrating and shrinking.
<q>You would stand by me,
Annette, whatever should happen?</q>
he asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly!</q> she replied, but
did not meet his eyes. <q>There is
no imaginable circumstance which
could make me desert you. And
now, what of this game? To your
queen!</q>
</p>

<p>
He made a motion to save his
queen, then pushed the board aside.
<q>I cannot play,</q> he said; <q>I cannot
confine my mind to it. Sing
me something. It is long since
I have heard you sing.</q>
</p>

<p>
He threw himself into a deeply-cushioned
chair, and leaned his
head on his hands while she sang
to him&mdash;knowing, how well! that a
cheerful song would not cheer him
nor a pious song soothe&mdash;of

She was a magical singer, surely;
and the still, cold melancholy of
her tones was the very spirit and
essence of death; and, like death,
it pierced to the heart. She sang:

She turned quickly at a sound
behind her, and saw that her husband
had buried his face in the
cushions of the chair, and was
trembling violently. She went to
him, but there was no comfort to
give nor to receive. Death alone
could bring release for him and for
her. She could only surround him
with her arms while he sobbed with
the terrible hysterical sobbing of a
man utterly broken down, and let
him feel that he was not alone and
unpitied.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know what ails me,</q> he
said at length, trying to control
himself. <q>Don't mind me, Annette.
My nerves seem to be all unstrung.
It must be that fever.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! don't, Lawrence; please
don't!</q> she said faintly.
</p>

<p>
He became silent all at once, and
it seemed as though a chill had passed
over him. She sighed drearily,
and smoothed his hair with her hand.
<q>Trust your wife,</q> she said. <q>I
am by you always.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are not afraid of me?</q> He
seemed to ask the question with a
kind of terror.
</p>

<p>
<q>My poor Lawrence! no. I do
not fear you as much as you do me.
Don't have such fancies.</q>
</p>

<p>
She did not explain in what confessional
she had learned his secret;
in what troubled sleep wherein the
unwary tongue speaks; in what
more troubled waking, when the eyes
and actions speak; or in what sudden
suspicion and enlightenment,
coming she knew not whence. She
told nothing, and he asked nothing,
only leaned on her bosom, and
wept again as though all his manhood
had departed.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Annette!</q> he said, <q>I
dreamed last night that I was a
little boy, and that I stood by my
mother while she brushed my hair
into curls round her finger. I
thought I had been away a long
distance, and come back again, and
I stood quite still, and remembered
another childhood before I took
that journey. I was so glad to be
back&mdash;as glad as I should be now if
I could go back. Some way I could
see that my hair was golden, and
that my mother smiled as she brushed
it, though I did not look at her.
Such dreams are always coming to
me now. As soon as I go to sleep,
I am a child that has been away
and is solemnly glad to be back
again. And then I wake, and am
in hell!</q>
</p>

<p>
She went on smoothing his hair
steadily.
</p>

<p>
<q>Some time soon the dream will
come true,</q> she said. <q>Do the
best you can. Do justice to the
wronged. Come away with me,
and we will hide ourselves somewhere
in the world, and try to find
peace for the days that are left.
And by-and-by, Lawrence, will
come the day when we shall both
be as little children again, and all
our terrible burdens will slip off.
You must do justice to the wronged.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In some way, yes!</q> he said.
<q>I have tried to think. He must
be saved. But I cannot go away.
Do you remember ever having been
afraid to go up-stairs in the dark,
of having felt sure that there was
some one behind just ready to
grasp you, till you screamed out in
<pb n='095'/><anchor id='Pg095'/>
terror? It would be like that with
me. If once I turn my back on
this place, my life will become a
crazy flight.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The world is wide,</q> she urged,
<q>and there are safe places
enough in it. Besides, money can
buy anything; and <emph>he</emph> has forgiven
you. <emph>He</emph> will screen you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My mother!</q> he exclaimed.
<q>Who will screen and save her?
I will not destroy her, Annette.
No, everybody in the world may
perish first. I never will destroy
my mother. I have done harm
enough.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He will die in prison,</q> she
whispered. <q>He has sent to Germany
for help, and it did him no
good. He has demanded a new
trial, and there was not enough to
justify them in granting it. He is
in a net from which there seems to
be no escape. They say that he
will die.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You want to make me crazy!</q>
her husband cried out, pushing her
fiercely from him. <q>Go away!
You are worse than the rest.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was no way but to yield to
him. <q>Well, well, Lawrence! I will
try to think of some other means.</q>
</p>

<p>
The season had reached early
spring, and one tempestuous evening
in March, as F. Chevreuse sat
at home, making up some church
accounts, feeling quite sure that he
should not be interrupted, he heard
the street-door softly open and shut,
then a tap at the door of the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>Strange that Jane should leave
that street-door unlocked!</q> he
thought, and at the same moment
heard the servant coming up-stairs
from the kitchen. Her quick ear
had caught the sound, and she, too,
was wondering how she could have
omitted to fasten the house up.
</p>

<p>
The door of F. Chevreuse's sitting-room
was quickly opened, and
shut again in Jane's face, and a
woman stood inside. It was Annette
Gerald, wrapped in a large
waterproof cape, with the hood over
her head.
</p>

<p>
<q>Send Jane away!</q> she said
hurriedly. <q>Don't let her in here!
Don't let her see me!</q>
</p>

<p>
Here Jane opened the door and
put her head in, eyeing curiously
the visitor, whose back was turned
to her. <q>I'm sure I shut the door
and bolted it, father,</q> she began,
and took a step into the room.
<q>I....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No matter! I'll see to it,</q> the
priest said, waving her away.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! well, only I'm sure I locked
it. And perhaps you'd like to
have this lamp....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Jane!</q> he exclaimed, standing
up, <q>when I dismiss you, you are
to go.</q>
</p>

<p>
Jane retired, grumbling.
</p>

<p>
<q>She will listen at the door,</q> his
visitor said.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse flung the door open,
and discovered his domestic lingering
about the head of the stairs, affecting
to examine an imaginary
hole in the carpet.
</p>

<p>
<q>Once for all, Jane,</q> he said,
<q>if you wish to remain in my house,
you must not presume, nor show
any curiosity about my affairs, nor
the affairs of those who come to
me. Go down into the kitchen,
and shut the door, and stay there.</q>
</p>

<p>
Jane, albeit not very subordinate,
was completely awed by a display
of authority such as she had never
seen before. She did not venture
to resist nor complain, but returned
without delay to her own place.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse waited till he heard
the kitchen-door close with somewhat
unnecessary force, then returned
to his visitor.
</p>

<p>
<q>What has brought you out to-night?</q>
he asked in a low voice.
</p>

<pb n='096'/><anchor id='Pg096'/>

<p>
<q>Let me get my breath!</q> She
was almost gasping. <q>Jane gave
me such a fright that my heart is in
my mouth.</q>
</p>

<p>
He set a chair for her, and seated
himself near, waiting till she should
be able to speak. <q>You had better
shake the snow off your cloak,</q> he
said.
</p>

<p>
She made a gesture of impatient
refusal.
</p>

<p>
The rude mantle had slipped
aside, and revealed a strangely
contrasting toilet beneath. There
was a shining of lustrous pale-green
silk with delicately-wrought laces,
a glimmer of emeralds and diamonds,
and glimpses of pink roses
set in bunches of green grass.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have been to the prison,</q> she
whispered.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse frowned, and dropped
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>The man is a fool!</q> she exclaimed.
<q>He will not be saved. I had
bought one of the guard. It was
the hour for supper, and the man
let me in, and promised that for ten
minutes I might do as I pleased,
and he would see and know nothing.
I went into the corridor, and found
the cell-door unlocked. Everything
was ready, was perfect; for
the storm would prevent any loungers
from coming about the prison
or the guard-room, and would give
an excuse to any one who wanted
to muffle up and cover their face.
I had a large cloak all ready. But
he would not go. He will not fly
as though he were guilty, he said.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What did you say to him?</q> the
priest inquired, without looking up.
</p>

<p>
<q>I told him that he could save
himself, and prove his innocence
afterward. I said that may be the
real criminal would some day confess,
and then he could come out
before the world more than justified.
I said that we loved and
pitied him, and were unhappy at the
thought of him there, and would do
anything for him. He was to be
secreted in our house till a way
could be got for him to escape. I
had left the carriage just round
the corner, and John would have
thought that it was Lawrence who
got in with me. Mamma and
Louis have gone to the President's
dinner, and Gerald was to watch
and let us in, and afterward come
out again with me. But, no; the
stubborn simpleton would not be
saved. I went on my knees to
him, and he was like a rock. Then
the watchman knocked at the door,
and I had to run. The other guard
were coming in from their supper,
and, if I hadn't hid behind a door,
they would have seen me face to
face. Oh! why did he not consent?</q>
</p>

<p>
She wrung her hands slowly till
the jewels on them twinkled in the
lamp-light.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse still sat with his
eyes downcast. <q>My poor child!</q>
he said, <q>your pity for this man
has led you into an almost fatal
error. Never attempt such a thing
again. It is not for you to cast
yourself under the wheels of Juggernaut.
I command you to try no
such experiment again. Pray to
God. That is all that you can
do.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I know that now,</q> she
answered despairingly. <q>I am
utterly helpless. It is your turn.
You must save him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What can I do?</q> he asked
wonderingly. <q>I have tried all I
could, but in vain, as you know.
I have left no stone unturned, and
the only good result I can see is a
probability that the sentence will
not be executed to the utmost, and
that in time something may happen
to bring his innocence to light.</q>
</p>

<pb n='097'/><anchor id='Pg097'/>

<p>
<q>In time!</q> she repeated. <q>Have
you seen the man? Why, I did
not know him till he spoke. He
will not live. No, there must be
no delay. What you must do is
this: You must go to the authorities,
and say that you know who
the true criminal is, but cannot tell,
at least not now, and that Mr.
Schöninger is innocent.</q>
</p>

<p>
The priest looked in her face
with a gaze of calm surprise.
<q>You mistake,</q> he said. <q>I do not
know who the criminal is. If I did
know, I should immediately go to
the authorities, and denounce him.</q>
</p>

<p>
She looked him steadfastly in the
face, but his calmness baffled her.
He showed only a cool and dignified
surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! these men,</q> she muttered.
<q>I feel as if I were being
ground between stones.</q>
</p>

<p>
She stood, and the shining folds
of her dress, that had been gathered
up in her arms, dropped about
her, and lay on the floor.
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you been walking through
the snow in a ball-dress?</q> the
priest asked. <q>Have you anything
to protect your feet?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! I have fur shoes, and
my carriage is near by,</q> she said
absently, and seemed to be considering
what to do next.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go home now, my child, and
try to put all this wild work out of
your mind,</q> F. Chevreuse said
with emotion. <q>Perform your own
duty simply and in the fear of God,
and do not try to take the burden
of others on those shoulders of
yours. Go home and warm yourself
well, or you will be sick.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! I am not going home,</q>
she said, her glance caught by the
sparkling of a bracelet on her arm.
<q>To-night is a dinner and ball given
to the President, you know; and
since he is going away to-morrow
it couldn't be put off. It must be
time I was there, and I have to go
home after Lawrence.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What! you will go to a dinner
and ball to-night?</q> exclaimed the
priest. <q>You feel yourself fit for
company?</q>
</p>

<p>
She smiled faintly. <q>I shall doubtless
be the gayest of the gay.
There is not much danger of my
feeling sleepy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, women are wonderful
beings,</q> remarked F. Chevreuse to
himself.
</p>

<p>
The young woman drew her
wrappings about her, and gathered
up again her flowing skirts, looking
to see that no stain had fallen
on them; and, in arranging her
toilet for a new scene, she appeared
to arrange her mind also. A
gentle tranquillity settled upon her
face, and her head was slightly
lifted, as though she were already
the centre of observation to a brilliant
throng.
</p>

<p>
<q>But you are looking very pale,</q>
the priest objected.
</p>

<p>
<q>That always mends itself,</q> she
answered carelessly. <q>When I have
need of color, it usually comes.</q>
</p>

<p>
Some way, in this firm self-control,
he found her more pitiful than
in any abandonment of sorrow.
She accepted the situation uncomplainingly,
since she could do no
more, and steeled herself to bear
what she must.
</p>

<p>
<q>God bless you!</q> he said, when
she was ready to go.
</p>

<p>
Her face stirred a little at the
words. It seemed that she would
rather not listen to anything of serious
kindness then. Yet at the
door she hesitated, and turned back.
For once it was necessary that she
should speak.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have no difficulty about company
or anything but silence and
darkness,</q> she said hurriedly, looking
<pb n='098'/><anchor id='Pg098'/>
down. <q>I like a crowd, though
I am always on the lookout for
something to be said I will not wish
to hear. When he and I are alone,
I turn cold and creeping, for fear he
should speak; and I keep close and
cling to him, lest, if I should get a
little way off, I should grow afraid
of him. If we were to be separated
for one week, I think we would
never again dare to approach each
other. But recollect</q>&mdash;she lifted
her eyes for one quick glance&mdash;<q>I
have told you nothing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly not,</q> he replied
gravely.
</p>

<p>
In a moment she had gone out,
and was running through the flying
snow to find her carriage, left in the
next street to baffle some possible
watcher.
</p>

<p>
Young Mrs. Gerald was quite
right in saying that she should probably
be the gayest of the gay that
night; and if any other person appeared
to enjoy the scene more than
herself, it was, perhaps, her husband.
</p>

<p>
<q>A very happy couple,</q> remarked
a sympathizing friend to Mrs.
Ferrier.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! yes,</q> the mother sighed,
nodding her head. <q>He is always
gay when he is doing no good, and
as glum as a spade when he is behaving
himself. I was in hopes
that his sickness would sober him,
but he is wilder than ever. You
should see him drive my horses!</q>
</p>

<p>
Her son-in-law, passing by at
that moment, caught the last words,
and immediately joined the two
ladies. <q>I know that Mrs. Ferrier
is complaining of me,</q> he said gaily.
<q>She will never forgive me for putting
her precious bays out of breath.
But the truth is, I am trying to save
their lives; for they are so fat now
that you could drive them to death
at six miles an hour.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O Lawrence!</q> Annette said at
his elbow&mdash;she was always hovering
near when he spoke with her mother&mdash;<q>they
say that Strauss, the composer,
you know, is really coming
to America next year, and will lead
his own waltzes at the concerts.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And, by the way, Ninon,</q> said
her husband, <q>is that the Strauss
who always was? I have had a
waltz-writing, violin-playing Strauss
in my mind ever since I was born,
and he had lived ages before, and
was something like Mephistopheles,
to my fancy. Perhaps he is the
Wandering Jew.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Speaking of Jews&mdash;</q> began Mrs.
Ferrier's companion.
</p>

<p>
And here Annette drew her husband
away, hanging on his arm,
smiling and whispering to him, the
brightest, prettiest woman in the
room.
</p>

<p>
<q>And yet last night he was off
somewhere, and she sat up for him
till a quarter before two o'clock,</q>
Mrs. Ferrier said, looking after
them. <q>I looked to see what time
it was when I heard him come in.
It is wearing her out. I shall not
allow her to do it again.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was easier for Mrs. Ferrier to
say what should not be than to find
herself obeyed, for the next night
her daughter again kept vigil. <q>All
I ask of you, mamma, is to let me
attend to my own business,</q> she
said decidedly.
</p>

<p>
So <q>mamma</q> toiled up-stairs to
bed, and the daughter lowered the
lights, took out her rosary, and began
her nightly task of fighting away
thought, and trying to fix her mind
on the future.
</p>

<p>
After an hour or two, John, the
footman, put his head in at the
door. <q>You'd a great deal better
go to bed, ma'am, and leave me to
let Mr. Gerald in,</q> he said. <q>I've
something that will keep me up to-night,
<pb n='099'/><anchor id='Pg099'/>
and it's a pity two should lose
their rest. It is past twelve now.</q>
</p>

<p>
She felt faint and weary, and
sleep was beginning to steal over
her. <q>I believe I will go, then,</q>
she said. <q>I have not slept for
three nights.</q>
</p>

<p>
She went, with a dragging step,
over the bright carpet roses. <q>What
would become of him if I were
to break up?</q> she thought.
</p>

<p>
When she had gone, the man put
out the hall gas, opened the doors
of the vestibule, and set himself to
wait. He meant to have speech
of Mr. Gerald that night without
Mr. Gerald's wife for a witness or
any likelihood of other interruption.
</p>

<p>
About one o'clock he heard unsteady
steps on the sidewalk, and, as
he went to the door, Lawrence Gerald
came reeling up the steps, and
almost fell into his arms.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come into the sitting-room, sir,
and lie down on the sofa. It will
be easier than going up-stairs,</q> he
said.
</p>

<p>
When he had been drinking, the
young man was easy to lead, and
he now submitted readily, and was
in a few minutes in a deep sleep.
</p>

<p>
John locked the street-door, shut
the door of the sitting-room behind
him, and, seating himself, waited for
the sleeper to wake.
</p>

<p>
A nervous man might have grown
uneasy during that watch. There
is something not always pleasant in
hearing one's own breathing, and
the faint occasional sounds in floor
and wall, and at one's elbow, even,
which, in the stillness of night, seem
like the movements of unseen beings
drawing near. Besides, there
is a terror in the thought that we
are going to terrify another.
</p>

<p>
But this man was not nervous.
He was made of wholesome though
rough material, and he had a strong
will. He had been waiting for
others to act, and had waited in
vain, and now he had made up his
mind that it was for him to act.
Justice was strong in him, where he
had the ability to perceive what
was just, and he would no longer
see the innocent suffer for the guilty.
Besides, he reflected, there was
no one else who could speak. Self-defence,
or the defence of one dearly
loved, or a yet more sacred motive,
sealed the lips of all who knew.
His lips were not sealed, and justice
commanded him to speak.
</p>

<p>
Three o'clock came and went,
and still the young man slept. The
other sat and studied him, noting
how slight and elegant was his
form, how fine the hands and feet,
how daintily he was dressed and
cared for.
</p>

<p>
John was stout and heavy, a man
of delf, and the size of his boots
had once provoked from Lawrence
a very provoking quotation:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<lg>
<l><q>What dread hand formed thy dread feet?</q></l>
</lg>

</quote>

<p>
and more than once the young man
had mockingly pushed his two
white hands into one of John's
gloves.
</p>

<p>
This sleeper's hair was glossy,
scented, as soft as floss, and curled
in many a wilful ring; John's was
coarse and straight, and he wisely
wore it closely cropped. Lawrence
Gerald's face was delicately
smooth; the lines melted harmoniously
into each other; his brows
were finely drawn; the teeth, that
showed through his parted lips,
were pearly white; and as he lay
with closed eyes, the lashes made
two exquisitely curved shadows
on his cheeks. John's face was
plain, he had no eyebrows nor eyelashes
to speak of, his eyes were
more for use than ornament, and
his nose went about its business
straight from end to end, stopping
<pb n='100'/><anchor id='Pg100'/>
rather bluntly, and utterly ignoring
that delicate curve which made this
man's profile so perfect.
</p>

<p>
This man? This drunkard, rather,
John thought; this spendthrift,
and gambler, and robber.
This murderer!
</p>

<p>
The nerves of the serving-man
stiffened; and if he had felt any relenting,
it was over. The insolent
daintiness before him stirred all his
bitterness. It was for such men as
this that humbler honest folks were
to bow and serve, and women's
hearts to break!
</p>

<p>
It must be nearly four o'clock,
he thought, and glanced round at
the clock. Looking back again, he
met Lawrence Gerald's eyes fixed
on him steadily, and he returned
the look with as immovable a
stare. In that instant the meaning
of each leaped out of his face as
clearly as lightning from a cloud.
Young Gerald's eyes began to
shrink in their depths, and still the
other held them; he drew slowly
back on the sofa, cowering, but unable
to turn away.
</p>

<p>
And here John's eyes released
him, for another object drew them
up to the mirror that hung over the
sofa. Reflected there he saw that
the door was partly open, and Annette
Gerald's white face looking
in. She came swiftly gliding toward
them, silent as a ghost, and
melted, rather than fell, on to her
knees before her husband, between
him and the other. Her arms and
bosom hid him from that relentless
gaze which told that all was
known, and her own face turned
and received it instead, firmly and
almost defiantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, John?</q> she said. <q>Speak
out what you have to say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This can't go on any longer,
ma'am,</q> he whispered; <q>and I
should think you would have the
sense to see that. If you're willing
to let an innocent man suffer for
him, even that won't serve you
long, for he will betray himself yet.
You must go.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes, we will go!</q> she replied
hurriedly. <q>It is the only
thing to do. We will go right
away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will give you three weeks to
get out of danger,</q> he went on;
<q>or, if that isn't enough, a month.
But you mustn't lose a day. I
won't see that man down in the
prison die for nothing. After the
four weeks from to-morrow morning
are up, I shall go to F. Chevreuse
with a paper that your husband
will write. He may tell his
own story, and make what excuses
he can for himself, and it shall be
for everybody to read. F. Chevreuse
will carry the paper to the
judges, and take that man out of
prison. That is all I've got to
say,</q> he concluded. <q>Four weeks
from to-morrow morning!</q>
</p>

<p>
Annette made no further reply,
only watched the man out of the
room, and locked the door after
him. Then she returned to her
husband, and, for the first time
since she had entered the room,
looked in his face. He was lying
back with his eyes closed, as though
from faintness. She brought him a
glass of wine, knelt by his side
while he drank it, then took his
hand in hers.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is no other way, Lawrence,</q>
she said.
</p>

<p>
He was sitting up now, but kept
his eyes closed, as if he could not
meet her glance, or could not endure
to look upon the light. He
answered her quietly, <q>Yes, it is the
only way.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And now,</q> she continued,
<q>since there is no time to lose, you
will tell me the whole, and I will
<pb n='101'/><anchor id='Pg101'/>
write it down. You can sign it
afterward.</q>
</p>

<p>
He nodded, but did not speak.
The blow had fallen, and its first
effect was crushing.
</p>

<p>
She brought a writing-table close
to the sofa, and seated herself before
it. As she arranged the paper,
pens, and ink, heavy tears rolled
down her face, and sigh after sigh
struggled up from her heart; but
she did not suffer them to impede
her work&mdash;scarcely seemed, indeed,
conscious of them. Everything
was arranged carefully and rapidly.
<q>Now, Lawrence!</q> she said, and
seemed to catch her breath with
the words.
</p>

<p>
He started, and opened his eyes;
and when he saw her, with eyes uplifted,
making the sign of the cross
on her forehead and bosom, he
knelt by her side, and, bowing his
head, blessed himself also with the
sacred sign.
</p>

<p>
Then he began his confession,
and she wrote it as it fell from his
lips. If now and then a tear, not
quickly enough brushed away, fell
on the paper, it only left its record
of a wife's grief and love, but did
not blot out a word of the clear
writing.
</p>

<p>
When the last word had been
written, and the name signed, a
long ray of white morning light had
pierced through a chink in the
shutter, and lay across the red
lamp-light.
</p>

<p>
Annette Gerald took the pen
from her husband's hand. <q>My
poor Lawrence!</q> she said, <q>you
and I have got to be saints now.
There is no medium for us. Pleasure,
ease, all hope of earthly peace&mdash;they
are far behind us. We must
go out into the world and do penance,
and wait for death.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Annette,</q> he exclaimed, <q>let
me go alone! Give me up now,
and live your own life here. I will
never come near you again.</q>
</p>

<p>
She shook her head. <q>That is
impossible. The only consolation
I can have is to stay with you and
give you what little help I can.
You could not live without me,
Lawrence. Don't speak of it. I
shall stand by you.</q>
</p>

<p>
She opened the shutters and the
window, and let the fresh morning
light into the close room and over
their feverish faces.
</p>

<p>
The town was waking up to a
bright sunshiny day, its many
smokes curling upward into the
blue, its beautiful vesture of snow
still clinging here and there, all its
busy life beginning to stir joyfully
again. They stood before the window
a minute looking out, the same
thought in both their minds. Then
the wife leaned forward. <q>Good-by,
Crichton!</q> she said, and took
her husband's hand. <q>Come, Lawrence!
we have no time to lose.
The sword has been set over the
gate.</q>
</p>

<p>
Perhaps there is no place in
London that appeals to so many
instincts of the soul as the Temple.
Religion, valor, romance, and literature
have all lent enchantment to
the place. Built and inhabited by
the Knights Templars, the resort
of kings and nobles of highest lineage,
the home of generations of law-students
and literary men like
Burke, Johnson, Goldsmith, and
Lamb, and associated with Shakespeare
and many a romance, who
could enter its quiet alleys, and
ramble about its courts and gardens,
without being stirred to the depths
of his soul? Fact and fiction are
here so mingled together that one
is unable to disentangle them, and
the visitor says, as he roams about:
Here was the place of Lamb's
<q>kindly engendure</q>; yonder Eldon
lived; up in that third story
was Arthur Pendennis' sick-chamber,
where his mother and Laura
went to nurse him; in that court
were Goldsmith's chambers, where
he loved to sit and watch the rooks;
and in those gardens walked Sir
Roger de Coverley, discussing the
belles, with patches and hoops,
strolling across the green once used
by the Red-Cross Knights for martial
exercises; and yonder is the ancient
church, patterned after that of
the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
The church must be visited first,
for it is the most beautiful and
perfect in existence that belonged
to the Knights Templars, and stood
next in rank to their temple in the
Holy City. Within half a century
it has been restored to something
of its ancient glory, and is substantially
the same as when consecrated
by Heraclius, Patriarch of
Jerusalem, in the year 1185. The
entrance is a beautiful Norman
arch, deeply recessed, with elaborately
wrought mouldings, and
columns between which are figures
of saintly forms, some with rolls in
their hands, and some in the attitude
of prayer. These stone faces at
the entrance of churches are a wonderful
check to worldly thoughts.
They communicate something of
their own solemnity and ineffable
calmness. Through this door-way
used to pass the valiant knights of
the cross who came here with their
banner&mdash;the glorious <hi rend='italic'>Beau-seant</hi>&mdash;to
have their swords blessed
on the altar before departing for

This is the entrance to the Round
Church. A circular tower rests on six
clustered columns of marble, each
composed of four shafts, which run
into each other at base and capital
so as to form but one. And around
<pb n='103'/><anchor id='Pg103'/>
these is a circular aisle. Six pointed
arches spring from these beautiful
pillars, above which is an arcade
of Norman arches so interlaced as
to form a combination of round
and pointed arches&mdash;a fine example
of the transition to the Gothic style
of architecture. Parker says this
Round Church is one of the best
authenticated instances of the
earliest use of the pointed arch
in England, though the choir of
Canterbury Cathedral is usually
considered so. Over this arcade
are six clerestory windows, between
which rise slender shafts that support
the groined ribs of the roof.
</p>

<p>
At the sides of the circular aisle
are sedilia formed of masonry
projecting from the wall, with
slightly arched recesses, in the
spandrels of which are grotesque
faces in <foreign rend='italic'>alto-relievo</foreign>, carven in stone,
each of which has an extraordinary
character of its own, and is
well worth studying. Some are
distorted with pain; some look up
appealingly; here the tongue protrudes
and the eyeballs are glaring;
there is a look of unutterable
horror; one sets his teeth hard as
an unclean animal bites his ear;
another shows two fang-like teeth,
while a vicious-looking creature is
gnawing the corner of his mouth,
and the furrowed brow expresses
awful agony; here is one with his
long tongue run out sideways;
there is another bellowing with his
mouth wide open, the nostrils
dilated and the forehead all puckered
up; some have ultra-Roman
noses, some sharp, and others flat
and broad, as if reflected from a
convex surface. One grins and
shows all his teeth broad and uniform.
The sexton says these faces
are supposed to depict the tortures
of the suffering souls in purgatory.
Grotesque as most of them are,
there is a certain awful solemnity,
even in the most hideous, that is
impressive. Thank God! a few are
calm and serene, with their crown
of sorrow on their heads. An
arcade, similarly decorated, has
been found in the ruined Temple
Church at Acre, and at the famous
Castel Pellegrino, erected by the
early Templars to command the
shore-road from Acre to Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
The first thing that strikes the
attention on entering this solemn
church is the group of old Crusaders
lying on the pavement with
their legs crossed, in token that they
had served in the Holy Land.

These are not effigies of the
Knights Templars&mdash;for they do not
wear the mantle of that order&mdash;but
knights associated with them in
defence of the Holy Land. One
of them represents William Marshall,
Earl of Pembroke, and Protector
of England during the minority of
Henry III., one of the greatest warriors
and statesmen of the middle
ages. Matthew Paris describes his
burial here in 1219. Here he lies,
carven in stone, clad from head to
foot in armor of chain-mail, in the
act of sheathing his sword. His
legs are crossed, for he had borne
the cross of Prince Henry, eldest
son of Henry II., to Jerusalem.
On his feet are spurs, and at his
side a shield with the lion rampant
of the Marshalls. This stout-hearted
supporter of the Plantagenets
was one of the council appointed
by Richard Cœur de Lion
to govern the kingdom during his
absence. It was he, together with
Americ, Master of the Temple, who
at last induced King John to sign
the Magna Charta, and he accompanied
the king to Runnymede.
</p>

<pb n='104'/><anchor id='Pg104'/>

<p>
He it was, too, that, while protector
in the next reign, offered pardon to
the disaffected barons, and confirmed
the Magna Charta. He also
extended its benefits to Ireland,
and commanded the sheriffs to
read it publicly at the county
courts, and enforce its exact observance.
</p>

<p>
It was this same Earl of Pembroke
whom Shakespeare represents
pleading so eloquently for
the enfranchisement of the unfortunate
Prince Arthur:

<p>
This great statesman was a benefactor
to the Templars, and, when
he died, his body was borne here
in state and buried with great
pomp on Ascension Day, 1219.
</p>

<p>
Here, too, are the monumental
effigies of his sons&mdash;William Marshall,
the younger, one of the bold
barons of Runnymede, to whom we
are indebted for the Magna Charta;
and Gilbert Marshall, <q>the flower
of the chivalry of that time,</q> who
married a Scotch princess, and went
to the defence of the sacred tomb.
</p>

<p>
Although the elder Marshall was
just enough to extend the benefits
of the Magna Charta to Ireland,
we are told that, during his campaign
in that country, he seized
the lands of the Bishop of Fernes,
and kept them, in spite of a sentence
of excommunication. After
the earl's death, the bishop came
to London, and laid the case before
the king, who, alarmed for the
weal of his old guardian's soul, accompanied
the bishop to his tomb.
</p>

<p>
Matthew Paris says that, as they
stood by it, the bishop solemnly
apostrophized the departed earl:
<q>O William! who lyest here interred
and held fast by the chain of
excommunication, if those lands
which thou hast unjustly taken
from my church be rendered back
to me by the king, or by your heir,
or by any of your family, and if
due satisfaction be made for the
loss and injury I have sustained, I
grant you absolution; but if not, I
confirm my previous sentence, so
that, enveloped in your sins, you
stand for evermore condemned to
hell!</q>
</p>

<p>
However alarmed the king might
have appeared about his guardian's
soul, restitution was not made, and
the stout old bishop, who seems to
have been soundly orthodox as to
the temporal rights of the church,
denounced the earl and his race in
right Scriptural phrase: <q>His name
shall be rooted out in one generation;
and his sons shall be deprived
of the blessing, <hi rend='italic'>Increase and multiply</hi>.
Some of them shall die a
miserable death; their inheritance
shall be scattered; and this thou,
O king! shalt behold in thy life-time;
yea, in the days of thy flourishing
youth.</q>
</p>

<p>
This fearful prophecy was fulfilled
in a remarkable manner. The
five sons of the protector died one
after another without issue in the
reign of Henry III., and the family
became extinct.
</p>

<p>
There are eight of these monumental
effigies lying in the centre
of the Round Church. It is to them
Butler refers in his <hi rend='italic'>Hudibras</hi>, speaking

In fact, there is a wonderful air

the tomb of Christ. And chief
among them the valiant Templars,

We can never believe that, as a
body, the early Templars were not
worthy of their white garments.
A bishop of Acre, who frequently
accompanied them on their military
expeditions, said of them:
<q>Lions they are in war, gentle in
the convent, fierce soldiers in the
field, hermits and monks in religion;
to the enemies of Christ ferocious
and inexorable, but to Christians
kind and gracious. They carry
before them to battle a banner,
half black and white, which they
call <foreign rend='italic'>Beau-seant</foreign>&mdash;that is to say, in the
Gallic tongue, <foreign rend='italic'>Bien-seant</foreign>, because
they are fair and favorable to the
friends of Christ, but black and
terrible to his enemies.</q>
</p>

<p>
While this vision of the past was
crossing the inward eye, a strain of
music, as of some holy chant, came
floating softly out from some inner
recess, sweetly adding to the enchantment.
It was only the choir
practising in the vestry, but it was
just far enough away to give a certain
mystery and softness to their
psalmody that was delightful at
that vesper hour. One needs a
service for such memories, and
alone in this rotunda of the Templars,

The next day brought him back
to complete his survey. Churches
like this, in imitation of that of the
Holy Sepulchre, were frequently
built in the time of the Crusades.
The Milanese built one in their
city after returning from the holy
war. Peter Adornes made three
journeys from Flanders to Jerusalem
to obtain an exact copy of the
Holy Sepulchre for the church at
Bruges; and at Abbeville, the
beautiful Church of the Holy Sepulchre
<pb n='106'/><anchor id='Pg106'/>
was built on the very spot
where Godfrey of Bouillon and the
Crusaders assembled before going
to Palestine. In it was built a
tomb before which the solemn Office
of the Holy Sepulchre was
celebrated annually. Sometimes
the Crusaders brought back with
them some of the dust of the Holy
City. At Pisa, and in Sicily, there
were cemeteries filled with that sacred
soil. It seemed less repulsive
to lie for ever down in dust perhaps
the Saviour's feet had trod.
</p>

<p>
The London temple has therefore
something of the sacred character
of the Orient about it; that
is, the Rotunda. And it was dedicated
to that holy Oriental maiden
whom all nations unite in calling
Blessed. The following inscription
is over the door of entrance:
</p>

<p>
<q>On the 10th of February, in the
year from the Incarnation of our
Lord 1185, this church was consecrated
in honor of the Blessed
Mary, by the Lord Heraclius, by
the grace of God Patriarch of the
Church of the Resurrection, who
hath granted an indulgence of fifty
days to those yearly seeking it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Heraclius had come to Europe
to preach the Third Crusade. In
Paris he was the first to officiate
at Notre Dame. His special mission
to England was to induce
Henry II. to fulfil his vow of going
to the succor of the Holy Land by
way of penance for the murder of
Thomas à Becket. Finding his efforts
in vain, the patriarch at last
said to the king: <q>Hitherto thou
hast reigned gloriously, but hereafter
thou shalt be forsaken of Him
whom thou at this time forsakest.
Think on him, what he hath given
to thee, and what thou hast yielded
to him again; how first thou wert
false to the King of France, and,
after, slew that holy man, Thomas
of Canterbury, and, lastly, thou forsakest
the protection of Christ's
faith.</q> The king, vexed at such
frankness, said: <q>Though all the
men of my land were one body, and
spake with one mouth, they durst
not speak to me such words.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No wonder,</q> replied the patriarch,
<q>for they love thine and not
thee; that is to mean, they love thy
goods temporal, and fear thee for
loss of promotion, but they love
not thy soul.</q> And so saying, he
bowed his head before the king,
and continued: <q>Do by me right
as thou didst by that holy man,
Thomas of Canterbury; for I had
rather be slain of thee than of the
Saracens, for thou art worse than
any Saracen.</q>
</p>

<p>
The king, restraining himself,
said: <q>I may not wend out of my
land, for mine own sons will rise up
against me when I were absent.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No wonder,</q> responded the patriarch,
<q>for of the devil they come,
and to the devil they shall go;</q> and
so departed, as Abbot Brompton
records, <q>in great ire.</q>
</p>

<p>
In the wall of the Round Church
is a winding staircase of stone leading
to the triforium. Part way up
it opens into what is called <q>the
penitential cell</q>&mdash;a recess in the
thick wall four feet and a half
long, and two and a half wide, with
two squints to admit air and light,
and enable the penitent to witness
the divine service. It would seem,
however much an active knight
might chafe in such restricted
quarters, as if he had much to console
and support him in looking
down into such a church. In the
triforium are gathered together
monuments that were formerly scattered
about the church. Among
them is a tablet to Edmundus Gibbon,
an ancestor of the historian,
who died in 1679.

The Round Church opens by
three lofty arches into the rectangular
church, consisting of a nave and
two aisles, formed by clustered pillars
of marble, supporting a groined
vault covered with rich arabesques.
This church is a beautiful specimen
of the early English style. The
lawyers of Cromwell's time whitewashed
the pillars, and did all they
could to obscure the beauty of the
building; but now it is restored to
somewhat of its former richness.
It is paved with tiles bearing the
arms of the Outer and Inner Temple,
and on its triple lancet windows are
emblazoned the arms of the Templars&mdash;the
lamb and flag and the
ruby cross. That red cross, in the
very church where it gleamed seven
hundred years ago, says volumes to
the heart. Where are the Knights
Templars now to assume it again,
and go to the rescue of the Holy
City, bereft of its sovereign lord?
Do we not need a new S. Bernard
to preach a new crusade in behalf
of the captive daughter of Zion, that
she may be delivered from the ungodly
oppressor, and her anointed
one set free?
</p>

<p>
It was an old English prelate&mdash;S.
Anselm&mdash;who said: <q>God loves
nothing in the world better than
the liberty of his church.... He
does not wish a servant for his
spouse.</q>
</p>

<p>
This rectangular church was consecrated
in 1240, in presence of the
king and a vast number of nobles.
In one corner is a beautiful old
marble piscina, lately brought to
light, where the priest, before the
holy oblation, purified the hands
that were to touch the Body of the
Lord.
</p>

<p>
On a terrace to the north of the
church is Goldsmith's grave, marked
by a coped stone. On one side
is graven: <q>Here lies Oliver
Goldsmith</q>; and on the other:
<q>Born 10 Nov., 1728. Died 4 April,
1774.</q> The row of houses close
by is marked <q>Goldsmith's Buildings.</q>
Perhaps on this very terrace
he walked up and down in his
bloom-colored coat, dreading to
have the bill sent in. There are
Johnson's buildings also. And in
Inner Temple Lane, Lamb lived at
No. 4, which <q>looks out on Hare
Court, with three trees and a pump,</q>
where he used to drink when he was
<q>a young Rechabite of six years</q>
of age. As he says, <q>it is worth
something to have been born in
such a place.</q> It was here the
spirit of the past was infused into
his mind, moulding it in antique
fashion, and planting the germs of
the quaint conceits and humorous
fancies that so delight us all, and
giving him a love for the old dramatists
which we have all learned
to share in.
</p>

<p>
Of course every one goes to drink
at the fountain which Lamb, when
a boy, used to make rise and fall, to
the astonishment of the other urchins,
<q>who, nothing able to guess
at its recondite machinery, were almost
tempted to hail its wondrous
work as magic.</q> Miss Landon thus
celebrates it:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>The fountain's low singing is heard on the wind,</q></l>
<l>Like a melody bringing sweet fancies to mind,</l>
<l>Some to grieve, some to gladden; around them they cast</l>
<l>The hopes of the morrow, the dreams of the past.</l>
<l>Away in the distance is heard the vast sound.</l>
<l>From the streets of the city that compass it round,</l>
<l>Like the echo of fountains, or ocean's deep call;</l>
<l><q rend='post'>Yet that fountain's low singing is heard over all.</q></l>
</lg>

</quote>

<p>
And yonder are the sun-dials, on
which Lamb so sweetly moralizes&mdash;the
inscriptions no longer half effaced,
but bright with the gilding
of 1872. <q><foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Pereunt et imputantur</foreign></q>;
<q><foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Discite justitiam moniti</foreign></q>; <q><foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Vestigia
<pb n='108'/><anchor id='Pg108'/>
nulla retrorsum</foreign></q>; and <q>Time
and tide tarry for no man,</q> are
some of the mottoes on them. It
is rather a disappointment to find
them looking so new and fresh, as
if no longer <q>coeval with the time
they measure.</q> There is something
wonderfully poetical about a sun-dial,
which derives its revelations
of time's flight <q>immediately from
heaven, holding correspondence
with the fountain of light.</q> It has
a kind of relationship to nature,
and is, therefore, the very thing to
have in gardens and groves and
green fields <q>for sweet plants and
flowers to spring up by, for the
birds to apportion their silver warblings
by, for flocks to pasture and
be led to fold by.</q> It has a <q>heart-language</q>
not heard from a clock,
with <q>its solemn dulness of communication.</q>
When we give up modern
artificial life, and return to our
primitive relationship with nature,
we shall only measure the flight of
time by a sun-dial, or an hour-glass,
or the opening and shutting of
flowers.
</p>

<p>
It is delightful wandering around
the Temple gardens, with their
shrubbery and flowers and fountains,
and especially along the terrace
overlooking the Thames. Here
one naturally looks around for the
old benchers of Lamb's time, half
expecting to be greeted by the pensive
gentility of Samuel Salt, or the
quadrate person of Thomas Coventry,
coming along with <q>step massy
and elephantine, his face square as
the lion's, his gait peremptory and
path-keeping,</q> the terror of children,
who flee before him as from
an <q>Elisha bear.</q> One can also
<q>fancy good Sir Roger de Coverley
and Mr. Spectator, with his
short face, pacing up and down the
road, or dear Oliver Goldsmith in the
summer-house, perhaps meditating
about the next <hi rend='italic'>Citizen of the World</hi>,
or the new suit that Mr. Filby, the
tailor, is fashioning for him, or the
dunning letter that Mr. Newbury
has sent. Treading heavily on the
gravel, and rolling majestically
along in a snuff-colored suit and a
wig that sadly wants the barber's
powder and irons, one sees the
great doctor, with Boswell behind
him, a little the worse for the port-wine
they have been taking at the
Mitre, to ask Goldsmith to come
home and take a dish of tea with
Mrs. Williams.</q>

<head>Was Origen A Heretic?</head>

<p>
Origin has been pronounced by
the verdict of ages a genius of the
first order. But on this man there
has also been pronounced another
verdict of still greater importance:
<q>No one has surpassed him either in
good or in evil</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Ubi bene nemo melius,
ubi male nemo pejus</hi>. Terrible
words on a man who was the wonder
of his age, and an uncompromising
father of the church! We propose
to set forth in this article
some of the reasons tending to
prove that this sentence is an unjust
one, and that Origen was a
faithful child of the church&mdash;faithful,
too, at a time when fidelity was
tried by the fire, the sword, or the
cold, damp dungeon. We bring
forward the reasons of our opinion,
suppressing none of the accusations
that have been brought against this
great man at sundry times, but refuting
them by arguments which are at
least extremely probable, and have
convinced some very eminent scholars.
</p>

<p>
The orthodoxy of Origen is presumptively
established from the
pure sources from which he received
the rudiments of the Christian
faith, from the soundness of
the doctrines he is known to have
taught during his public ministry,
from his saintly associations, from
his undoubted works, and from his
heroic virtues.
</p>

<p>
Born in the bosom of the church,
of noble and virtuous parents, in the
year 185, he drank in with the nutriment
of his infancy the pure and
saving doctrines of Christianity.
As his powers of reason expanded,
the beauty and splendor of the new
but persecuted religion were laid
open before him by S. Leonides,
his father, whose celebrity as a philosopher
was only equalled by his
proficiency in profane and sacred
sciences. Under such fostering
care and parental cultivation, Origen
received the most careful training,
the wisest instructions, and most
virtuous examples. So deeply did
this pious and excellently versed
man plant the germs of Catholic
<pb n='110'/><anchor id='Pg110'/>
truth in the heart of his eldest son
that the most flattering promises
of Roman governors, the most subtle
reasonings of philosophers, were
alike unable to entice him into the
paths of error at an age when the
passions are strongest and the glittering
tinsel of worldly honors exerts
so powerful an influence on
the mind. S. Leonides, aware of
the necessity and value of religious
education in youth, took every precaution
to instil virtue into the
heart while profane learning entered
into the mind. Each day
he required Origen to commit to
memory certain parts of the Old and
New Testaments, and, after their recital
and an invocation of the Holy
Ghost, he explained the sense of
the Scripture. A plant reared in
such soil, and impregnated with an
atmosphere so holy, must be beautiful
to the sight in its maturity.
Advanced in the liberal arts to a
degree far beyond his years, Origen
made those studies only accessories
to a more complete attainment
of sacred knowledge. His progress
in the sciences was only rivalled
by his increase in piety.
What a deep root religion had
taken in his nature may be known
from his burning ardor to win the
glorious crown of martyrdom when
the bloody persecution of Septimius
Severus raged with unequalled
fury in his native city, Alexandria.
Among its victims was his father.
Deprived of the boon of losing his
life for Christ in his company, he
wrote letters of encouragement and
exhortation that S. Leonides would
endure his torments heroically,
looking only to the future life and
its incorruptible inheritance. It
was painful for Leonides to leave
behind him seven orphan children;
but, to alleviate his sorrows in this
direction, Origen, upon whom he
looked as a living tabernacle of the
Holy Spirit, sent him words of
cheer: <q>Be sure, dear father, that
on our account you do not alter
your mind</q>; and in another part
of the same letter we read words
which appear almost incredible
coming from one so young: <q>Have
confidence, father; leave all for
Jesus Christ; he will be your reward.</q>
S. Leonides was beheaded,
his property confiscated, according
to the laws, and Origen, at seventeen
years of age, found himself
and the rest of his family reduced
from abundance to poverty for the
sake of Christ. Next to dying in
the faith, there is no greater blessing
than to have been born in it.
From a martyr and a bishop<note place='foot'>S. Leonides was also a bishop. See Euseb.,
<hi rend='italic'>Hist.</hi> 6, c. 12; also S. Jerome, <hi rend='italic'>Catal.</hi>, c. 54.</note> Origen
learned the rudiments of the
faith, and it grew with his growth
and strengthened with his strength.
Those who had charge of his education
at the most critical juncture
were still more eminent in letters
and sanctity than Leonides.
</p>

<p>
He was placed under Titus Flavius
Clemens, generally known as S. Clement
of Alexandria, whom S. Jerome<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Catal. et Ep. ad Magn.</hi></note>
considered <q>the most learned
of our authors,</q> and who, Theodoret
believed,<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Hæret. Fab.</hi>, l. 1, c. 8.</note> <q>surpassed all
others in the extent of his learning.</q>
The erudition of Flavius
Clement found in Origen a worthy
receptacle, and the Christian morality
taught in his lectures and
practised in his life were truly reflected
in the rising glory of the
East. Clement, drinking from the
crystal fountain of truth that issued
from the evangelist Mark, who had
made, by the order of the prince
of the apostles, Alexandria his
apostolic seat, imbibed its saving
<pb n='111'/><anchor id='Pg111'/>
waters in all their purity. In his
<hi rend='italic'>Stromata</hi>, as well as on the authority
of Eusebius, we learn that the
immediate successors of the apostles,
preservers of the true doctrine
of S. James, S. John, S. Paul, were
still in existence and teaching the
Gospel in its entirety. <q>They
have lived down to our times,</q>
says Clement,<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Stromata</hi>, 1, 1.</note> <q>and scattered in
our hearts the seed of truth which
they had received of their predecessors,
the apostles.</q> It was from
this beautiful and fertile garden
that Origen culled the flowers of
Christianity that ornamented his
soul, that bloom in his luminous
works, that preserve their fragrance
and throw around sacred studies an
imperishable lustre. While Origen
was pursuing his studies under Clement,
he did not fail to engraft
upon himself the holiness and sanctity
of his teacher&mdash;the <hi rend='italic'>Pedagogue</hi>
of the master was transformed into
the life of the scholar. The holy
practices running through the <hi rend='italic'>Pedagogue</hi>,
its inculcation of austere
morals and inexhaustible charity,
became to Origen, through his long
and arduous career, hand-posts
pointing to solid grandeur, durable
happiness, and supreme good.
</p>

<p>
On leaving this famous catechetical
school, he perfected himself under
Ammonius Saccas, whose celebrity
among pagans for the reconciliation
he effected between jarring
philosophical systems was
only eclipsed by the esteem in
which he was held by the infant
church, to whose cause he brought
the aid of philosophy and the requirements
of the times. Among
all those who attended the lectures
of Ammonius, the most remarkable
was young Origen, though he had
for rivals no less famous persons
than Plotinus, the philosopher and
teacher of Porphyry, and the critic
Longinus. All eyes were centred
on Origen, and his name was in
every mouth&mdash;his mind a prodigy
of letters, his soul a temple of the
Holy Ghost. The vast amount of
erudition now acquired by Origen,
not only by reason of his extraordinary
abilities, but also on account
of his eminent preceptors, whose
sanctity of life imparted to their
expositions of religion the irresistible
authority of example, attached
him with unshaken firmness to
the infallible truths which were sealed
by his father's blood. No other
belief could satisfy his yearnings,
no other creed answer to the wide
comprehensions of his conceptions
and the loftiness of his aspirations.
</p>

<p>
The completion of his studies
found him versed in astronomy,
the higher mathematics, thoroughly
acquainted with the sentiments
and theories of the different philosophical
schools, and more or less
familiar with the construction of
languages and the leading issues of
the times. Reduced to straitened
circumstances in consequence
of the persecution, he opened, on
his own responsibility, an institution
for dialectics, music, and profane
sciences.
</p>

<p>
This was a dangerous enterprise
for one so young, but it was the
only alternative to avoid a life of
dependency and association with
heretics, as well as to assist a
helpless mother and a large family.
He felt bound to shun the enemies
of the church; he refused to mingle
in their company, save when the
necessity of their spiritual welfare
demanded it, or the exigencies of
the occasion prevented his escape.
Scrupulous even to the spirit of
the apostolic teachings, rather than
associate with the opponents of
<pb n='112'/><anchor id='Pg112'/>
Christianity, he preferred to sacrifice
the friendships of his youth and
the liberality of his patroness, at a
time, too, when he stood most in
need of assistance. His reputation
attracted large numbers to his
lectures, and the applause he received,
while it elevated him in
popularity, was the source of interior
humiliation, the antidote of
pride. Demetrius, Bishop of Alexandria,
moved by the superior attainments,
the fervent piety and
unswerving orthodoxy in faith, of
the young Christian, appointed him
regent of the famous catechetical
school, <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> 203. The course of
studies taught in this institution
comprised, aside from secular pursuits,
theology and Scriptural expositions.
Origen<note place='foot'>S. Jerome, <hi rend='italic'>Catal.</hi>, c. 54.</note> was only eighteen
years of age when he assumed
this responsible charge&mdash;a charge
that, in the history of the province,
had never been committed
but to persons of advanced years.
This appointment, then, was an
exception, strange in the extreme;
but Origen was an exceptional
scholar&mdash;so exceptional, indeed,
that history has failed to record his
compeer at that time of life in any
other person. But, as St. Jerome<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Ibidem.</hi></note>
remarks, <q>From his childhood he
was a great man.</q> And Bossuet,
admiring the young Alexandrian,
towering in intellect above those
of his day, like Saul above his
brethren, declares: <q>Il se rendit
célèbre par toute l'Eglise des sa
première jeunesse et enseigna de
grandes vérités.</q><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Hist. Univ. Douzième Epoque.</hi></note> The violence of
the persecution under Septimius
Severus had interrupted the Christian
school of Alexandria, and
forced its president, Clement, to fly
from his murderers. It was during
his retirement and under the uplifted sword that Origen assumed the
regency&mdash;a position as precarious
and laborious as it was honorable.
It required varied knowledge, uncommon
prudence, and unswerving
adhesion to the traditions of Christ's
ambassadors.
</p>

<p>
For more than one hundred
years Catholic blood, <q>the secret
power and seed of Christianity,</q><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Tertullian.</hi></note>
had flowed through the Roman
provinces; Catholic heads been
decapitated by the sword of the
executioner. Every method of
destruction and annihilation that
human artifice and cruelty could
devise was brought into play to
sweep from the world the new
religion; but the kingdom of Christ
emerged from the contest more
glorious and powerful, and asserted
in bolder terms the divinity which
was emblazoned on its standard.
The saying of Gamaliel was verified:
Man cannot stop the accomplishment
of God's designs. Then
the pagans felt convinced that
some other means should be employed
against the Christians, whom
the emperors and governors had in
vain sought to extinguish in blood.
To this end, they had recourse to
the schools, to the philosophers, to
men skilled in the oracles; the followers
of the different systems of
belief, to preserve the existence of
their body, girded on their helmets
of sophistry and raillery; the pagan
writers dealt in flings of irony and
the gall of mockery; wit and sarcasm,
powerful weapons, were handled
with remarkable ingenuity.
The life-blood of mythology, sanctioned
for ages by the devotion of
its victims, was on the eve of ebbing
from its very arteries; polytheism,
rooted in the manners of
the multitude, supported by legislation,
<pb n='113'/><anchor id='Pg113'/>
upheld in literature, protected
by the sympathies of all,
was losing ground at every step
that Christianity was making upon
its domains; idolatry saw its statues
fall one by one, its members disappearing
like vapor beneath the
absorbing rays of light; and all
these forms of superstition joined
hands and allied their forces to impede
the onward and irresistible
march of Catholic truth. Alexandria,
cradle of Eastern genius at
that time, became the Christian
Thermopylæ, and Origen the Christian
Leonidas. It was he who
headed the forces, and, by the
splendor of his genius, prepared in
his school illustrious men to lead
on the van. He vindicated the
truth from calumny, supported it
by facts, disengaged it from the
sophisms in which enemies had obscured
it, and held it up to view in
all its natural beauty and attraction.
His learning became telling
in a short time upon the prejudices
of the people in regard to his despised
religion, and gradually inspired
a kinder feeling towards the
misrepresented Christians in the
minds of the cultivated. His fame
drew to his auditory persons who
had studied under other masters,
desirous of listening to his wisdom,
and of the honor of calling him their
teacher. Heathens were delighted
with his language, full of unction
and charm, and the literati of the age,
who had been lost in the intricacies
of Aristotle, the obscurities of Plato,
and the absurdities of Epicurus,
wondered at the young Christian
philosopher. His name was asked
by authors for dedicatory purposes,
and works were subject to his judgment
for their circulation.
</p>

<p>
To give an insight into the system
of education adopted by Origen,
and which produced so many great
men in the IIId century, we will
quote from the writings of S. Gregory
Thaumaturgus, who was under
the direction of Origen for five
years, the method employed by the
philosopher to win him to Christ.
The extract will also show the
clearness of his ideas, the thoroughness
and universality of his knowledge.
The reader, if he chooses,
may compare the plan of education
followed by Origen with that pursued
in our colleges and universities
in the XIXth century, and
judge for himself of the progress
civilization has made in this direction.
<q>Like a skilful agriculturist,</q>
says S. Gregory,<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>General History of the Catholic Church</hi>, Darras.
American translation, vol. i. p. 218.</note> <q>who examines in
all its aspects the land which he
intends to prepare for cultivation,
Origen sounded and penetrated the
sentiments of his disciples, making
inquiries, and reflecting upon
their replies. When he had prepared
them to receive the seed of
truth, he instructed them in various
branches of philosophy&mdash;in logic,
to form their judgment, by teaching
them to discriminate between
solid reasonings and the specious
sophisms of error; in physics, to
make them admire the wisdom of
God, by an analytic knowledge of his
works; in geometry, to habituate
their minds to rectitude, by the rigor
of mathematical propositions; in
astronomy, to elevate and extend
their thoughts, by giving them immensity
for a horizon; finally, in
morals&mdash;not those of the philosophers,
whose definitions and sterile
divisions give birth to no virtue,
but practical morals, making them
study in themselves the movements
of the passions, so that the soul,
seeing itself as in a mirror, may extirpate
every vice, even to the roots.
He then approached theology, or
<pb n='114'/><anchor id='Pg114'/>
the knowledge of God. He made
them read on Providence, which
has created the world and governs
it, all that has been written by
the ancients, philosophers or poets,
Greeks or barbarians, without otherwise
minding their systems, their
sects, or their particular opinions.
In this labyrinth of pagan philosophy
he served as their guide to discern
whatever might be really true
and useful, without allowing them
to be fascinated by the pomp and
ornaments of language. He laid it
down as a principle, that, in whatever
regards God, we must trust
only God and the prophets inspired
by him. And then he commenced
the interpretation of the
Scriptures, which he knew thoroughly,
and which, by the grace of God,
he had penetrated in all their most
secret depths.</q>
</p>

<p>
The magnitude of his intellectual
powers excited no less interest than
his manner of life; and it is not
without reason that his friends allege
the sanctity of his life as the
best interpreter of the few objectionable
passages in his gigantic
works, and no weak argument for
the purity of his faith. Surrounded
by eminent <emph>savants</emph>, and in correspondence
with others in distant
countries, he found himself hard
pressed to accommodate the former
and answer the communications of
the latter. He was obliged to engage
several secretaries to write out
his discourses on the arts and sciences
in conjunction with his explanations
of Christianity. Their
assistance afforded him better opportunities
of enriching his stock
of knowledge. He realized what
Trithemius,<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Monks of the West</hi>, vol. ii. p. 33.</note> Abbot of Spanheim,
repeated to himself every day: <q>To
know is to love.</q> His insatiable
thirst for learning left him plodding
among manuscripts through
the day into the long hours of the
night; and when nature, succumbing
under the severe stress of exhaustion,
would demand rest, he would
make the bare ground his bed, and
the books his pillow. Simple in his
dress, the mortifications he imposed
upon himself on several occasions
threatened his life. Temperate in
all things, he was particularly so in
drink. Wine he never used.
</p>

<p>
While his prodigious talents and
able discourses brought within the
true fold large numbers from
among the most distinguished learned
men and philosophers, his virtues
and sublime renunciation of the
world produced so many holy men
that his school has been deservedly
termed <q><hi rend='italic'>the school of martyrs</hi>.</q>
More than once he accompanied
his disciples to the place of execution,
and exhorted them, in the very
face of the instruments of torture,
to endure death with fortitude for the
cause of truth and the eternal inheritance
promised to those who wash
their robes in the blood of the
Lamb. He stood by at the martyrdom
of S. Plutarch, brother of
S. Heraclas, Bishop of Alexandria,
both catechumens under himself, administering
consolations and pouring
into his soul words of hope and
encouragement. A martyr's crown
he courted from infancy, and from
sickness and infirmities contracted
in the persecutor's dungeon, it is
reasonably supposed, his life went
out. It could only have been divine
interposition that rescued him
from the numerous assaults made
upon his life. When permission
was refused him to visit the Christians
in chains, he made incredible
efforts to convey to them words of
sympathy and articles of comfort.
His solicitude and bearing on the
<pb n='115'/><anchor id='Pg115'/>
eve of the martyrdom of his disciples,
SS. Heron, Potamiæna, Herias,
Sereni, and Heraclides, is
conclusive proof of Origen's ardor
to seal with his blood the divinity
of the cause he advocated
with his eloquence, and evidence
of the falsity of the notorious slander
which represents him yielding
to the wishes of the persecutors in
the midst of his torments, and offering
sacrifice to the gods. The first
trace we meet with in history of
this accusation is in the <hi rend='italic'>Treatise
against Heresies</hi>,<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Hæres.</hi>, 64.</note> by S. Epiphanius,
Bishop of Salamis, and given to the
world one hundred years after the
death of Origen. This slander,
never repeated by the learned&mdash;if we
except Petavius, in the XVIIth century,
while employed on the works
of Epiphanius&mdash;has been wiped out
of ecclesiastical history by the
weight of such writers as Baronius,
Halloix,<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Orig. Defens.</hi>, l. 4, note p. 35.</note> Raynaudet, Henry Valois,
Vincent de la Rue, and Frederic
Spanheim.<note place='foot'>Preface, Bellamy's Translation of Origen's
<hi rend='italic'>Apology</hi>.</note> This defamation of
his character, unfounded as it is,
though so much like other insinuations
against the noble Alexandrian,
was not even alluded to in
the Justinian age, in which he
was so violently and bitterly opposed.
Had S. Jerome credited
this monstrous fabrication, had it
rested upon anything but a sandy
foundation, the literary war between
the lifelong friends, Jerome
and Rufinus, would have terminated
at the first volley from the
pen of the learned scriptural writer.
It would have been a crushing
argument against Rufinus, and
S. Jerome was the person to turn it
to advantage. In those times, it
was a common thing to be reproached
if one, arrested for the
faith, escaped death. Some of the
greatest saints, S. Cyprian, S. Gregory
Thaumaturgus, and others,
suffered not a little from calumnies
of like import. Origen's behavior,
on the occasion to which the allusion
refers, was honorable, heroic,
and in entire harmony with his life-long
fidelity to principle. He was
seized, and&mdash;whether it was the design
of the magistrates to draw
many Christians back to the gods
of the empire by circulating the fall
of Origen, or their admiration of the
genius of their noble victim that
prevented his summary decapitation&mdash;was
thrown into a cold cell,
bound in an iron collar, with heavy
shackles to his feet, and his legs
drawn apart to a painful degree.
</p>

<p>
It appears that during the first
years that Origen filled the regency
of the Alexandrian theological seminary,
he experienced no small
amount of inconvenience, in his controversial
discourses with Jews and
pagans, in consequence of the different
versions of the Holy Scriptures.
In their inspired pages he found
true wisdom and spiritual life: <q>Oh!
how have I loved thy law, O Lord!
It is my meditation all the day.</q><note place='foot'>Ps. cxviii.</note>
In this sacred department he stands
without a rival, if we except S. Jerome,
<q>the greatest doctor, divinely
raised up to interpret the Sacred
Scriptures.</q><note place='foot'>Preface to Vulgate.</note> Yet to Origen the
indebtedness of S. Jerome is very
great. He borrowed<note place='foot'>Pref. <hi rend='italic'>ad Ephes.</hi></note> from him,
studied him,<note place='foot'>Pref. <hi rend='italic'>in Pentateuch</hi>.</note> followed him,<note place='foot'>Pref. <hi rend='italic'>in Job</hi>.</note> admired
him,<note place='foot'>Introd. <hi rend='italic'>in Cantica</hi>, etc., translated by Jerome
from Origen.</note> and then attacked
him.<note place='foot'>Lib. 2 <hi rend='italic'>adv. Rufinus et passim</hi>.</note> S. Jerome declares that in
reading the <hi rend='italic'>Twelve Prophets</hi> by
Origen, in the works of S. Pamphilus,
he saw in them the wealth of
<pb n='116'/><anchor id='Pg116'/>
Crœsus; and, as far as our judgment
goes, we never read a higher
eulogium than the one S. Jerome
pays to the genius of Origen on his
two homilies <hi rend='italic'>in Cantica Canticorum</hi>.
</p>

<p>
It was Origen's love of the Scriptures
that gave birth to the grand
idea of compiling the sacred books
of the different versions into one
work&mdash;the <hi rend='italic'>Octapla</hi>, a legacy to
posterity more than sufficient to
support his reputation and endear
it to all succeeding ages. For this
purpose, he decided, in 212, to travel
through different countries, and
collect the most recognized and
authentic copies of the Scriptures.
Those travels opened to his view
the pages of nature, on which he
read the customs and habits of men,
religions and governments, arts and
sciences. Aside from those motives,
he had another reason for travelling.
He longed to see Rome, the chair
of Peter,<note place='foot'>In c. 6 <hi rend='italic'>Ep. ad Rom.</hi></note> <q>upon whom, as on a rock,
Christ built his church</q>; he desired
to pay his homage in the <q>principal
church</q><note place='foot'>Tract. <hi rend='italic'>in Matt.</hi></note> to the successor of S.
Peter, <q>against whom the gates of
hell shall not prevail.</q><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Apud Euseb.</hi>, l. 6, hist. c. 19.</note> He arrived
at Rome about the close of
the pontificate of S. Zephyrinus, to
whom his presence and devotion
must have been a source of consolation,
as the saintly pontiff, at that
time, was pained to the heart by
the fall of the great Tertullian
and the deplorable perversions in
the African Church.
</p>

<p>
The travels of Origen are full
of interest and instruction. Each
journey was a crusade against
heathenism, and a glorious triumph
for the Gospel; like S. Paul, he
wandered over sea and land to
make profit for Christ, strengthening
the weak and marshalling the
strong; the power of his pen was
felt where his voice failed to reach.
As a comet that illumines its course
with darting rays of light, and obscures
the flickering stars, such
were the brilliant tours of Origen,
leaving the light of faith and the
fire of charity behind them. Wherever
heresy raised its head in the
church, there was Origen to batter
it with reason and tradition; wherever
the faithful were wavering,
there was Origen cheering and rallying
the forces; wherever the enemy
made an onslaught on Christianity,
it found Origen in the breach;
like an Agamemnon or a Hector,
wherever battle raged the fiercest,
Origen took the front. Now he is
in the presence of the governor of
Arabia, enlightens him on scientific
subjects, and gradually raises his
mind to nature's God; then he
traverses through Palestine, expounding
the Scriptures in the assemblies
of the faithful; at one
time he is at Antioch before the
royal family, pleading for the liberty
and free exercise of Christian worship;
at another in Nicomedia, maintaining
the canonicity of certain
parts of the inspired writings; now
he is in Greece, thundering against
the Montanists; and again in Arabia,
at Bozra, reclaiming fallen prelates,
and defending the divinity
and humanity of the second Person
of the Most Blessed Trinity.
</p>

<p>
There is a point in the preceding
sentence worthy of more than
passing notice&mdash;namely, Origen's
visit to Mammæa, mother of Emperor
Alexander Severus. This estimable
lady, who afterwards, in all
probability, embraced the Christian
religion, desirous of seeing so illustrious
a doctor as Origen, sent her
retinue to escort him to her palace.
She was pleased with her learned
guest, and her son, the future ruler
of the empire, listened with delight
<pb n='117'/><anchor id='Pg117'/>
to the great prodigy of learning.
The virtues that characterized the
reign of Severus, in contradistinction
to the licentiousness, cruelty,
and extortion of his predecessors,
have been, not without justice, attributed
to the influence exerted
on him by lessons of morality given
in the discourses of Origen. It is
not improbable that the law he presented,
soon after his ascension to
the throne, to the Roman senate
for its sanction, whereby the religion
of Christ would be incorporated
among the others of the empire,
had for its source Origen's instructions
to him about the divinity of the
Catholic faith, its purity and sanctity.
Dom Gueranger, in his <hi rend='italic'>Life of
S. Cecilia</hi>,<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Life of S. Cecilia</hi>, pp. 9 and 10.</note> adduces monuments of
antiquity going to prove the protection
and favors extended to the
infant church by Alexander; and
Origen himself,<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Cel.</hi>, l. 3.</note> in his <hi rend='italic'>Apology</hi>,
chronicles the abatement of the persecution
shortly after his return
from the imperial court. On this
part of his work a writer very felicitously
adds: <q>If he modestly declines
telling us the part he bore
in it, we owe him so much the
more honor the less he seems to
claim.</q><note place='foot'>Butler's <hi rend='italic'>Saints</hi>, vol. ii. p. 141.</note>
</p>

<p>
During the comparative peace
obtained under Alexander, the
church made incredible efforts to
fill up her shattered ranks, restore
order, and produce scholars. She
succeeded, for never was she more
fruitful in great men than at this
epoch. Origen had reconciled her,
in the opinion of philosophers, to
genius, adorned her with intellectual
wealth, and introduced her to
the occupants of the throne she was
soon to fill with so much glory;
and, what is still more, he had disciplined
a galaxy of scholars, who
were about to dazzle the world by
the grandeur of their minds, and
beautify the church by the holiness
of their lives.
</p>

<p>
Origen's brilliant career, like the
career of all great men, was not
allowed to end without its trials.
Aside from the assaults of the professed
enemies of the church, he
met with severe annoyances from
the jealousy of those whose interests
he had studied to further. The
trouble came from a quarter he
least expected. Demetrius, Bishop
of Alexandria, during the early part
of his episcopate entertained for
Origen the highest esteem; and
there is no ostensible motive to
believe that Origen, throughout all
his relations with the patriarch, gave
him any cause of offence, or else
this prelate would not have retained
him in the presidency of his theological
school till the year 230&mdash;a
period of twenty-seven years. The
humility of the regent and his
innate respect for authority held
his tongue in silence, whatever may
have been his opinion of the conduct
of Demetrius as a prelate.
Still, we may conjecture Demetrius
was not far from the mind of Origen
when, in speaking of disorders
and irregularities in the church, he
wrote of bishops: <q>We would
almost have guards like kings; we
make ourselves terrible and difficult
of access, chiefly to the poor; we
treat them who speak with us and
ask for some favor in a manner
which the most cruel tyrants and
governors would not assume towards
suppliants.</q><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Leviticus</hi>, hom. 9.</note> It is not wrong
to look upon Demetrius as a man
who consulted with the general interests
of Christianity his own popularity,
the extension of his diocese,
<pb n='118'/><anchor id='Pg118'/>
and the increase of his subjects;
perhaps he was of the opinion that
the advancement of religion in
Alexandria and its suffragan dependencies,
his own juridical district,
was of more importance than its
dissemination in other places. It
was interested motives of this sort
that led him to disapprove of Origen's
evangelical missions, by which
his invaluable services were temporarily
withdrawn from his native
city. Origen, being a layman, free
from any obligations to Demetrius,
except in a spiritual point of view,
possessed the individual right of
travelling from country to country,
and of delivering lectures without
the permission of any authority.
If he spoke before the congregations
of the faithful, it was only
at the urgent solicitation of the
prelates, whose jurisdiction within
their respective provinces was recognized
and unquestioned; champion
of the faith in the East, he was
waited upon by delegations from
pious bishops, entreating him to
come to their dioceses. Those
missions Origen, in his love for the
glory of God, felt conscientiously
bound to perform. On a journey
to crush by his eloquence the heresy
of the Valentinians, that had
made lamentable ravages in Greece,
he paid a visit to S. Alexander
of Jerusalem and Theoctistus of
Cæsarea, by whom he was ordained
priest. This act, irreprehensible
in itself, entailed upon Origen
serious difficulties, and became the
groundwork upon which his enemies
fabricated the most severe accusations.
</p>

<p>
Demetrius, taking to heart the
course of conduct of the great
philosopher, and assured, by the
aspect of things, of his speedy
disconnection with the interests
of Alexandria, sent letters to the
bishops, containing bitter recriminations
for imposing hands on Origen.
He did not stop at this point. He
also despatched to the prelates of
Asia letters full of invectives and
animosity, requiring them to hold
no communion with Origen, who
had violated the disciplinary canons.
The respite that ensued on
his return to Alexandria was of
short duration. A council was
<q>assembled by the care, and under
the presidency, of Demetrius,</q> for
the purpose of examining the
legality and validity of Origen's
ordination. In this council we can
only discover two things laid to his
charge&mdash;namely, that he had made
himself a eunuch, and had been
ordained without the consent of
Demetrius, his ordinary. Those
charges, if we take into consideration
the customs of the times and
the imperfections of ecclesiastical
discipline during the persecutions,
contain in themselves very little
upon which a grievous censure of
Origen could be founded. In the
language of the church, they are
irregularities; one <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ex defectu</foreign>, the
other <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ex delicto</foreign>. Let us for a
moment concede that there were
such canons in existence at the
time of Origen's ordination, by the
violation of which irregularities
were incurred, what then follows?
In that age of the church, bishops
enjoyed great privileges, discretionary
powers&mdash;far more discretionary
than even the bishops of the
United States enjoy nowadays in
this missionary country&mdash;and pre-eminently
so the Patriarch of Alexandria,
the Patriarch of Antioch,
and the Metropolitan of Palestine,
who was Bishop of Cæsarea. These
prelates could dispense, in nearly
all emergencies, the violators of the
ecclesiastical ordinances; other
prelates in the East were more or
<pb n='119'/><anchor id='Pg119'/>
less restricted in their functions,
and in matters of moment could do
nothing detrimental to those sees.
What authority, then, prevented
Theoctistus from pronouncing Origen
released from the irregularities,
and canonically qualified for the
reception of orders? Had any
other ordinary imposed hands on
him except the Metropolitan of
Palestine, the objections of the
Patriarch of Alexandria would
undoubtedly have carried with
them more weight. But the Metropolitan
of Cæsarea, while respectfully
acquiescing in the priority
of the See of Alexandria, through
reverence of its princely founder,
always exercised his own jurisdiction
without the permission or consultation
of Alexandria. Theoctistus
of Cæsarea was not even under
Demetrius, but under the Patriarch
of Antioch, and these provincial
and patriarchal boundaries as well
as episcopal relations were only
finally authoritatively adjusted by
the Council of Nice.<note place='foot'>See <hi rend='italic'>Acts of the Council of Nice</hi> for proof of
this line of reasoning&mdash;<q>Apostolic Canons.</q></note> In the second
place, the Metropolitan of Cæsarea,
who always exercised more than
ordinary episcopal functions, which
were afterwards approved and
sanctioned by œcumenical councils,<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Can. de Hierarchia Ecclesiæ Con. Nicenem.</hi></note>
deemed it not a usurpation of
power to impose hands on Origen
without the <emph>direct</emph> consent of his
bishop, inasmuch as he was personally
acquainted with the subject of
the sacrament, morally certain of
his piety and learning. If we add
to those reasons the surrounding
circumstances stated in the reply
of S. Alexander of Jerusalem to
Demetrius, it becomes patent that
neither Origen was to blame in the
premises nor Theoctistus for the
exercise of his jurisdiction and
powers. Demetrius had given Origen
commendatory letters on his
departure for Greece, and, on the
strength of these commendations,
Theoctistus and S. Alexander conferred
on him holy orders. His
services had been valuable as a layman;
they would become still more
valuable as a cleric, and, actuated
by those pure motives, they ordained
him.
</p>

<p>
Now, is it historically true that
in the year 230, or previous to that
time, there were any such canons
framed by the church as excluded
eunuchs from the reception of
holy orders? It will be difficult
to come across statutes of this nature
in canon law or ecclesiastical
history. We will find such acts of
discipline framed years after the
death of Origen, but none previous
to that epoch.
</p>

<p>
The other accusation, that he was
ordained without the permission
of his bishop, has a weaker foundation
even than the preceding one.
According to the practice of the
church in our day, every candidate
for the sacred ministry who is not
a religious must be ordained by
his own bishop (<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>titulo nativitatis,
domicilii, beneficii, seu familiaritatis
prout accidit</foreign>), or possess the written
consent of his own ordinary, if ordained
by another. Origen, viewed
from a modern stand-point, contracted
an irregularity <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ex delicto</foreign>; but,
judged in the century in which he
lived&mdash;the only one in which he
must be judged&mdash;was as regular in
his ordination as the young men
who are semi-annually ordained in
our provincial seminaries. Origen
transgressed no ecclesiastical injunction
by receiving orders at the
hands of a foreign bishop, because
it was only under S. Anastasius
that this restriction was placed on
aspirants to the priesthood. The
<pb n='120'/><anchor id='Pg120'/>
Council of Nice, embodying the
canons of Arles, Ancyra, and Gangres,
passed laws prohibiting clerics
from attaching themselves at will
to different churches and dioceses;
this prohibition affected clerics
alone, and in no way referred to laics,
who were at perfect liberty to be
ordained by any prelate upon testimonials
of worthiness. It was only
during S. Ambrose's time that this
abuse became offensive, and that
the Roman pontiff deemed it proper
to eradicate it. To this end, in
the year 400 a canon was enacted
by the pope, which forbade any
prelate ordaining the subjects of
another, unless such subjects had
permissive letters bearing the signature
of the bishop who had
authority over them. From this
sprang dimissorial letters. Indeed,
whatever view an impartial and
competent person takes of the
whole affair, Origen and the saintly
bishops who ordained him appear
innocent, and seem to have acted
with the best intentions. Nevertheless,
the decision arrived at by
Demetrius' council was that Origen
should be dismissed from the
theological school, upon which his
learning had reflected so much
glory, and that he should also withdraw
himself from Alexandria, retaining,
however, his priesthood.
</p>

<p>
Origen, anticipating the result of
the council <q>assembled by the care
of Demetrius,</q> quietly retired to
Cæsarea. Matters did not end
here. The immense amount of
writings that the unwearied industry
of Origen had contributed to
the literature of the church offered
a wide field in which his adversaries
might search for something reprehensible.
His works would form
in themselves a rare library, had
the fall of empires not entombed a
large portion of them in their ruins.
No less than six thousand books
did his indefatigable application
produce: <q>Sex millia Origenis tomos
non poterant quipiam legere.</q><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Apud Hieron., adv. Theophilus.</hi></note>
In the copying, revision,
and compiling of these manuscripts,
he employed twenty, at other times
twelve, but always more than eight,
amanuenses. As this article has
no reference to his writings, their
merits, or the influence they exerted
upon church learning, we
must make this cursory allusion to
his gigantic labors sufficient for our
present purpose. It will lay before
the reader the great mass of matter
his enemies had at hand to examine,
the possible mistakes that might
have crept into his works by the
carelessness of so many secretaries,
the possible corruptions they might
have suffered at the hands of heretics
or jealous rivals. Not a finger
could be raised against his spotless
and ascetic life in the council; the
teacher of martyrs and companion
of saints, his character was irreproachable.
</p>

<p>
Demetrius, not unlikely hearing
of the warm reception extended to
Origen in Palestine, convened, after
a short interval, another council.
The works of Origen were subjected
to the sharpest examination.
One instinctively inquires why Demetrius,
if he were simply actuated
by zeal for the preservation of ecclesiastical
discipline and the purity
of revealed truth, did not introduce
those serious charges in the
former council. To resort to the
non-publication of the <hi rend='italic'>Periarchon</hi>
and <hi rend='italic'>Dialogues</hi> at the time of the
first convocation of bishops, in order
to remove the suspicions that point
to the malice of Demetrius, is an
ingenious special plea, unsupported
by facts and testimonies. S. Jerome,
<pb n='121'/><anchor id='Pg121'/>
studying this question learnedly, defends
Origen and censures Demetrius.
Why did the Patriarch of Alexandria,
next in hierarchical honor
to the Bishop of Rome, permit Origen
for over a quarter of a century to
expound within his own hearing the
sublime dogmas of Christianity, if
his conceptions of those dogmas
were radically false? Can we suppose
that the few months between
the assembly of the two councils
were spent by the bibliophilist in
composing a work that would give
the lie to the glorious achievements
of thirty years? Or can we allow
the conviction to settle in our
minds that he, so remarkable in
virtue, would deliver in the pulpit
one doctrine, and write in his books
another? Will we find fault with
saints and illustrious doctors of the
church, who, by the nature of their
high calling, are bound to avoid false
teachers, for extending to Origen the
warmest hospitalities, or acknowledge,
with Eusebius of Cæsarea
and S. Pamphilus, the severe and
unjustifiable measures adopted by
Demetrius? Whatever secret motives
guided Demetrius in the prosecution
of the inquisition, his
course, disapproved of by his contemporaries,
has never secured a
sincere advocate of ordinary importance.
The errors which he imagined
he had detected in the writings
assumed, in the eyes of Demetrius'
council, sufficient gravity to cause
the deposition and excommunication
of Origen.
</p>

<p>
Never did an imperial edict, suddenly
proclaimed in the midst of
peace, sanctioning the indiscriminate
massacre of Christians, produce
greater consternation in the church
than the announcement of Origen's
deposition. The report of the fall
of the great Tertullian had scarce
died away, when the faithful were
filled with alarm at the momentary
expectation of its echoes being taken
up by the fall of Origen, and resounding
throughout Christendom.
But there was a vast difference between
these two great men. Quintius
Tertullianus, while the superior
of Origen in eloquence, style, and
strength of language, was at the
same time his inferior in the sacred
sciences and in humility, the safeguard
of Origen's genius. The one
blended with Christianity the elegance
and wisdom of the pagans,
the other the beauty and inspiration
of the prophets. Both the
brightest ornaments of the church
in their day, they no less adorned
her sanctity by their lives than enriched
her treasures by their genius.
Tertullian, a pagan by the prejudices
of birth and education, unaccustomed
to religious authority,
could not endure the correction of
superiors; and wounded pride, inflamed
by impatience and an ambitious
nature, gave way to impious
belief, and Tertullian, the fallen
genius, dwindles into a fanatical
heretic. It was not so with Origen.
Having received information of the
action of the council, with real humility
equalled only by that of the
meek Fénelon, Origen wrote<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Apud Hieron.</hi>, 2 lib. <q>adv. Rufinus,</q> et
opera S. Gregory Nyssen.</note> to
Alexandria that he had never taught
such doctrine as was imputed to
him, and, if contained in his works,
it was through the machinations of
heretics. Then follows, in the same
document, a clear and orthodox exposition
of his belief upon the contested
points&mdash;an exposition that
will satisfy a modern theologian,
with all his precise distinctions and
scholastic definitions. As long as
this monument of antiquity, this
spontaneous proof of his adhesion
to apostolic truth, this undeniable
<pb n='122'/><anchor id='Pg122'/>
evidence of the absence of all pertinacity,
exists, so long will those
to whom his memory is dear love
to look upon him as sincere in his
protestations and sincere in his
faith. Here was the rule of his belief,
and according to this rule his
works should be interpreted: <q>That
alone must we believe to be the truth
which differs in nothing from the
ecclesiastical and apostolical tradition.</q><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>De Principiis</hi>, lib. i. 4.</note>
A noble rule of faith, truly
Catholic and orthodox! Words appropriate
for an Origen, who caught
up, as it were, the traditions of the
apostles, and echoed them into
Nicene times. What cause have
we of refusing credence to Origen
when he tells us that the errors attributed
to him were the interpolations
of heretics? Every intelligent
reader of history knows that his
works were corrupted, shamefully
corrupted, at the close of the IVth
century. In substantiation of this,
we have only to refer to the learned
Rufinus and S. Jerome. Each
of these translated into Latin the
<hi rend='italic'>Periarchon</hi> of Origen and many
other works of the same author;
and what do we find? Why, S. Jerome
accuses Rufinus of altering,
inverting, suppressing the sense of
the original; and, in turn, Rufinus
charges Jerome with malicious perversion
of the meaning of the learned
Alexandrian, wilful corruption
of the text, and personal jealousy
of the fame of Origen. S. Augustine,
an intimate friend of S. Jerome,
used his influence to reconcile those
two great personages disputing
about Origen; and from his letter
to S. Jerome, it appears to us that
his sympathies were with Rufinus.
Indeed, in the first ages of the
church, it was no uncommon thing
for great men to have not only their
works interpolated, but entire books
circulated under their name, S.
Cyprian<note place='foot'>See Life in Butler, note vol. iii.</note> complained that works
that he had never seen were issued
in his name. S. Jerome<note place='foot'>Lib. 2. <hi rend='italic'>adv. Rufinus</hi>.</note> testifies
that the letters of S. Clement, Pope,
were interpolated, as well as the writings
of S. Dionysius and Clement
of Alexandria; the same trustworthy
author was very much annoyed
that the people of Africa in his
day were reading a supposititious
volume bearing his name. We see
no reason, then, why heretics would
not tamper with Origen's productions,
when they had the audacity
to corrupt such public and sacred
documents as those we have mentioned,
some of which were read in
the religious assemblies of the people.
It is the misfortune of exalted
persons to be cited as authorities
for opinions they never maintained.
Indeed, when we perceive how the
teachings of men amongst us are
misrepresented, notwithstanding the
assistance of the press, the telegraph,
and other modern detectives,
we can understand with what
facility opinions could have been
accredited to Origen which were
not his. Well might S. Jerome with
the works of Origen scattered
around his room, perhaps under
his very elbows, write: <q>O labores
hominum! semper incerti; O mortalium
studia! contrarios interdum
fines habentia.</q><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Apud Hier.</hi>, lib. 2. <hi rend='italic'>adv. Ruf.</hi> p. 217.</note>
</p>

<p>
The acts of Demetrius' council,
we are informed, were forwarded to
S. Pontianus, whose short pontificate
of a few years spent in exile, as well
as the still shorter reign of his successor,
S. Anterus, which lasted
only a month, was absorbed in the
discharge of duties more vital to
the church than the Alexandrian
<pb n='123'/><anchor id='Pg123'/>
inquisition. Ere Rome took any
steps in this matter, or sanctioned
the proceedings by her silence, the
discussion ended by the death of
Demetrius, 231.
</p>

<p>
It is probable that Origen indulged
in conceptions or hypotheses
not altogether in accordance
with Catholic doctrine; but we
must keep before our minds the
circumstances in which he was situated,
the persons with whom he
disputed, and the noble aim he had
in view. The philosophy of Aristotle,
whom Tertullian calls the
<q>patriarch of heretics,</q> was very
unpopular in Alexandria at the
opening of the IIId century. The
neo-Platonic system was the prevalent
philosophy of the day at
Alexandria. The issue of the day
was, Is the religion of Christ philosophical?
Can it with safety be
subjected to logical rules? Does it
not contradict the reasonings of
Plato? To meet this issue, so important
to the spread of the Gospel
among the enlightened class, Origen
had recourse as much as was
possible to the tenets of the Platonic
school for arguments. With
Platonic philosophers he had his
controversies; and his language, the
more Platonic it was, the more
power it exerted; the more he reconciled
revelation with reason, in
their estimation, the more entered
within the pale of the church.
Just as in our times able writers
use the popular issues, because the
most intelligible and taking, to dissipate
the clouds of ignorance that
bigotry has thrown around the public
mind in regard to Catholicity,
to show the natural compatibility
of the church with all legal forms
of government, her inexhaustible
resources for meeting the requirements
of society, and her sacred
and impartial maintenance of true
liberty; so, too, did Origen turn to
advantage the doctrines of the
schools in demonstrating the love
of the church for sound philosophy,
her adaptability to the sciences, and
her divine mission as regenerator
of the world. This tincture of
Platonism pervading his early productions,
combined with the mysterious
figures under which Eastern
nations convey sacred truths,
the allegorical style, and the <hi rend='italic'>Discipline
of the Secret</hi>, which was in
active force, rendered Origen obscure,
and his works susceptible of
doubtful interpretation.
</p>

<p>
Though his admirers go so far as
to exculpate him from every error,
we are not prepared to accompany
them to that distance. We are
willing to concede that Origen may
have advanced some erroneous
opinions, but error without contumacy
does not entail the sin of
heresy, which is a wilful rejection
of any revealed truth authoritatively
proposed. <q>I may fall into a mistake,</q>
says the learned S. Augustine,
<q>but I will not be a heretic.</q>
The fathers of the church were
only men, subject to human weakness,
liable to err. The doubtful
and obscure speculative hypotheses
of the Alexandrian's fertile imagination,
then, should in no way
darken the splendor of his genius
or belittle his devotion to Catholic
truth. F. Petau, his declared enemy,
followed by Huet, who gave
his learning to this controversy, refuses
to believe Origen obstinate.
Halloix, Charles Vincent de la
Rue, Tillemont, Witasse, Ceillier,
and other erudite scholars, who
studied with care and impartiality
this whole matter, unite in the
emphatic declaration that Origen
<q>died in the bosom of the Catholic
Church.</q>
</p>

<p>
This is the verdict of great men
<pb n='124'/><anchor id='Pg124'/>
in modern times. It was also the
verdict of the century in which he
lived&mdash;the IIId&mdash;as may be seen in
the apology of S. Pamphilus, composed
in defence of Origen's orthodoxy,
and extant in the works of
S. Gregory Nyssen; also in that
beautiful monument of antiquity,
the panegyric over Origen by S.
Gregory Thaumaturgus, given in
full in the works of Gerard Vossius.
This verdict was confirmed in the
IVth century by the catalogue
of orthodox ecclesiastical writers,
published by S. Gelasius, pope,
among which is the name of Origen;
and in the following century,
in a profession of faith drawn up
by Pope S. Hormisdas, and sent
by Germanus, Bishop of Capua, to
be signed by the Patriarch of Constantinople,
the heretics condemned
by the church are enumerated,
but in this enumeration we can
discover no allusion to the great
Scripturist.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, it has always been a
source of surprise to us how Origen,
a fallible creature, a man like other
men, unaided by any divine assistance,
could have written in several
thousand volumes so much truth,
and so little error. There were
but few Encyclical Letters, no
Index, no decisions of Sacred Congregations,
no <hi rend='italic'>Syllabus</hi>, in the days
of Origen; and yet his enemies
will measure the length of his definitions
with theirs, compare his
expressions with the theological
niceties of the present, and, should
a word be wanting or a synonymous
one substituted, exclaim: <q>There
is an error; Origen is a heretic!</q>
The body of infallible definitions
from popes and councils which we
now possess did not exist at this
early epoch; to write then orthodoxically,
to justify the Christian
belief in the Trinity, to explain the
hypostatic union, the generation of
the Son, and the procession of the
Holy Ghost, to expound the Scripture
and the other sublime mysteries
of religion, and escape with
one or two mistakes, was simply
marvellous. Thus Origen, born in
the true faith, reared in a religious
atmosphere, educated under pious
men, the intrepid defender of truth
and meek retractor of error, the
teacher and companion of saints,
the prisoner for Christ, has impressed
on his life, in golden letters, the
best defence of his orthodoxy.
And if the saintly Origen be distinguished
from the abominable
<hi rend='italic'>Origenians</hi>; if the allowances due
to the age in which he lived be
accorded him, an injustice to the
works of Origen&mdash;a valuable legacy
to posterity&mdash;will be removed, and
the injury done to a reputation
obscured by the malice of some
and the misapprehension of many
others will in part be repaired.<note place='foot'>The question of Origen's orthodoxy turns
principally on the <hi rend='italic'>Periarchon</hi>. The violently
heretical character of that book, as it now stands,
contradicting the most fundamental doctrines of
Christianity, is the best defence of Origen. It
is altogether contrary to the teaching of his undoubted
works, and, if it had been acknowledged
and defended by him, there would never have
been any controversy at all about his orthodoxy.
He would have been at once and universally
condemned as the grossest of heretics.&mdash;<hi rend='smallcaps'>Ed.</hi>

<p>
There is no axiom more fraught
with meaning than the old Scripture
promise, <q>The truth shall make
you free.</q> But there is also no
fact better authenticated in the
civilized world of to-day than the
practical nullification of this very
promise. We speak as regards
things human; for in spiritual
matters, the home of truth is, to our
belief, a fixed one, and the road to
it staked out by a divine leader,
that has power to find an unerring
path in what otherwise seems but
an ocean of shifting sand. We
propose to apply this axiom to
social life, and it is our complaint
that it is <emph>not</emph> free. The pivot on
which <q>society,</q> properly so called,
turns is conventionality&mdash;a polite
term for untruth.
</p>

<p>
The original Christian ideal of
society was of course based on
charity. It has been truly said
that a perfect Christian is instinctively
a finished gentleman. Courtesy
is but an adaptation of charity;
and the height of good-breeding
(recognized as being the faculty
of setting every one at his ease,
and of saying the right thing at the
right time to the right person)
must answer to the Christian principle
that to wilfully wound your
neighbor in the slightest degree is
a sin. But all this, call it tact or
charity, as you will, is not in itself inconsistent
with truth. The French
have a proverb that <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Toute vérité
n'est pas bonne à dire</foreign>&mdash;<q>Every untruth
is not necessarily expedient to
all men;</q> but even that is not a declaration
of war against the principle
of truth in the main. Yet what is
the reality, the thing constantly
before our eyes, the fact of which
no one can doubt who has ever
lived beyond the strictest limits of
home&mdash;nay, beyond the limits of
his own mind? One in a thousand
fulfils the ideal of Christian courtesy,
while the other nine hundred
and ninety-nine wear the regulation-mask
prescribed by fashion.
Some wear it of iron, so that, in the
intercourse of a lifetime, you would
never feel that you knew them any
better than on the first day of acquaintance;
some only of wire, so
that the natural personality behind
it is but partially hidden even
from perfect strangers; some of
silk, so cunningly painted that it
betrays you into thinking it nature,
until, by repeated experience, you
discover the imposture. Again,
some wear it as the women of Constantinople
wear the <foreign rend='italic'>yashmak</foreign>, so
filmy as only to veil, not to conceal,
the features. Lord Lytton, in
his romance, <hi rend='italic'>A Strange Story</hi>, speaks
of the <q>three women</q> which exist
in the single personality of every
woman; this applies to men almost
equally. There is, he says, the
woman as she really is, the woman
as she thinks herself to be, and the
woman as she appears to the world&mdash;the
conventional woman. This is
by far the most curious product of
natural history, or, more appropriately,
of the history of mechanics.
The human being under social
manipulation is a study for philosophers.
Conventional standards
of human beauty, such as the compressed
<pb n='126'/><anchor id='Pg126'/>
foot of the Chinese lady,
or the artificially stimulated rotundity
of form among the women
of some of the Central African
tribes, the staining of the finger-nails
with henna among the Persians,
etc., are as nothing and involve
no deformation or suffering
compared with that among the
wholesale machine-products of civilized
society.
</p>

<p>
Spiritual systems of penance have
sometimes been impugned for aiming
at subduing nature: taming the
passions, restraining the expression
of strong emotion, weaning the
body from innocent indulgences,
and so forth. But is there any
more barefaced destroyer of nature
than <q>society</q> as at present
constituted? Are there any penances
harder, any restraints stricter,
than those imposed by our conventional
code? The spiritual struggle
with nature is voluntary, and
aims at subduing our lower nature,
only the more to honor the intellectual
principle, and render its
exercise freer from clogging and
degrading influences. The conventional
struggle with nature, on
the contrary, is a compulsory one,
into which you are thrust by
others in early and unconscious
childhood; it is, moreover, a deceptive
one, as it tends to produce
mere appearances&mdash;not to tame
passion, but restrain its outward
expression; not to elevate the mind,
but to give it the semblance of
those gifts most profitable in the
social estimation of the day. It
does not tend to make man <hi rend='italic'>super</hi>natural,
but <hi rend='italic'>un</hi>natural. It takes
from him even the freedom of the
savage, without giving him in exchange
the freedom of the Christian.
It aims not at virtue, but at
decorum. Its morality skips the
whole of the Ten Commandments,
but insists upon what facetious Englishmen
sometimes call the eleventh&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>,
<q>Thou shalt not be found
out.</q> It has rites and ceremonials
of its own, more arbitrary than the
law of the land, and, in the same
breath, more lax; it has beliefs and
formulas more binding outwardly
than those of any religion; it has its
own oracles, its own language, its
own tribunals. It is a state within
a state, condoning many moral
delinquencies, exalting some into
meritorious deeds, smoothing others
over as pardonable follies. Where
it is not wicked, it is inane or
spiteful. Slander and gossip are
its breath of life, except in the few
instances where intrigue sweeps
away such second-rate <foreign rend='italic'>passe-temps</foreign>.
</p>

<p>
Yet its wickedness is a subject
that touches us less than its stupidity;
for it is less of a daily experience,
and has more denouncers to
lash it. We also know less of its
brilliancy than of its meanness; for
the latter is visible in the smallest
gathering and in the most insignificant
place, while the former exists
but in half a dozen great capitals,
and even there only among one or
two circles or strata of society.
Paris and Vienna have their dull
and respectable society, as well as
other places, and they are by far
the most numerous, and, we will
venture to say it, the meanest.
Downright license seems, strangely
enough, to carry with it a certain
reckless <foreign rend='italic'>bonhomie</foreign> which, while it is
far from Christian charity, yet has
many outward signs of it. The most
abandoned are often found to be the
most generous, or even philanthropic,
while the pharisaical little-mindedness
of many eminently <q>respectable</q>
members of society is a
constant reproach to the faith on
which they pride themselves. The
<q>milk of human kindness</q> is often
<pb n='127'/><anchor id='Pg127'/>
scarce amid <q>saints</q> of a certain
school. <hi rend='italic'>Noli me tangere</hi> is their
motto, and an appropriate one, indeed;
for you might tap their hearts
till doomsday, and never draw from
them one drop of the generous wine
of sympathy.
</p>

<p>
Not that all persons whose path
of life crosses your own by the
chances bred of social conventionalities
are of this type; many are
generous, kind-hearted, impulsive;
but it is part of the indictment we
bring against <q>society</q> that its
rules so smother this amiable individuality
as seldom to allow it to
be revealed to you save by some
chance occurrence. You may have
a <q>calling acquaintance</q> with a
woman apparently frivolous (though
obviously good-natured), and whose
mind you judge to be probably as
shallow as her conversation. Some
sudden misfortune comes upon you,
and, of all your acquaintances, this
is, perhaps, the only one who will
blossom into a friend. In emergencies,
her native good sense and
affectionate heart burst their artificial
bonds, resume their proper
place, and flow out in deeds of
refined and considerate kindness.
She will prove to have presence of
mind, delicacy of heart, an active
power of sympathy. This is the
sort of woman you would choose
to have by your dying-bed, or to
whom you would consign the care
of your children under unhappy
circumstances, whether of poverty
or absence&mdash;the woman whose nerve
would not fail her in a hospital, and
who would march boldly into a prison
with bright looks and cheerful
words, ever thinking of others before
herself. But had it not been for an
untoward accident, you might never
have distinguished her from the herd
of ordinary morning-callers. She
goes through her part in society as
glibly and cheerfully as your gray
parrot, who is ever ready to repeat
his lesson when the proper cue is
given him, or as readily as your pet
lap-dog, which has no objection to
stand on its hind legs in a corner,
and beg as long as you choose to
hold the titbit up before it. What
chance have you of recognizing a
soul behind all that mass of conventionality?
About as much as you
would have of seeing the <q>angel
imprisoned in the marble</q> in a
sculptor's studio, or as much as
Dante had of knowing the tormented
souls hidden in the trunk
of those grisly bleeding trees of the
<hi rend='italic'>Inferno</hi>.
</p>

<p>
The more frequently and familiarly
you mix with the world, the
more your path is strewn with shattered
ideals; for it is almost impossible
to retain an ideal of anything
which you see daily as a misshapen
and blurred reality. Practical experience
seems to coarsen and
cheapen everything, and there
never was yet a more melancholy
truth than that of the old adage,
<q>Familiarity breeds contempt.</q>
Professional life as well as domestic
furnishes lamentable instances
of this. In commerce, where it is
very difficult for poetry and ideals
to find room, the reality is hardly
obnoxious to the thoughtful
looker-on; for what refining influence
could be expected from the
perpetual jar and clash of engines,
the constant chaffering, the feverish
life, of the exchange? It is the
realm of purely earthly, material influences,
and naturally dwarfs the
sympathies, while it concentrates
the thoughts on one narrow point
of selfish interest, if pursued for its
own sake. But in the learned professions,
whose aims are intellectually
superior, and whose special
province it is to elevate the human
<pb n='128'/><anchor id='Pg128'/>
mind above selfish and individual
interests, leading it, on the contrary,
to the contemplation of abstract
principles, and to the furtherance
of the public weal, the ideal should
be more apparent. And yet, in
most cases, it is not so. There is
no reverence left for a pursuit the
trivial details of which are grown
too familiar; petty jealousies take
the place of scientific or philosophic
emulation; man's innate
vanity soon narrows the circle of
interest round the <emph>ego</emph>, and subordinates
the progress of the world to
personal advancement. There is
scarcely anything less venerable in
a man's eyes than the particular
branch of knowledge in which he is
most proficient; and if it be with
him a hobby, the love he bears to
it is rather a shadow of the good
opinion he holds of himself than a
genuine devotion to science in the
abstract. Of course, there are exceptions,
numerous and honorable,
but such are the plain facts in the
ordinary, every-day experience of
which life is in the main composed.
<q>No one is a hero to his valet.</q>
Home life is another ideal destroyed
by society, with its arbitrary
rules and its hard, practical
axioms. The peace and holiness
of home are rudely jarred by the
demands which fashion makes on
the time of its members. We have
sometimes been tempted to think
that this would be a very pleasant
world to any one who could go
through it as a spectator only. To
act a part in it yourself means to
subject yourself to one disenchantment
after another. You see a
family group at a distance&mdash;say
through a street-window in a large
city, or on the porch of a country
villa. Old and young are mingled
together; there may be beauty
among the girls, there is refinement
in their surroundings; they seem as
thrifty as they are comfortable, for
some are reading and some sewing:
perhaps the tea-table is spread and
housewifely treasures displayed; as
a <emph>picture</emph>, it is perfect. But as a
<emph>drama</emph>? Are you quite sure that
you would like to see the real state
of mind of each person there? If
so, prepare yourself for almost inevitable
disappointment. It will
not be a safe investigation, and the
ideal you may have formed will
probably come out of the trial as
an angel might if he trusted himself
to the rough handling of common
men.
</p>

<p>
No real happiness can exist in a
life of perpetual excitement; and
this a fashionable life can hardly
fail to be. There is an intoxication
of the mind as well as of the senses.
The whirl of so-called pleasure
never satisfies, but stimulates.
More is required, and yet more, till,
like the drunkard, you are a living
paradox, never at peace unless in
an atmosphere of excitement, just
as he may be said to be never sober&mdash;or
at least capable&mdash;unless
when drunk. In the whirl of society,
the mind withers; there is no
time for thought, for study, for application.
How many young girls
there are who tell you candidly,
<q>Oh! I have no time to practise my
music. I used to do so four hours
a day; but since I am in society, I
can never find an hour to myself.</q>
Then you inquire into this multiplicity
of engagements, and you
find&mdash;perhaps some religious occupation,
some charitable work? Oh!
no; only a call to be returned, cards
to be left, a new toilet to be tried
on, a little shopping, and a drive in
the park. Pressing business, truly!

In great cities, during the season
of balls and parties, a girl's life is
one unbroken round of dissipation
<pb n='129'/><anchor id='Pg129'/>
two-thirds of the day, and recuperation
for coming <q>pleasure</q> during
the remaining third. At the end
of four or five months of this life,
vitality is half extinct, the cheeks
are pale, the mouth drawn, the eyes
violet-circled; and against all this
what prize is there to set? A
bubble burst, a shadow vanished!
These continual festivities, beginning
late, ending in the early dawn,
when the poor are just waking to
their toil, and servants of God are
rising to praise him&mdash;these repeated
gatherings called <q>society</q> entirely
upset the routine of domestic life.
Instead of the blithe, healthy face
sparkling at the head of the breakfast-table,
there is a jaded, weary
countenance, pale with a floury
paleness, or flushed by late and disturbed
slumbers; instead of the
brisk tread and ringing voice that
cheer the home, there is the listless
step of the worn-out dancer, the
peevish tone that tells plainly of
bodily fatigue. In the evening
there is no time for a cosy gathering
round the hearth, a quiet
game or chat, the reading aloud of
some interesting book, or the simple
delights of old-fashioned national
airs. The dressing-room absorbs
all that time&mdash;the choice of flowers
or jewels takes long; the last finishing
touches to the toilet must not
be given in a hurry. <emph>The</emph> event of
the day is about to begin; and so
it will be to-morrow and the day
after, and for an interminable tread-mill
of days. If there is innate
talent, there is no time to develop
it; or, if it is cultivated at all, that,
too, is distorted into a mere social
<q>accomplishment,</q> the sole object
of which is to add to the value of
the possessor in the social market.
The champion piece of embroidery

artistic of the family's visiting list.
And, by the way, what more egregious
sham can there be than the
conventional interest in music so
universally professed? It is a matter
of course to exclaim, <q>Oh! I dote
on music</q>; and, on the basis of this
broad assertion, what ludicrous exemplifications
one is condemned to
listen to! One will add, <q>Oh! yes,
and I do so love Strauss' valses</q>;
another will tell you there is no
music like the bagpipes, and no
dance like an Irish jig or an old-time
Virginia reel. One gushing
young lady will call the <q>Maud
Valse</q> and the <q>Guards' Polka</q>
<q>perfectly divine,</q> while her sentimental
friend will murmur that
<q>Home, Sweet Home</q> is her favorite.
With many people, a collection
of ballads is identical with the whole
science of music; their sympathies
and comprehension can go no further.
</p>

<p>
To many, again, <emph>music</emph> stands for
comic songs and Christy's Minstrels.
If an instrumental piece takes more
than five minutes to get through,
people begin to shift their feet and
whisper to their neighbors; of course,
when it is over, they will turn round
and sweetly simper: <q>Oh! do play
us something more; that last was <emph>so</emph>
lovely.</q> In ninety-nine out of a
hundred houses where you are
doomed for your sins to hear
music, you hear trash. It is hardly
worth criticising, either in the
choice or in the execution, and, one
<pb n='130'/><anchor id='Pg130'/>
would therefore think, hardly worth
telling a lie for. And yet this conventional
admiration, what is it but
a lie pure and simple?
</p>

<p>
To return to our belles and their
murdered home-life. Not only is
their time so mortgaged that they
have none left for the joys of the
family hearth, but they have none
to spare for self-culture. A woman's
education does not close
on the threshold of the school-room.
Every advance made later by voluntary
application to study is a
greater stride than all the compulsory
teaching she receives in her
school-life. If society materially
interferes with this self-development,
it has a heavy responsibility
to bear. Each mind thus stunted,
crude, and unevenly balanced reduces
the sum total of usefulness
in this world, and adds to the dead-weight
of shiftless beings whose
room would be decidedly better
than their company in the scheme
of human advancement. A frivolous,
fashionable man or woman is
a monster upon earth, a being
whom nature certainly does not
recognize, and whom religion
reprobates.
</p>

<p>
The most satisfactory reflection
whereby to dispel the effect of this
dismal picture is this: the thing
carries its antidote with it to all
but hopelessly narrow minds. The
pleasures of dancing within an area
of a yard square, and of listening
night after night to the same insipid
gallantries and insincere congratulations,
cannot fail to pall after
a time. A French author says
that after the age of thirty, a
woman of any account does not
dance; she leaves this pleasure to
those who have no other.<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Christine.</hi> Par Louis Enault.</note> As
with all pleasures which address
the senses rather than the intellect,
a surfeit often proves a cure. You
have tasted all the delights to be
got from certain things, and the
sameness at last begins to pall.
There could be no more effectual
check on the levelling spirit of the
age than a voluntary renunciation
for a time on the part of the possessors
of wealth and power, and
a temporary enjoyment of these
honors on the part of those who
envy them. How soon should we
see the harassed artisan fly from the
post he once coveted, the working-girl
tear off the finery she envied,
the millionaire <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>pro tem.</foreign> entreat his
coachman to change places with
him! Those who, in the midst of
their grinding toil, envy the man
in broadcloth, the woman in her
barouche, whom they pass and repass
day by day, quite leave out
of the scales the weight of inner
anxiety, grief, or often only <foreign rend='italic'>ennui</foreign>,
which burdens the rich and fashionable.
If they could tell how
this one's heart is devoured by
jealousy, how that one's home is
rendered gloomy by his too plodding
ambition, or unhappy by his
wife's irritable temper! If they
could guess how that sickly, white
child, seated among its furs in that
dark, handsome clarence, causes
sleepless nights and heavy fears to
that anxious mother in velvet robe
and seal-skin cloak! If they only
knew the secret remorse for ever
gnawing at the heart of this exquisite
of the clubs, whispering the
name of a girl once happy and
innocent&mdash;a name now to him the
synonym of a crime; or if they
could tell the thoughts of the substantial
merchant, as he turns away
with heavy steps from a counting-house
which, the more astounding
is its financial success, the more it
resembles, in all but in name, a
<pb n='131'/><anchor id='Pg131'/>
gambling-den! And, above all, did
they but know how often the sad
votary of fashion, in some moment
of long-repressed but untamable
natural emotion, cries out for the
freedom of the poor and their
robust health! That is the saddest
part of this grim masque&mdash;no one is
contented, no one believes in himself
or in his fellow-man; it is a
drama in which the actors know
full well that when the foot-lights
are put out and the curtain of
night falls, they will no longer be
what they seem. So the gigantic
sham grows day by day, stifling
nature, burying the intellect, blurring
the moral sense, fossilizing the
whole being. Outward shapes of
humanity remain, but, by some fell
enchantment, the spiritual essence
is sucked away, and an automaton,
skilfully contrived, represents what
once was a <emph>man</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Even pleasure no longer lurks in
its outward forms when <q>society</q>
has thus worked its will on men.
The real enjoyment is gone, but its
dismal appearance must be assumed.
Not to shock the world&mdash;your
world&mdash;the flavorless fruit must be
eaten with a good grace, the graceful
draperies of social decorum
must be hung on the skeleton.
The wheel goes round, and it is so
long since you have trusted to
your own feet for guidance that
you must needs keep hold of the
conventional support. It is very
difficult to win back your independence
once it has been surrendered.
The world&mdash;your world&mdash;is a pitiless
task-master, and does not pension
off its former servants. If you
leave it, you do so at your own
risk; and if you can conquer no
position which merit and your own
individuality are enough to gain, you
may resign yourself to the <foreign rend='italic'>rôle</foreign> of a
dummy. We are not sure that
some of the happiest people on
earth are not, socially speaking,
dummies. But when you come to
think of it, what a strange, magnetic
power has the little circle that forms
your world! When a lady has
crowded from five to six hundred
guests in her narrow drawing-rooms,
she sees before her all the persons
who, to her, constitute society. Of
these, perhaps one-third are of
hazy position; they are but outsiders,
candidates for the social
honors which will only be bestowed
fully and ungrudgingly on their
grandchildren. Their opinion is
not of much value. When you
dissect the remaining thirds, you
mentally check off many a respectable
and amiable person as incapable
of forming any independent opinion;
others you secretly stigmatize
as gossips, shallow-minded, or spiteful;
and the circle of responsible
people becomes gradually narrower
and narrower. Hardly a score do
you credit with sound judgment
and discriminating sense. But
these are precisely the judges you
do not fear, unless your conscience
pricks you. They are generous
and large-minded; they stand apart
from the crowd, with wider sympathies
and larger appreciation; they
see beyond the present, and unconsciously
you find yourself classing
them as exceptions to the rule.
They do not form the impalpable
social tribunal, then? It must be,
therefore, the mediocre company
of gossips. Search a little into
your consciousness or your memory,
and you will doubtless find it is so.
A recent novelist gives an apt illustration
of the relative proportion, in
the eyes of an old English country
gentleman, between his county,
England, and the world. A diagram
contains, first, a large, irregular
outline representing the county;
<pb n='132'/><anchor id='Pg132'/>
a round ball ten times smaller
typifies England, and an infinitesimal
point in space denotes the
whole civilized world. This is the
way we all look at things. No
doubt it is instinctive. To us, <q>the
world</q> consists of a hundred old
women, eminently respectable and
unctuously compassionate, who gossip
about our private affairs over
their tea and hot rolls. This is the
core of that dread tribunal which
we tremble to offend. It is indeed
a hard tyrant, if it can succeed in
chaining us to its car, after the
pleasures which it dispenses have
lost their flavor for us. But, unfortunately,
half mankind acknowledge
this species of bondage, and we
must presume voluntarily, or at
least passively.
</p>

<p>
Were it not that this thraldom is
so unspeakably sad, it would seem
such a farce, if looked upon dispassionately
from without! One
might almost liken a ball or great
official reception in one of the capitals
of fashion to the mediæval
Dance of Death. The scene is brilliant
with deceptive gaiety; the
whole surface of society ripples
with smiles; the maskers all wear
their brightest garments and their
stereotyped badges of mirth.
There, in the doorway, stands a
lovely woman, in rose-color from
head to foot&mdash;a cherub's face enshrined
in a sunset cloud, so perhaps
an artist would fancy. She
smiles bewitchingly, and coquets
with her fan, while talking to a
gray-bearded hero from India. But
she has made up her mind to sacrifice
her honor to her love; tomorrow,
at dawn, she will leave her
husband's home and her baby's cradle;
and, poor victim! she is panting
under the weight of this wretched
secret even while she listens to old-world
gallantry from her fatherly
admirer. Not far from her stands
another fair form, not more pure
in outward semblance, hardly less
beautiful&mdash;a gifted woman, a true
wife, smiling and conversing as
calmly as any one in the room; but
she knows that she has a fatal internal
disease, and that at any moment
death might suddenly overtake
her. Not to alarm her husband,
she joins in every festivity,
carrying her secret with her as the
Spartan did the fox who was
gnawing at his bosom. Amid the
whirl of the dance, you perhaps
single out that young girl, fair,
fresh, seventeen. She is not as
happy as she seems; her eyes roam
shyly around; there is one whom
she both longs and dreads to see,
for she is not sure whether she will
not find him by the side of her
school friend, now her rival. And
among the men, how many, beneath
their masks, bear sorrowing or anxious
hearts! That elderly man, so
calmly listening to a fluent diplomate,
knows that to-morrow it will
be noised abroad that he is bankrupt&mdash;utterly
ruined. When he
leaves this gay scene to-night, it
will be for the railway, which will
bear him out of the country in a
few hours. Yonder pale man, who
wears his regulation smile so listlessly
that you cannot help likening
it to a garment loosely hung, is
here in the interest of a friend, and
is waiting an opportunity to speak
a word of cordial recommendation
to a ministerial acquaintance, formerly
a college friend, now a power
in the cabinet. His heart is heavy
with a private grief; his child lies
dangerously ill at home, and his
poor distracted wife needs his comfort
and support; but, true to his
word, he forgets himself for an
hour or two, that he may not miss
the golden opportunity on which
<pb n='133'/><anchor id='Pg133'/>
hang the hopes of his friend's
whole future. In the centre of the
dance, the tall form of a Life-guardsman
is prominent; to-morrow
he will have disappeared from
the world, and only his intimates
will know that he had long determined
to enter a Catholic seminary,
and study for the priesthood. He
did not want his decision discussed
beforehand, and took the best
means of silencing curiosity by
appearing the gayest of the gay.
Every one here to-night has a long
record oppressing his heart&mdash;something
that makes the present scene
quite secondary in his thoughts,
and that causes in his breast a bitter
feeling of reaction against the
mockery of which he forms a part.
And this is the thing called pleasure!
How little we know of the
people with whom we spend our
lives&mdash;those that touch our hands
daily, and speak to us commonplace
words of courtesy! Surely
the bees in their hive, the ants on
their hill, the beavers and prairie-dogs
of a <q>village,</q> know each
other better than we do our next-door
neighbors! We cut the thread
of a guilty reverie by some observation
about the weather, or we
laugh the unmeaning laugh that
supplies the place of an answer,
perhaps inconvenient to ourselves,
and this laugh jars on the tenderest
memories of a sorrowful past
uppermost just then in our neighbor's
mind. There is something
appalling in all this&mdash;the tragedy
lies so near the surface, and we
tread upon it so often!
</p>

<p>
The trivial aspect of society is
oftener still before us&mdash;the inanity
of morning calls, the gossip of a
provincial town, the petty local interests
that absorb three-fourths of
mankind. Why, we wonder, should
general conversation invariably
breed gossip, while a <foreign rend='italic'>tête-à-tête</foreign>
sometimes elicits real information
and rational interchange of ideas?
The same person who in a company
of five or six has nothing but
commonplace remarks to offer, often
opens out in private though yet only
ceremonial conversation, and startles
you by original opinions and
valuable suggestions. The French
are perhaps the only people who
shine in mixed conversation; they
have the talent of <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>causerie</foreign>&mdash;a thing
that with us hardly exists; the very
word is untranslatable. A Frenchwoman
can be sparkling where we
can only be dull; she can dance
on a cobweb, while we should break
down on a cart-rope. Gallic vivacity
can make even the details
of the kitchen amusing, while we
should be insufferably prosy on the
same subject.
</p>

<p>
How well we remember the ponderous
magnates of our neighborhood
in the county! The stately
morning calls, the inevitable topics
of local interest, the solemnity of
that <q>quarter of an hour</q> which
we were fain to liken to that rendered
famous by an old author.
Unfailing resources, O <hi rend='italic'>Court Journal</hi>!
the royal visit to such and
such a place, the marriage of so-and-so,
etc., etc. Then the flower-garden
and the poultry-yard (hereditary
hobbies with English ladies),
the agricultural show, the
coming election. And then the
formidable ordeal comes to an end,
probably to the great relief of both
parties. Neither of the two cared
for the subjects discussed or for the
interlocutor discussing them; but
etiquette demanded the waste of fifteen
minutes, and the laws of society
are as those of the Medes and
Persians. In a lower rank of life,
the proprieties are perhaps still
more rigidly enforced, and the only
<pb n='134'/><anchor id='Pg134'/>
difference would be in the choice
of topics. George Eliot's inimitable
gossip in <hi rend='italic'>The Mill on the Floss</hi>
describes that to a nicety, and indeed,
although written in England,
might do duty almost as well anywhere
else. The quality of the
house linen, the antiquity of the
silver spoons, the solemn conclave
over a new bonnet, and the delinquencies
of the maid-servant&mdash;such
would be the staple. In every case
you see the mask is on, it fits close,
and no form of <q>society</q> is disregarded!
</p>

<p>
Staying for a few days at a
friend's house is a terrible trial in
polite society. You are never a
moment off duty; you have to
change costumes as often as an actress
in a play where the <q>unities</q>
are <q>nowhere</q>; and, above all, if
you are a woman, you have the dismal
prospect of three hours' morning
talk with a bevy of your own
sex, your hands meanwhile engaged
in some useless piece of fancy-work.
The topics of conversation may be
guessed, their range not being very
extensive; of course, somebody's
marriage or probable engagement
is discussed, silks and laces are
made up into imaginary toilets
with surprising rapidity, the history
of some refractory scholar and the
details of the clothing club are next
drawn upon, and it is very seldom
that the talk glides into any interesting
or rational channel. It
really is a pity that people will persist
in talking of each other and not
of <emph>things</emph>. So much might be altered
for the better in society, if conversation
were not so exclusively
personal. Mutual improvement is
a thing altogether overlooked in the
civilized world. Even men succumb
to gossip; for what is the staple
of club-talk? So-and-so has
<q>sold out,</q> and gone into a less
expensive regiment; such an one
seems very attentive to Miss So-and-so;
such another was deeply
offended because he was not asked
to Lady So-and-so's party; the
shooting in Lord C&mdash;&mdash;'s preserves
is confoundedly bad this year;
Mr. A&mdash;&mdash; thinks of contesting
the next election at B&mdash;&mdash;. Interminable
waves of gossip flood
the world from the club as from
the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>boudoir</foreign>, though the latter certainly
does by far the most mischief.
</p>

<p>
We are told that <q>no man can
serve two masters.</q> In all relations
in life this is eminently true.
Intellect and Mammon scarcely
agree better than God and Mammon.
The proper atmosphere of
intellectual life is peace, and a student's
career should be blameless
in morals as well as tranquil in experience.
Fashion and society forbid
this; they necessitate loss of
time, and unsettle the even balance
of the mind. For one who values
his calmness of spirit and his health
of body there is a golden rule, which,
if he weigh all external pleasures by
it, will infallibly secure him the
peace he needs: No pleasure is
safe but that which leaves no regret
behind it on the morrow. Who
has not felt the wretched sensation
left by pleasures not fulfilling this
condition? Who does not remember
the feverish pulse, the troubled
dreams, the vague uneasiness, the
sickly apathy that follow on a night
spent in violent and unnatural
amusement? One wiser than our
generation has said:
</p>

<p>
<q>The desires of sensuality draw
thee abroad; but, when the hour is
past, what dost thou bring home but
a weight upon thy conscience and
a dissipation of heart? A joyful
going abroad often brings forth a
sorrowful coming home, and a
<pb n='135'/><anchor id='Pg135'/>
merry evening makes a sad morning.</q><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Following of Christ</hi>, b. i. c. xix. v. 7.</note>
</p>

<p>
These words, written centuries
ago, contain volumes, and are not
less applicable now than in the
middle ages.
</p>

<p>
We often hear it said that man
is a gregarious animal. He needs
companionship, and clings to his
kind. This it is that induces that
more stirring life which distinguishes
the city from the province; which
quickens the perceptions and enlarges
the sympathies. But the perfection
of the intellectual life is not
found in cities. The world-wide
influences that stir great centres
have locomotive powers that are
superior to the channels of human
contrivance. It needs not the friction
of mind with mind to originate
great ideas or engender great deeds.
The companionship needful for men
of talent lies not in the social circle,
but in the library. As Ruskin has
said in one of his lectures, we
should each of us be proud of being
admitted to the friendship of some
great poet, artist, or philosopher;
and yet we neglect that inner communion
which is open to us at any
moment with the spirits of all the
departed heroes of the mind, whose
choicest thoughts are stored on the
shelves of our libraries. It is true
that the straitened circumstances
of many a scholar keep him chain-bound
within the limits of great,
black, smoky cities; for, since he
cannot possess individually the literary
treasures that are the necessary
food of his intellectual life, he is
obliged to slake his thirst at the
common fountain of the public
libraries and lecture-rooms. But
we were speaking rather of the
ideal, the perfect scholarly life,
which implies a combination of
pursuits. The mind which looks
to the highest products of ancient
and modern thought for its legitimate
<foreign rend='italic'>pabulum</foreign> can never be but
half satisfied with anything less
than perfection in its accessory surroundings.
Such a mind is naturally
allied to a sensitive and imaginative
organization, and the coarse
contrasts between the peaceful study
and the common street-sights of
every large city must necessarily
be painful to it. Even so the petty
gossip and <q>storms in a tea-cup</q> of
a rural centre; for all that is mean
and small is foreign to that calm
atmosphere in which sages and
poets live. Those sages, those
poets, in their day, may have lived,
it is true, among the turmoil and
strife of small interests; but death
and the lapse of time seem to have
bereft them, in our eyes, of any
such disenchantments; we see them
transformed and idealized, and we
gladly aim at reproducing, not their
commonplace lives, but their spiritual
existence. This existence
still survives, and it is to this that
we wish to ally our own. For this
perfection of lofty companionship,
the solitude of a country life is
most conducive, but it must be a
solitude of leisure, of freedom from
conventionalities, and, unluckily, of
at least some degree of wealth.
This latter condition is fulfilled in
so few cases that our ideal remains
but too often unrealized in this
work-a-day world, yet none the less
is it the true and only dignified
ideal of the intellectual life. The
instinct of those born with a spark
of genius will bear us out in this
assertion; no miser longs for wealth
more thirstingly than a book-worm.
There is an innate sympathy with
the outward beauties of nature
which distinguishes the scholar
even more than it does the gipsy.
</p>

<pb n='136'/><anchor id='Pg136'/>

<p>
But, as a crowning condition to the
enjoyment of these beauties, he
must be free from the common
cares and interests of men; he must
walk in a higher sphere than those
whose sympathies cannot mingle
with his; he must walk alone in
spirit, even though his body may
jostle the unthinking crowd. Have
we made our scholar a misanthrope?
Yes, if thereby is meant a hater of
society, with its shams and its stage-like
scenery; no, if you understand
thereby a hater of humankind.
But be sure of one thing: a man
learns to love men more the less he
sees of them, and the more, by their
absence, they leave him his charitable
estimate of their probable
good qualities. No doubt the earth
itself looks fairer from the standpoint
of a fixed star than it does
to-day to any toiling wayfarer on
its rough pathway.

<head>Odd Stories. VI.&mdash;King Ruli.</head>

<p>
Once upon a time there was, on
this side of the Hartz Mountains, a
secret place, where, touching a hidden
spring, you found yourself in a trice
between immense walls of rock,
whence a mysterious person, dressed
in red from top to toe, took you into
a great cavern, the first of a series
of vast caves filled with hogsheads
and tuns of wine and beer, and lighted
up in such a manner that the
brilliant stalactites with which it was
hung sparkled and flashed like the
most precious gems in a jeweller's
dream. The awe inspired by this
scene hardly left you a moment to
observe that the nose of your guide
was even redder than his body, when
you were ushered through another
secret door into the domain of a
grand old castle, the battlements of
which, covered with moss, overlooked
a pastoral valley and its white flocks,
and seemed to rule the landscape,
notwithstanding the presence of
many other castles, as if it were the
house of a monarch. And so it was.
Here dwelt King Ruli, the patron of
minnesingers and jolly cavaliers&mdash;that
stalwart king whose brow, and beard,
and port were the very signs of genial
majesty. Pleasure ruled the
board where he sat; and when the
juice of the Weinberg warmed up in
the blood of the lords and minstrels
in Weinbergland, the ten noble companions
of King Ruli swept the
mystic chords of the harp, and with
voices free sang in echoing strain
their merry roundelay:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<l rend='margin-left: 2'>And rhymers five; come round, come round;</l>

To sounds of cheerful thoughts like
these each royal night wore on, while
the castled lords of hill and valley
feasted at the king's table, and made
merry over jest and story, to the
clinking of many glasses and in the
pleasant uproar of many voices. Seated
in his chair at the head of the
table, he drank from a great flagon
of crystal, or smoked from a pipe as
long as his body, the bowl of which
required a page-in-waiting to support
it, lest, in a drowsy moment, it should
drop from the mouth of the king.
Below him were ranged the ten minnesingers,
who smoked from one
immense bowl of tobacco, having
long stems that led to all their mouths,
whence issued a volume of smoke,
which, as it rose around the great
burning bowl, was like the fume of a
conflagration; and thus betimes the
merry minnesingers sang:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<l rend='margin-left: 2'>In green old Arcady appeared;</l>
<l>And as he drinks, the drink flows down</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>His flowing, streaming beard.</l>

<l rend='margin-left: 2'>And broad his body is and strong.</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 12'>Then sing:</l>
<l>King Ruli, King Ruli! He shall be our king.</l>
</lg>

</quote>

<p>
No king could resist such flattery
as this, and it was with truth that his
minstrels pictured him standing, and,
in a tone of majestic joviality, wishing
the health of the whole company:
</p>

Late in the night the sound of
song and story made for the gentle
monarch a lullaby, and his head rested
on his bosom in slumber, as he
laid down his flagon. Had his chief
minstrel then tickled his great ear, it
would not have waked him up; and
so, seeing that the king had filled
himself with slumber as with the
drugs of Morpheus, his lieges sang:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<l>Then, while our loyal shoulders bear</l>
<l>His burden, thus our burden hear:</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 8'>King Ruli!</l>
<l>The king is dead; long live the king!</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>And live again, King Ruli!</l>
</lg>

</quote>

<p>
But as night after night of song
and wine went by, the king grew
older and older in his cups. Little
he saw or cared that new revellers,
new minstrels, new lords, had one
by one taken the places of old ones,
and that the speech of the new-comers
was loud and hoarse, and their song
ribald and discordant. Those who
remained with him of his old friends
and retainers had gradually imbibed
the character of the latest revellers,
and their potations were deeper
and their jests broader than ever.
Once in a while the king groaned
and complained that his beer was
too bitter; but they so flattered his
jokes, and praised his beard, and
spoke of his noble brow, and his
royal blood, and his glorious voice,
that he sang and roared as of old,
and swallowed his beer without further
complaint. On such an occasion as
this it required the cynical courage
of the minstrel Knipfenbausenstein
to sing, as he did, from the end of
the hall, which he had just entered
after a long absence:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<lg>
<l>There were ten vintners old and sick,</l>
<l>And all their wine had gone to lees;</l>
<l>Of empty casks they made them cells:</l>
<l>Oh! very bitter folks were these.</l>
<l>Misgives me now, good friends, to think</l>
<l>A king should be a king of drink.</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 8'>But sing:</l>
<l>Ruli, King Ruli! this night shall be our king!</l>
</lg>

</quote>

<p>
The minstrel doubtless had in
mind the ten companions of the king,
who, being no longer able to keep
up with the stalwart Ruli in the vigor
of his potations, had cried out as
with one voice against their sovereign,
declaring that his beer was
bitter beyond endurance, and his
pleasures a gilded despotism. For
this offence the king, swearing roundly
that they were traitor knights, who
knew not how to be moderate drinkers
or loyal feasters, consigned them
to his darkest wine caverns, where
they were doomed to dwell in empty
hogsheads for many a year.
</p>

<p>
Now, after a life of good living,
the rare old king sat in his great velvet-cushioned
chair, warming his
legs, which were rather swollen,
and his feet, which were encased in
large slippers, before a fire sufficient
to cook an ox. Glided to his side
his eldest child, the queenly Hermengilde,
and said softly: <q>Alas! sire,
and hast thou not heard that my
first-born has killed young Siegbert
of Bierhalle, in a drunken brawl, and
wilt thou persist in these foolish
feasts?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tut, tut, silly girl! This feasting
hurts not thy fasting. 'Twere better
to kill his man in drink than sober;
and, tut, tut! we must not grieve for
ever, child. Wine is for the drinking,
and life for the living. Heaven send
thee luck!</q> With this the jovial king
took a draught from his flagon.
</p>

<p>
Ere he had smoked his pipe, the
fair Joanna, second princess of the
blood, whose wont it was to fill the
king's pipe with affectionate care,
said to him musingly: <q>Methinks it
is the night when our brother Max
fell over into the chasm and was
killed. Ill befits that its peace be
marred by roysterers whom, say
they, he had most to blame for his
death.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What! and have ye turned dames
<pb n='139'/><anchor id='Pg139'/>
of the cloister, that ye seek to make
crows' nests of my beard and gray
hairs? Umph! my lady counsellors;
and ye would have no more wine
drank because rocks are steep! Did
not sober Hans fall into the well,
and ere thou wast born? Ay, but a
brave lad was Max, and a merry one.
A glass to his memory!</q>
</p>

<p>
The king was unaware, as he thus
spoke, of the near presence of a reverend
and noble matron, whose face
bore marks of care and grief. It was
the queen Roxalana. A child of
tender years ran from her side to
climb her grandsire's knee, but, seeing
that the royal flagon stood in the
way, exclaimed: <q>O grandfather!
that horrid drink!</q> The king, with
a majestic motion, waved the child
away, and she returned in tears to
the side of the mute queen.
</p>

<p>
<q>So, my lady, queen of woebegones
and nurse of whimperings,
thou art here to tease thy lord and
trouble his gout. 'Tis well. Train
the brats of the land to do imps'
work to their fathers, and make your
daughters have long faces; but have
a care, goodwife, lest an old man's
patience be too weak for this old
maid's gossip. Pray, what new worm
is in thy brain, that thou tellest we
must not drink the cup of our fathers?</q>
</p>

<p>
Not long after this scene, a loud
clash of arms was heard in the court,
and the debauched minnesinger, Wittekind,
staggered into the hall, his face
stained with blood as with wine. The
king's guests had just drunk their tenth
glass, when a crowd of rioters, armed
to the teeth, rushed in upon them,
and, breaking glasses right and left,
proclaimed the downfall of King Ruli.
With a bitter and heavy heart, the
king recognized among the crowds
who now drank to his perdition many
of his old revellers; and, seizing a
favorable moment, fled totteringly into
the wine mountain. There, to his
great surprise, he found that all the
tuns and hogsheads of wine and beer
which had been stored away were
quite empty. Once more he joined
his ten companions locked up in the
wine caves, lamenting bitterly that
the wine of his life had gone to lees,
and much tormented by the man in
red, whose nose was like fire.

<head>Old Versus New.</head>

<p>
One pleasant afternoon, in the
autumn just passed, I lay stretched
out lazily on a mow of new-mown
hay, in a large, old-fashioned country
barn.
</p>

<p>
It was still redolent with that
odor peculiar to hay newly cut,
having been placed in the barn but
a few hours before.
</p>

<p>
In the work of cutting, raking,
and storing, patent machines of
every description had assisted; and,
lying there cosily enjoying the effect,
I had plenty of leisure to think
upon the cause.
</p>

<p>
With my mind full of reflections
on the wonderful improvements of
the age, and vague thoughts of
labor-saving machines, it was not
long until I was off in a sound
slumber, to which a hearty dinner
had by no means indisposed me. I
was soon in the theatre of dreams,
and the first actor whose voice I
heard was an old scythe. Apparently,
the peg on which he hung
was rotten, and, giving way, let the
old fellow fall with a shock that
seemed to stir up what little life yet
remained in him; for I soon heard,
in a queer, cracked voice, the following
complaint:
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, here I am at last! Hung
up on the wall years ago, like an
old coat that's put aside for a rainy
day, my master couldn't even see
to it that I had a safe peg; but,
hanging me on that old rotten
thing, I've got a fall that my poor
bones won't be the better of for a
month to come.</q>
</p>

<p>
With that, one of the patent
mowers, showing his polished teeth,
gruffly asked: <q>What are you
growling about? What's that you're
saying about the master?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It ill suits you,</q> said the scythe,
<q>to put on airs, though you are
rubbed and polished, and, drawn
by a dashing team, ride about on
wheels. Upstarts always assume
great importance, and the latest
converts are the most zealous partisans;
when you have served the
master as long and as faithfully as
I have, you may have some right to
maintain his cause.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why,</q> said the mower, <q>you're
quite a preacher, to be sure; pray
tell us what cause <emph>you</emph> have for
grievance? Is it, forsooth, because
your peg gave way you are so
highly incensed? Even if you did
get a fall, I think you ought to be
grateful that you are housed high
and dry, and not left out in the
rain to rust.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My fall is a small matter indeed,</q>
said the scythe, <q>compared
with my other wrongs. When
I see you, with your gay paint and
glittering teeth, eating up the food
that I enjoyed for years; when I
see fair meadows of clover, and
valleys filled with golden grain, all
given over to your rapacious maw,
and I, I who once received all
this as my just right, allowed but
the little scraps that grow around
a stump&mdash;when I see all this, my
temper is tried to the utmost at the
injustice that is done me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> chimed in an old and
well-nigh toothless rake, <q>you
may well complain of the scanty
share that is doled out to you; I
<pb n='141'/><anchor id='Pg141'/>
too, hang here neglected, and, when
I am taken down, get equally tough
morsels for my poor teeth.</q>
</p>

<p>
Whereupon several hoes, filled
with deadly hate against their
enemies of the plough family, now
took courage, as they heard the
boldly uttered words of their companions,
and, speaking up with one
voice, said: <q>We likewise have
reason to complain of our master.
There was a time when we were
thought fit for any labor; we turned
up the earth to support the potato-vines;
we loosed the earth
around the corn; and that splendid
vegetable, the cabbage, was tended
by our trusty blades; now we are
deemed fit for scarce anything but
to clean out manure, to scrape offal
from the yard, and, in fact, do all
the dirty work of the place.</q> It
seemed as if the spirit of rebellion
was abroad; for at this, the flail
that hung idly on a spike followed
with a long speech.
</p>

<p>
<q>You have all,</q> said the flail,
<q>good reasons for being indignant
with the master of this farm; my
friend, the scythe, may justly complain
of the rich harvests given over
to his rival, the patent mower; our
old companion, the rake&mdash;an exceptional
rake, by the way&mdash;may consistently
inveigh against the master
for giving him in his old age naught
but the hardest morsels of food;
and our worthy associates, the hoes,
may well be indignant, and look
with contempt and scorn on the
foul legacy bequeathed to them&mdash;a
legacy which hoes of their stamp
should disdain to embrace. But
he has treated none of you so cruelly
as he has treated me; forced into
a disagreeable union with what he
calls my handle, battered almost to
pieces in battering out his grain, I
yet respected him for the care he
took of me in the months when I
was useless to him. But now he
has new-fangled machines to do his
work, and, uncared for and unnoticed,
dust covers me so completely
that I can scarce open eyes or
mouth. Base ingratitude has been
my portion, and I certainly may be
excused if I feel displeased, ay, enraged.
I may be pardoned if I seek
not simply redress, but revenge.</q>
As the flail ended, a deep murmur
of assent filled the whole place;
and the patent mower, who had
kept strict silence since his last
question to the scythe, now spoke
up.
</p>

<p>
<q>My worthy friends,</q> said he, <q rend='pre'>I
am indeed very sorry to be, with
my companions, the innocent cause
of all your troubles. I have listened
to your complaints, and cannot
deny that they are, in the main,
just. But you should know that
the master seeks only his own comfort,
and, whatever care he takes
of us, it is only to relieve himself
from labor. As I reflect upon
your present position, I see myself
similarly situated; for the time
will come when I and my associates
will have to stand aside for
newer and more vigorous servants
of toil.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The master, too, will one day
find himself in the same condition.
He also will become old, and will
look around on younger and heartier
hands doing his work; and, as
he grows still older, he must suffer
many a slight, for the world wants
nothing it cannot use.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Now that the period of <emph>your</emph>
usefulness has gone by, strive to
become reconciled to your fate;
murmur no more, accept your lot
with resignation, be satisfied with
the work you have done, and patiently
wait for the end.</q>
</p>

<p>
Curious to hear how the malcontents
would take this bit of philosophy,
<pb n='142'/><anchor id='Pg142'/>
I leaned over to catch the
first word; but, leaning too far, I
slid off the mow, and falling, not on
the floor, fortunately, but on some
bundles of straw, was rudely awakened
to find that I had been
asleep some hours; for evening had
come on, and it was now so dark
in the barn that I could see nothing
of the bold disputants of my
dream.
</p>

<p>
Hastening to the house, I amused
the family by the recital of this
contest of the old against the new;
and, profiting by my dream, I have
since resolved to accept the mower's
advice, and be always reconciled to
time's changes.

<p>
The history of the Society of Jesus is
rich in abundant materials of untiring interest.
The Blessed Peter Favre's apostolic
career was short, having been but
of seven years' duration, yet crowded with
astonishing results. The particular fact
most strikingly brought into view in this
<hi rend='italic'>Life</hi> is the one which of all others is the
most shameful for the Reformation&mdash;viz.,
that it had no intellectual or moral origin
or character, but sprang merely from the
sins and vices which had so frightfully
corrupted a vast number of all classes of
Christians in the miserable XVIth century.
F. Favre saw this clearly, and often
said that if Luther himself could have
been brought to sincere contrition and
repentance for his sins, his errors in doctrine
would have disappeared without
any argumentation. Accordingly, he set
himself to preach like a missionary, to
exhort and win persons to a reformation
of life, and to labor with wonderful success
to convert sinners to God, as the
shortest and surest way to check the progress
of heresy.

New York: P. O'Shea. 1874.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Seton is a nephew of the celebrated
foundress of the American branch
of the institute of the Daughters of Charity,
and a brother of the Rt. Rev. Monsignor
Seton. He served with honor as
an officer of one of our New York regiments
during the late war, and since that
time has especially devoted himself to
the study of early New England history,
which he has illustrated by his historical
novels. Our first impression respecting
the merits of a previous novel by Mr. Seton,
in which he took great pains to depict
the manners and customs of the early
Puritan inhabitants of Connecticut and
Massachusetts (the <hi rend='italic'>Romance of the Charter
Oak</hi>), was not very favorable. We
have since been disposed to think that
we did not duly appreciate the skill and
talent of the author, and have found other
persons, well qualified to judge of such
matters, who have considered the <hi rend='italic'>Charter
Oak</hi> as a remarkably successful effort
of its kind. Both that novel and the
present one are characterized by a marked
realism, like that of a certain Dutch and
Flemish school of painting. Probably
they do present a more correct and faithful
picture of those old times than that
given by writers who have more idealism
and romance in their delineation, like
James F. Cooper. We confess to a taste,
<pb n='143'/><anchor id='Pg143'/>
nevertheless, for these more romantic authors.
And, speaking in cool criticism,
we think a novelist, in following the
highest principles and ends of his art,
ought to idealize more than Mr. Seton is
disposed to do. He has a broad sense
of the humorous and ridiculous in commonplace
characters and actions. The
absurdities and trivialities of common
life are too faithfully represented in his
pages, and there is frequently a degree
of coarseness in the description of vulgar
persons which is disagreeable. Yankee
children, however, devour Mr. Seton's
stories with avidity, which is a good
proof of their naturalness. And, putting
aside the peculiarity which we have noticed,
the story lately published, <hi rend='italic'>The
Pride of Lexington</hi>, is, even more than the
first one, a composition of real originality
and power, establishing fully the author's
ability as a historical novelist. The battles
of Lexington and Bunker Hill are
well described; the heroes, and especially
the heroine, of the story, with the plot of
private incidents and events that make
the filling up of the historical scenes, are
interesting; there is much genuine comic
humor in the by-play, especially in the
episode of Billy Smith and the black
coon, called <q>the parson,</q> and we are
quite sure that the genuine, unsophisticated
children of the by-gone generation
of New England forefathers, if they get
hold of <hi rend='italic'>The Pride of Lexington</hi>, will pay
the author the tribute of an oft-repeated
and delighted perusal.

By the Rev. Father de Ravignan, S.J.
Translated from the French by Mrs.
Abel Ram. London: R. Washbourne.
1873. (New York: Sold by The Catholic
Publication Society.)
</p>

</quote>

<p>
F. de Ravignan was undoubtedly an
orator. The impression which he made
upon his hearers is enough to justify us
in making this assertion. The orator
must be heard; when his words are written,
their fire is gone, and they no longer
burn. In the case of F. de Ravignan especially,
there must have been much in
the magnetism of the man, in his earnestness,
in his deep religious feeling, in the
firm conviction and strong love, shown
in the manner in which he spoke; for in
his printed conferences and sermons we
do not find great eloquence or beauty of
diction or depth of thought. There are
none of those bursts of passion, of those
profound thoughts and comprehensive
views, in which a whole subject is condensed
into a single phrase, as strong as
it is striking, which we so often meet
with in the conferences of Lacordaire.
Nor yet is there that stately flow of language,
at once simple and majestic, that
evenness of style and unbroken sequence
of thought, which characterize the discourses
of F. Felix. And yet neither Lacordaire
nor Felix excited greater enthusiasm
or made a profounder impression
in the pulpit of Notre Dame than De
Ravignan.
</p>

<p>
If he had not the depth and comprehensiveness
of thought of the one, or the
sonorous diction and lofty manner of the
other, he must have been, in some respects
at least, a greater orator than
either. The conferences contained in
the volume now before us were preached
to the <q>Enfants de Marie,</q> in the Convent
of the Sacred Heart, in Paris, during
the years 1855, 1856, and 1857. They
were not written out by F. de Ravignan,
but were compiled by one of his hearers
from notes taken at the time of their delivery,
and are, we think, equally as
good as the conferences preached in Notre
Dame from 1837 to 1846, which were
published in four volumes shortly after
his death. They are simply familiar discourses
to ladies in the world on the
most important subjects connected with
their duties as Christians; in which we
find all the best qualities that distinguished
F. Ravignan as a preacher&mdash;sincere
piety and much earnestness, united
with delicacy and refinement both of
thought and language. He does not inveigh
against the vices of society, but
rather seeks to describe the beauties of
the Christian life; to show its dignity
and responsibilities, its perfect harmony
with the highest aspirations of the soul
and the soundest dictates of reason.
</p>

<p>
The name of F. de Ravignan will of
itself be sufficient to obtain a wide circulation
for this English version of his conferences.

constructed on the plan of an itinerary,
and divided into nine <q>walks,</q> in which
the most notable localities are looked at
from an archæological point of view, re-peopled
by the actors on the stage at the
respective dates, and reanimated by the
deeds then being performed.

<p>
We are doubtless indebted to the famous
romance of Eugene Sue for these
notes of the Wandering Jew, in which
this extraordinary personage, after his
ceaseless journeyings for more than eighteen
hundred years, finally turns up as
an author, and, surprising as it may seem,
a defender of the Jesuits.
</p>

<p>
The first part of the little volume is
devoted to S. Ignatius. The Wandering
Jew had seen him on two occasions&mdash;first
in Spain, in his hot youth, with his light,
graceful form clad in a page's rich attire,
with the plumed cap and velvet
mantle, the hawk upon his wrist, the
hounds following at his heels, whilst his
foot seemed hardly to touch the ground
as he walked; and again, at Rome, he
saw him in his old age, arrayed in the
flowing gown of the priest, with the calm
of deliberate wisdom on his high forehead,
advancing with a sweet and awful
majesty to the altar.
</p>

<p>
<q>I loved and revered him then,</q> says
the Jew, <q>albeit a stranger to his communion;
and I cannot recall the memory
of that marked and expressive countenance,
whether in the gallant boy or the
venerable and saintly old man, without
feeling some interest in the fate of that
illustrious order which he alone created,
and which still bears the impress of his
character and genius.</q>
</p>

<p>
The remaining chapters are devoted to
<hi rend='italic'>The Spiritual Exercises</hi>, <q>The Constitutions
of the Order,</q> <q>The Missions and
Schools of the Jesuits,</q> and, finally, to answering
some of the charges which Protestants
and infidels have brought against
the Society. There is a very good chapter
on the <hi rend='italic'>Provincial Letters</hi>, in which Pascal,
with a wit and power of sarcasm surpassed
only by the artful unfairness with
which he treats the subject, has sought to
make the whole order responsible for the
extravagant opinions of some few Spanish
and Flemish Jesuits.
</p>

<p>
The author, who is evidently not a
Catholic, has written with great fairness
and good sense, and we most willingly
recommend his book to our readers.

We have been asked to notice this

it with favor, when, before they have read
far in the poem of <q>The Red Flag,</q> they
come upon a passage containing an insult
too gross and slanderous, we should
have thought, for even Exeter Hall? We
forbear to quote the words. Suffice it to
say that the author, ignoring the martyred

the church as gloating over the execution
of the communists in Paris.

Affectation, verboseness, and sensuous

<head>The Coming Transit Of Venus.</head>

<p>
This year, 1874, bids fair to be
memorable in the annals of astronomy.
A subject which has long
occupied our students of that venerable
and now gigantic science is
gradually passing from their closets
and their scientific discussions into
reviews and newspapers, and is forcing
itself on the attention of the
world at large. At first sight the
matter seems a very trivial one.
On the 8th of next December, keen
eyes in certain parts of the world
may, if the sky be clear, and if they
look closely, notice that a small, dark
spot, a mere speck, will flit across
the face of the sun. Examined
through a telescope, it is seen to have
an appreciable diameter&mdash;about 1'.
It is not half as interesting to
look at as ordinary solar spots, with
their jagged edges, their umbra and
penumbra, their changing forms, and
their whirling faculæ. It has not, as
they seem to have, some vague connection
with the magnetic disturbances,
the auroral lights, or any other
atmospheric changes of this sublunary
world of ours. It simply
passes across the sun in something
less than six hours, leaving no trace
behind, and producing, so far as
would appear, no appreciable effect
of any kind. It occurs but rarely&mdash;twice
in a century; in some centuries,
not at all. Small as it is, it
can be foretold and calculated beforehand.
Except as a verification
of such calculations, ordinary minds
might think it singularly unimportant&mdash;scarcely
more important than
the gleam in the heavens at night
of an occasional and isolated falling
star, which glides along its shining
path for an instant, and then
disappears never more to be seen.
</p>

<p>
Yet for the last ten&mdash;we might,
with more truth, say for fifty&mdash;years
back, the best astronomers have
been preparing to observe, with unequalled
care, the passage of that
little black spot. Some have again
and again gone over the records of
the observations made in 1761 and
1769, when it was last seen, criticising
what was then done, distinguishing
what was well done from
what they judge to have been faulty,
<pb n='146'/><anchor id='Pg146'/>
and tracing these faults back to
their sources&mdash;either to the imperfection
of the instruments used, to
personal errors, or to mistakes or
omissions of the observers themselves.
In the observations now to
be made, all these sources of error
will, as far as possible, be excluded.
Others have spent years in patiently
going over the long calculations
connected with those observations,
detecting and eliminating any errors
they find, and introducing such
corrections as the subsequent advance
of astronomical science demands.
The amended results thus
obtained are ready for comparison,
at their proper value, with the additional
and, it is hoped, better results
to be obtained from the observations
of next December. Still others
have used, and are now using, their
utmost skill in constructing instruments
of hitherto unequalled excellence
for the great occasion.
Besides great improvements in the
instruments known in 1769, they
have devised others, perhaps more
valuable, and of a character then
not dreamed of. Others, again,
have devoted months to the nicest
and most intricate calculations of
the movements of the earth and the
planets, in order to know in full
time beforehand what special stations
on the surface of the earth
will, that day and at the required
hours, afford the most eligible positions
from which to make the desired
observations.
</p>

<p>
Finally, governments have been
appealed to, to aid in preparing the
means and in bearing the expense;
and they have responded. Every
civilized nation is acting in the matter.
Russia leads off with, as we
are assured, twenty-seven stations,
mostly on her own territory, all
duly provided with instruments
and observers. France, England,
and Germany will have ten or a
dozen each. Austria will have her
quota. Belgium, Holland, Denmark,
and Italy will establish stations
and send observers and instruments.
Even distracted Spain
is at least talking of it. From the
Western World, the United States
will send eight corps. Nor will
Brazil, Peru, and Chili prove laggard.
The whole civilized world
seems to move in this undertaking
with a singular unanimity, doing
what only governments can do.
Many of the stations must be in
bleak and inhospitable lands beyond
the confines of civilization.
They will be furnished with all that
is needful, and thousands of miles
of telegraphic wires will be stretched
to put them in connection with
the observatories of Europe. Other
stations will be on distant islands
in mid-ocean. Thither national
vessels will bear the observers
and their instruments. It were
well for the world if governments
would manifest such generous rivalry
in doing good when other and
more important interests than those
of astronomy are in question.
</p>

<p>
What, then, is that little black
spot which they are so anxious to
examine as it passes across the
sun next December? How comes
it to be of such importance that all
these mighty efforts are made to
have it fully and correctly observed?
To what great results, scientific
or other, will a correct knowledge
of everything about it lead
the world?
</p>

<p>
That little black spot is the planet
Venus, then passing directly between
the earth and the sun, and
producing an homœopathic solar
eclipse, just as, under similar circumstances,
the moon might produce
an annular or a total solar
eclipse. As ordinarily seen in her
<pb n='147'/><anchor id='Pg147'/>
character of morning or evening
star, Venus shines more brightly
and joyously in the heavens than
any other star. But on this occasion
the whole of her illuminated
half is turned towards the sun.
Towards the earth she shows only
her dark, unillumined half, which
even looks darker by contrast with
the bright face of the sun, on which
it is projected. This passage across
the sun is called the transit of Venus.
If the observations are successfully
made, they will give us
the means of ascertaining with sufficient
precision what as yet is not
so known&mdash;the actual distance of
the earth from the sun.
</p>

<p>
This knowledge is all-important
in a scientific point of view. From
it we can deduce the distance of
every other planet of the solar
system. With it we can carry our
survey beyond that system into the
stellar world. The distance of our
earth from the sun&mdash;the orbital
radius of the earth, is, for the astronomer,
his unit of measure&mdash;his
yard-stick, as it has been termed&mdash;when
he would estimate or measure
stellar distances or velocities. Any
error in it is multiplied millions of
times in such surveys. Any uncertainty
or reasonable apprehension
of error about it casts a cloud of
embarrassment over almost every
portion of the newly acquired domain
of astronomy. No wonder,
then, that no effort is spared to secure
as soon as possible, and in the
easiest and most certain way we
know of, an accurate solution of
the question. This, more than
anything else, is the spring of the
whole movement.
</p>

<p>
The earth, as all know, revolves,
as do the other planets, round the
sun, not precisely in a circle, but
in an oval or ellipse not differing
much from a circle. The length
of our year, or time of one complete
revolution of the earth around the
sun, is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes,
49.657 seconds.
</p>

<p>
Inside the earth, and next to us,
among the planets, comes Venus,
revolving around the sun in her
elliptical orbit in 224 days, 16
hours, 48 minutes, and 42 seconds.
</p>

<p>
Were both orbits on the same
level, in the same plane, Venus and
the earth would come to be in the
same direction or line from the sun
as often as Venus, moving on her
inner and shorter course, and more
rapidly, would overtake the more
sluggish earth. Such conjunctions
would happen once in every 584
days nearly; and every such conjunction
would show a transit, and
Venus could be seen between the
earth and the sun. But the orbits,
though both around the same sun,
are not on the same level. That
of Venus is somewhat tilted up or
inclined, so that one-half of it lies
above the level of the earth's orbit,
and the other half sinks correspondingly
below. The line where the
orbits cross or intersect each other
is the nodal diameter, the only one
common to both orbits. Venus
overtakes the earth regularly, but
ordinarily elsewhere than on or in
the immediate vicinity of this
nodal line. The planet then, in
her apparent journeying from one
side of the sun to the other, generally
seems to pass near that luminary,
either to the north or the south
of it. But whenever, as sometimes
happens, Venus overtakes the
planet on the line of the nodes,
either as she is descending on her
orbit on one side, or ascending on
the other, then the planet is seen to
pass across the sun, and there is a
transit. It is not necessary that
Venus should be precisely on the
line uniting the earth's centre to
<pb n='148'/><anchor id='Pg148'/>
the sun's centre. The apparent
size of the sun, 32' in diameter, and
the size of the earth, and the smallness
of the angle of inclination
between the orbits, all combine to
give a little latitude in the matter.
The earth arrives punctually every
year at one end of this line in June,
and at the other in December.
The astronomical question is, When
will Venus be there also at the
same time? To answer requires a
calculation which appalls. First,
there is the planetary velocity proper
of Venus, varying according as
in the various parts of her elliptical
orbit she is nearer to or further
from the sun. Then there are the
influences of planetary attraction&mdash;the
earth and the other planets
acting on Venus, accelerating or
retarding her movements, and tending
sometimes to draw her to one
side of her orbit. Then there is or
may be question of that nodal
diameter shifting its position, and
trying, as it were, to swing round
the circle of the earth's orbit.
When all these calculations have
been made, the diurnal movement
of the earth must be taken into
account, and the geography of her
surface must be duly studied, to
determine finally when the transit
will take place, across what portion
of the sun's face the planet will be
seen to travel, and from what portion
of the earth's surface that
transit can be seen, and where in
that portion stations for observing
it can be placed with the greatest
probability of success.
</p>

<p>
It is a fearful sight even to look
over a seemingly endless series of
pages all bristling with serried
columns of figures, broken every
now and then by mysterious formulas
of higher calculus, like a
group of officers commanding a
brigade. Mathematicians and astronomers
may delight in them;
we shall be satisfied to take the results.
</p>

<p>
The transits of Venus go in
pairs eight years apart. There
can be only one pair to a century;
some centuries will have none.
The pairs occur alternately in June,
as Venus descends from the upper
to the lower half of her orbit, and
in December, as she ascends again
from it. Thus there were transits
in December, 1631, and December,
1639. A second pair occurred in
June, 1761, and June, 1769. A
third pair is near at hand, in December,
1874, and December, 1882.
The next century will have none.
The fourth pair will appear in June,
2004, and June, 2012.
</p>

<p>
So much on the character of that
dark little round spot, the passage
of which across the sun hundreds
of astronomers, with all manner of
telescopes, spectroscopes, and photographic
instruments, will watch,
examine, measure, and record, as
they see it sweeping on in its course
on the 8th of next December.
What will be the special purpose
animating observers as they view
the transits of 2004 and 2012&mdash;if,
despite the prophetic and apocalyptic
Dr. Cumming, the world lasts
till then&mdash;no one can now tell.
Astronomy by that time may be
advanced as far beyond the present
state of the science as the present
state surpasses the state of two
centuries ago. It is probable that
new and, to that generation, most
interesting questions may have then
arisen, which they will strive to
solve by their observations of the
transits&mdash;questions now perhaps
undreamed of. But at present our
astronomical world is deeply impressed
with the advantage and
necessity of definitely ascertaining
the distance of the earth from the
<pb n='149'/><anchor id='Pg149'/>
sun. This is the paramount,
though by no means the only, purpose
of all this expenditure of time
and skill and money in preparing
for, in making the observations, and
afterwards in laboriously working
out the results.
</p>

<p>
How, by merely looking never so
attentively at an object whose distance
you do not know, as it stands
in a line with, and perhaps far in
front of, another, likewise of unknown
distance, you can tell how
far off that second object is, may
seem as difficult as the king's requirement
of the prophet first to
tell him the dream he had forgotten,
and then to explain its meaning.
It might seem almost an impossibility;
but a few words will explain
how the difficulty is turned
by availing ourselves of other data.
</p>

<p>
When two planets, as is the case
with the earth and Venus, both
revolve in elliptical orbits around
the sun, in virtue of the law of
gravitation, then their respective
times of orbital revolution are to
each other as the cubes of their
respective mean distances from the
sun.
</p>

<p>
This is one of the laws of Kepler.
It was announced by him as the
wonderful result of seventeen long
years of calculations. He took
the data given by the observations
of Tycho Brahe and of others, and
those made by himself. He tried,
by every imaginable form of arithmetical
supposition, to combine
them together somehow, and under
the form of some mathematical law.
This was his last result, perhaps
the most surprising result of
hard plodding, long-continued
labor in the field of science.
All honor to his memory. There are
few discoveries in the mathematics
of astronomy to be compared to
this and the other laws of Kepler.
He established them as experimental
facts. The mathematical reason
of them he did not learn.
</p>

<p>
Since his day, gravity has been
discovered to be the bond which
binds the solar system together,
and its laws have been studied out.
The differential and integral calculus,
also discovered and perfected
since his day, has enabled the
scholar to grapple with intricate
questions of higher mathematics,
which, without its aid, would have
remained insoluble. Availing
themselves of the laws of gravity
and of the aid of the calculus, astronomers
have been able to give
us a mathematical demonstration
of Kepler's laws, which, from being
mere isolated facts or numerical
coincidences, have passed into the
realm of scientific truths.
</p>

<p>
Now, we know the length of our
own year&mdash;365.2422414 days; we
know also the length of the year
of Venus&mdash;224.70048625 days. If
we divide the former by the latter,
square the quotient, and then extract
the cube root of this quotient,
we shall obtain the number which
indicates the proportion between
the two mean distances. Applying
this, we learn that if the distance
of the earth from the sun
be taken as 100,000,000 miles, the
mean distance of Venus will be
72,333,240 miles. And consequently,
when they are in the same direction
from the sun, and supposing
both to be at their mean distances
from that luminary, the distance
between them must be, according
to the same proportion, 27,666,760
miles. It is obviously enough to
know the actual value of either of
those three distances to learn very
easily the other two. The observations
of the transit are intended
to ascertain the last and smaller
one. How this is done, and what
<pb n='150'/><anchor id='Pg150'/>
difficulties are to be surmounted
in doing it, we shall see further on.
Just now we will remark that supposing
the observer to have ascertained
to the very furlong this distance,
during the transit, between
the planets, he must still do much
before he can apply his proportion.
That holds good only for the mean
distances. There are only two
points in the orbit or ellipse of
each planet around the sun which
are at the mean distance from that
focus. Were those points for both
planets to be found on the lines of
the nodes, the matter would be
easy. But it is not so. In June,
the earth is approaching her greatest
distance; in December, she is
nearing her smallest distance from
the sun. A similar embarrassment
exists for the orbit of Venus. But
the astronomer can bravely grapple
with this double difficulty. He
has learned the eccentricity and
consequent shape of each ellipse,
and he can calculate how far, proportionately,
the actual distance
of either planet, at any given point
of its orbit, exceeds or falls short
of the true mean distance. Such calculations
have to be made for the
earth and for Venus as they will
stand on the 8th of next December.
When this is done, the astronomer
is at liberty to make use
of the actual distance learned by
observation, and to apply the Keplerian
formula.
</p>

<p>
But perhaps the question suggests
itself, why take all this trouble
of a circuitous route? Why not
measure the distance of the sun directly,
if such things can be done at
all? If it is possible to measure the
distance of Venus by observations,
surely the sun, which has an apparent
diameter thirty times as great,
and which can be seen every day,
and from any accessible point of the
earth's surface, gives a far ampler
field for such observations. If we
have instruments so delicate as to
disclose to us the presence in the
sun of iron, copper, zinc, aluminium,
sodium, manganese, magnesium,
calcium, hydrogen, and other
substances, surely it will be possible
to determine that comparatively
gross fact&mdash;its distance from the
earth. And, in truth, what becomes
of the lesson we learned in our
school-days, that the sun was just
ninety-five millions of miles away
from us?
</p>

<p>
And yet, strange as it may seem
to those unacquainted with the
subject, it has been found impossible
to decide, by direct observations,
the actual distance; and the
distance usually accepted was not
derived from such observations.
As for our lately acquired knowledge
of some of the constituent
substances of the sun, that is derived
from the spectroscope, which
as yet throws no light on the question
of distance.
</p>

<p>
How do we ascertain the distance
of bodies from us? Practice
enables us to judge, and judge correctly,
of the distance and size of
things immediately around us almost
without any consciousness of
how we do it. But if we analyze
the process, it will be found that
we do it chiefly by using both eyes
at the same time. They are separated
by an interval of two and a
half to three inches. As we look
at an object near to us, the rays
from each visible point of it must
separate, in order to enter both
eyes. The images thus formed on
the retina of each eye differ sensibly,
and we instinctively take cognizance
of that difference. Speaking
mathematically, the interval is
a base line, at each end of which
a delicate organism takes the angle
<pb n='151'/><anchor id='Pg151'/>
of the object viewed, and our conclusion
is based on our perception
of the difference between them.
Ordinarily, we estimate distances
by the cross-sight thus obtained.
When, however, the body is so far
off that the lines of light from it to
the eyes become so nearly parallel
that the eyes fail to perceive the
minute difference between the representations
formed on the retina,
then we must recur to the results
of past experience, and judge, as
best we may, of the distance from
other data than that given us at the
moment by our eyesight. Thus a
sailor at sea judges of the distance
of a vessel on the horizon from
the faintness with which he sees
her; for he knows that the intervening
atmosphere absorbs some
of the light, so that distant objects
are dim. He judges from the fact
that a vessel of the form and rig
of the one he is looking at is usually
of a given size, and a certain distance
is required to cause the entire
vessel to look so small, and certain
portions, the size of which he is
familiar with, to become indistinguishable.
He is guided, also, by the
amount to which, on account of
the earth's curvatures, the vessel
seems to be sunk below the horizon.
These are data from experience.
It is wonderful with
what accuracy they enable him to
judge. A landsman by the seaman's
side, and without such aid,
could give only the most random
guesses as to the distance of the
vessel.
</p>

<p>
That we really do make this use
of both eyes in judging of the distance
of bodies near us will be evident
if we bandage one eye and try
to determine their distances, only
using the other. It will require
caution to avoid mistakes. We
knew an aged painter, who had lost
the sight of one eye, but still continued
to play, at least, with his
brush. He had to use the finger of
his left hand to ascertain by touch
whether the tip of his brush, loaded
with the proper color, was sufficiently
near the canvas or not. If he
relied on his eye alone, it often
happened that when he thought it
near, not the eighth of an inch
away, it failed in reality by an
inch and a half to reach the canvas.
He would ply the brush, and, noticing
that the color was not delivered,
would smile sadly at what
he called his effort to paint the air.
So long as he had retained the use
of both eyes, this mishap, of course,
had never occurred to him.
</p>

<p>
When a surveyor desires to ascertain
the distance of a visible object
which he cannot approach, he must
avail himself of the same principle
of nature. He measures off on the
ground where he is a suitable baseline,
and takes the angle of the object
from each end of it, not vaguely
by his unaided eyesight alone,
but with a well-graduated instrument.
It is, as it were, putting his
eyes that far apart, and taking the
angles accurately. From the length
of the measured base-line and the
size of the two angles he can easily
calculate the distance of the object.
In taking such measurements, the
surveyor must make his base sufficiently
large in proportion to the
distance sought. If the base be
disproportionately small, the angles
at the extremities will not serve.
Their sum will be so near 180°
that the possible errors which are
ever present in observations will
more than swallow up the difference
left for the third angle, and the distance
is not obtained. In our excellent
Coast Survey, which, in exactness
of working, is not surpassed
anywhere in the world, the bases
<pb n='152'/><anchor id='Pg152'/>
carefully measured may be five or
seven miles long, and angles under
30° are avoided when possible.
</p>

<p>
From such measuring of distant
objects on the surface of the earth,
the passage was easy to an attempt
to measure the distance of heavenly
bodies. How far is the moon from
us? It was soon found that a base
of ten miles or of a hundred miles
was entirely too short to give satisfactory
angles. The moon was too
distant. A far larger base was required.
Suppose two places to be
selected on the same meridian of
longitude, and therefore agreeing in
time, and situated sixty degrees of
latitude apart. The distance between
them will be equal to a radius
of the earth. At each station, and at
the same hours, the angles are taken
which the moon makes with the
zenith, or, better still, with some
star near it, coming to the meridian
at the same time. In such a case,
the angles are, satisfactory. The
base is large enough. The result
of such observations, and of others
which we need not dwell on, is
that, when nearest to us, the centre
of the moon is distant from the
centre of the earth 222,430 miles;
when at her greatest distance, 252,390
miles. These numbers are
based on the fact that the equatorial
radius or semi-diameter of the
earth is 3962.57 miles. This value,
however, may in reality be a quarter
of a mile too short. The mean
distance of the moon is roughly
stated at 60 semi-diameters of the
earth.
</p>

<p>
When observers essayed to apply
to the sun the same procedure which
had proved so successful in regard
to the moon, they encountered disastrous
failures, partly because the
base, even the largest practicable
one, was found to be comparatively
very small; partly because, when
the sun shines, no star is visible
near by from which to measure an
angle; and also because the atmosphere
is so disturbed by the
rays of solar heat that, when seen
through a large telescope, the sun's
edge is quite tremulous. Hence a
very large element of uncertainty is
introduced when angles are taken
with the zenith. No astronomer
would look with confidence on the
result obtained under such circumstances.
Two hundred years ago,
their instruments were much less
perfect than those we now have;
yet, even with our best instruments,
to-day, too much uncertainty remains.
That mode of ascertaining
the sun's distance has been abandoned.
</p>

<p>
Ancient astronomers, long before
the invention of telescopes, and before
the discovery of the Copernican
system, devised an ingenious method
of getting some light on the
distance of the sun. It is attributed
to Aristarchus of Samos. They reflected
that, when the moon appeared
precisely half full, this arose
from the fact that the sun and the
earth were at right angles to her;
the sun illumining the half turned
to him, and the plane of division
between the illumined and unillumined
portions extended stretching
directly to the earth. They conceived
the three bodies to stand at
the angles of a right-angled triangle,
of which the distance of the moon
from the earth was the base, and
the distance of the sun was the hypothenuse.
Hence they had only
to measure the angle at the earth,
which they could do, and then take
into account their estimate of the
moon's distance, to arrive at the
result sought. The plan is ingenious,
and taught them that the sun
was at least twenty times further off
than the moon. But their estimate
<pb n='153'/><anchor id='Pg153'/>
of the moon's distance was altogether
wide of the mark. They
had no means of correctly estimating
it. Moreover, even keen eyesight
is a bad judge of whether the
moon is precisely half full or not.
The error of half a dozen hours
would give a large mistake. Even
with instruments such as we have,
it cannot be precisely determined
by direct observations; for the
surface of the moon, as developed
in a powerful telescope, is so uneven,
jagged, and volcanic that the
division between light and shade is
a line too uneven and broken to be
determined except by guessing at
its mean course.
</p>

<p>
Another method has been also
used in these later centuries. Kepler's
law applies to all the planets.
The planet next outside the earth
is Mars, whose mean distance from
the sun is about one-third greater
than that of the earth. It periodically
happens that Mars is in opposition&mdash;that
is, is precisely on the other
side of the earth from the sun. In
that case, he makes his nearest approach
to our planet. Cannot his
distance from the earth be then observed
and determined, so that he
will give us the means of calculating
by Kepler's formula the distance
of the sun? It was tried, and with
some success. The base-line was
found large enough; the observations
were made at night, when the
atmosphere is comparatively quiescent,
and when fixed stars may be
seen in the vicinity of the planet, to
aid in taking the requisite angles.
Yet, as in the case of Venus, there
are, as we have stated, subsidiary
calculations to be made on account
of the eccentricity of his orbit and
his varying velocity. In the case
of Mars, these variations were too
full of anomalies to allow confidence
in the calculations. When afterwards
these anomalies were understood
to proceed from interplanetary
attraction, they were so complicated
that their numerical value
almost escaped calculation. The
whole subject has been gone over
in our own day under the light of
more perfect observations, and with
the aid of the highest calculus. We
doubt, however, if even now the
results are sufficiently established
to warrant a calculation as to the
sun's distance to which reasonable
exception may not be taken.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, this method cannot compare,
either in facility of calculation
or in accuracy of result, with the
method of determining the solar
distance by observations for the
transit of Venus.
</p>

<p>
Of the theory and mode of such
observations we will now say a few
words.
</p>

<p>
In 1677, while Halley, the great
English astronomer, was at St. Helena,
for the purpose of observing
and cataloguing stars south of the
equator, he observed a transit of
Mercury across the face of the sun,
and, from his efforts to measure its
positions and movements, was led
to believe that a transit of Venus
could be so accurately observed
and measured as to yield a precise
and definite determination of the
sun's distance. From the knowledge
he had of the movements of
Venus, he knew that there had been
a transit of Venus in 1631, as Kepler
had predicted, although no eye
in Europe had seen it; and another
in 1639, which had been observed,
but, of course, not for this purpose,
which in 1639 was yet unthought
of. The next transit would be in
1761. He could not hope to live
to see it. But he did the next best
thing. He studied out all the conditions
of the question, published
his plans, and made all the preliminary
<pb n='154'/><anchor id='Pg154'/>
calculations required, so as to
aid in securing, as far as possible,
good observations and good results
when the time came.
</p>

<p>
As the year 1761 was approaching,
the scientific world was astir,
pretty much as it is now. Halley's
computations were again gone over,
and such corrections and improvements
were introduced as the advance
of astronomy since his day
warranted and required. Governments
gave their aid and supplied
means liberally. One hundred and
twenty positions had been carefully
chosen, and the best results were
confidently expected. The grand
problem was about to receive a
final and definite solution. The
error in the ultimate result would
certainly not exceed one-fifth of one
per cent.
</p>

<p>
The astronomers were doomed to
a sad disappointment. Wars then
waging prevented some of the most
important positions from being occupied
by the observers. It was
bitter for a well-appointed party to
sail for months and months over
two oceans, only to see a hostile
flag floating over the port they were
about to enter. Sadly they sailed
away, and could only see the transit
from the rolling deck of their ship.
Cloudy weather rendered other positions
valueless. And even where
everything seemed to promise success,
an unforeseen phenomenon interfered
to mar their work. The
astronomer might have his best
telescope duly mounted, and directed
to the proper point of the
heavens, and carefully adjusted;
his eye might be glued to the instrument,
as he watched on one side of
his field of vision a portion of the
circular edge of the sun's disk, and
on the other the round, black spot
gradually approaching. As they
drew near, his hand was raised to
give the signal; his assistant stood
ready to mark the very second when
the two edges, coming nearer and
nearer, would at last just touch.
They hoped to seize the time of
that first contact so accurately as to
escape even the one second of error
or doubt which Halley thought
unavoidable. Vain hope! Before
the contact, while Venus was still
distant about two-thirds of her own
diameter from the edge of the sun,
a dark streak or band seemed to
interpose between them like a black
cushion or wedge. As they pressed
against it, the curved outlines of
their edges seemed to be pressed
back or flattened, as if by the resistance
of the cushion, and to lose their
normal shape. There was a pause
in the onward movement, a quivering,
a struggle, and then, by an irregular,
convulsive jump, like that
of two drops of water coalescing
into one, Venus was seen to have
already entered some way on the
disk of the sun. The discomfited
and astonished observer was forced
to record that his uncertainty as to
the precise time of the contact was
not of one second only, but of at
least twelve or fifteen seconds.
Was it the defect of the instrument,
or the fault of his own eye, over-strained
by long use, by the brilliant
light, or by his intense anxiety? Or
was there some unknown atmospheric
cause at work producing this
band? Anyhow, he might hope that
other observers would be more fortunate
than he had been. Again
he was in error. Everywhere the
same unexpected and puzzling phenomenon
appeared. There was
trouble in the astronomical world.
The fault was generally thrown on
the instruments. But whatever the
cause of the mishap, there was some
room for consolation. They would
soon have another opportunity, and
<pb n='155'/><anchor id='Pg155'/>
might make another trial. In 1769,
only eight years off, there would be
another transit, and by that time
some means would certainly be devised
for escaping the evil.
</p>

<p>
In 1769, the stations were as numerous,
the governmental aid fully
as great, the instruments, they said,
more perfect, and the observers, we
may be sure, as earnest and as careful
as before. Perhaps they were
more skilful because of their previous
experience. But again all in
vain. The same evil reappeared.
The resulting uncertainty was even
greater. It was held to reach fully
twenty seconds. When they undertook
to calculate, from such observations,
the distance of the sun,
some made it not more than 87,890,780
miles, while, according to
others, it reached 108,984,560 miles,
the majority finding intermediate
values. On the whole, it did not
appear that there was much improvement
on the estimate made by
Cassini a century and a half before,
that it was not less than 85,000,000
miles. Again and again were the
records of the observations studied,
scrutinized, and weighed, and the
calculations based on them repeated
and criticised. Finally, in 1824,
Encke, after several years of special
study of them, summed all up, and
gave, as the best result attainable,
95,274,000 miles. The scientific
world, hopeless of anything better,
seemed for a time to acquiesce.
Some even upheld the estimate of
Encke as <q>so successfully determined
as to leave no sensible doubt
of its accuracy.</q>
</p>

<p>
But, despite this, its accuracy has
since been impugned, and on very
strong grounds. It was known that
light travels from the sun to the
earth in about 8 minutes 13 seconds.
Experiments carefully and ingeniously
made by Arago, Foucault,
and Fizeau show that light travels
with a velocity of nearly 186,000
miles a second. This would give
the distance of about 91,400,000
miles.
</p>

<p>
The irregularities of the moon
and of Mars have been studied out
and calculated on the theory of
interplanetary attraction modifying
the attraction of the sun. Though
the results vary somewhat, yet they
all tend in the same direction. Leverrier
found 91,759,000 miles;
Hansen, the Dane, found 91,659,000
miles; Airey, the Astronomer-Royal
of England, whose earlier
opinion of Encke's estimate we
quoted above, has changed his opinion,
and now proposes 91,400,000
miles.
</p>

<p>
A fact in practical optics, calculated
to affect some observations
rather seriously, has been discovered
within the last few years. It is
this: When a white body is viewed
on a dark ground, its size is exaggerated
by some illusion of our
vision; and, on the contrary, a dark
body seen on a bright ground appears
smaller than it would were
the ground of a dark color, differing
from that of the body only as
much as is required to render them
distinguishable. Now, in the transit,
a dark body is seen on an intensely
bright ground. It becomes
necessary, therefore, to bring in a
correction which will compensate
for the error arising from this optical
illusion. This has been done
by Stone, who studied out the
whole matter, arrived at certain
modes of correction, applied them
to Encke's calculation, and maintains
that the true result of the
observations of 1761 and 1769
should be 91,730,000 miles.
</p>

<p>
Thus all seem to agree that the
sun's distance must be less than
92,000,000 miles, and that Encke's
<pb n='156'/><anchor id='Pg156'/>
estimate was too great by 3 or 4 per
cent.
</p>

<p>
This is the stage at which our
astronomers now take up the question,
and aim to obtain a yet more
definite and precise result. Will
they succeed? They are full of
confidence now; what they will
say after their observations we
may know a year hence.
</p>

<p>
Some of our readers may like to
know what is the course followed
in making the observations and in
calculating the results. We will
give a slight account of the chief
points, sufficiently detailed to enable
one with an ordinary knowledge
of trigonometry to understand
how the conclusion is reached.
</p>

<p>
The astronomers will follow two
methods, known as those of Halley
and of Delisle. They each require
two suitable stations, so far apart
on the surface of the earth as to
give a satisfactory base-line. In
fact, the further apart, the better,
all things else being equal. For
Halley's method, the two stations
lie as nearly north and south as
may be. For Delisle's, they lie
east and west.
</p>

<p>
Let us suppose two such stations
to be chosen on or nearly on the
same meridian of longitude, and
6,000 miles apart. From each of
these stations the planet is seen to
traverse the disk of the sun, like a
dark spot moving steadily across
an illuminated circular dial-plate.
The lines as seen from stations so
far apart are sensibly different.
What the observers first seek to
know is the apparent distance between
these lines, the angle they
form, when seen from the earth.
Were both visible at once from the
same station, through the same
telescope, it would not be difficult
for a skilful observer to measure
the angle directly. But at each
station only one line is seen, if,
indeed, we may properly give that
name to the course of the dark
spot that passes on and leaves no
trace behind. Each observer must
determine correctly the position of
his line on the face of the sun, in
order that it may be afterwards
compared with the other line similarly
determined at the other, and
the apparent distance between
them is then determined by calculation.
</p>

<p>
How to determine the true position
of such a line is the delicate
and difficult task. One mode is to
take the measurements in two directions
on the face of the sun,
northward and eastward, from the
position of the planet to the edge
of the solar disk. This must be
done for a number of positions
which the planet occupies successively
as it moves onward. But
such measurements are very hard
to be obtained with the desired
precision. The edge of the sun,
viewed in a large telescope, appears
always tremulous, on account of
the action of solar heat on our own
terrestrial atmosphere. The better
and larger the telescope, and the
brighter the day, the greater and
the more embarrassing does this
tremulousness appear. Such measurements
are difficult, and are open
to too much uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
There is another mode, which, if
successfully used, is far more accurate.
The lines or paths which
the planet, viewed from the observatories,
is seen to follow are chords
across a circle&mdash;largest when they
pass through the sun's centre and
become diameters, smaller as their
course is more distant from the
sun's centre. Being both due to
the motion of the same body moving
at what we may hold to be a
uniform velocity, their lengths must
<pb n='157'/><anchor id='Pg157'/>
be proportional to the times required
for tracing them. Being chords,
a knowledge of their relative lengths
determines with accuracy their position
on the circular disk of the sun,
and consequently their distance
apart. Hence the importance of
catching, with the utmost exactness,
the beginning and the ending of
the transit. The first exterior contact
is noted when the circular
edge of Venus just touches the circular
edge of the sun; then the
first interior contact when the entire
little, dark circle of Venus is
just fully on the sun. Midway
between the two, the centre of Venus
was just on the edge of the sun.
Similarly, the second interior contact
and the second exterior contact,
if accurately and successfully
observed, will show the instant of
time when the centre of Venus
passed off from the sun's surface.
It was, as we saw, in making these
delicate observations, that the observers
of 1761 and 1769 failed, to a
great extent, on account of the
mysterious appearance of the black
band, of which we gave an account.
Will this embarrassing phenomenon
again make its appearance next
December? If it be due, as some
think, to an aberration of sphericity
in the lenses of the instruments, it
may not be seen. For our telescopes
are far more perfect than
those of 1769. If it is due, as
others maintain, to an interference
of light in the observation, a more
delicate manipulation of the instrument
may, it is hoped, avoid it. If
it is due to some optical illusion in
our own eye, it will, of course, appear
again, and must be grappled
with. The observers now being
trained at Greenwich, in preparation
for the grand day, have a facsimile
of the sun and Venus, which
are made to move in such manner
as to give as exact a representation
of the transit as is possible; and
they practise observations on this
artificial transit. It is said that
even in this fac-simile the black
band has shown itself, and that one
important lesson now being learned
is how to judge of the instant
of contact, despite of this obstacle.
</p>

<p>
There is, however, a still better
safeguard&mdash;the use of photography.
The transit will record itself more
minutely and more accurately than
any ordinary observations for measurement
could do. Various plans
will be used. One proposed is to
have one hundred and eighty prepared
and highly sensitive plates
along the circumference of a suitable
wheel made to revolve regularly
by clock-work. During three minutes,
these plates come, one every
second, successively into position
to receive and record the images
of the transit, as the planet for those
three minutes is entering on the
sun. Other plates, at stated and accurately
measured intervals of time,
will similarly record its regular progress
across the sun; and another
wheel, with one hundred and eighty
other plates, will record the successive
changes each second for the
three minutes occupied by its exit
over the sun's border. These are
all, of course, negatives on glass.
From them any number of impressions
can be taken, in the usual
way, for general distribution among
the scientists. In order that such
impressions may still serve for the
finest measurements, despite of any
variations of expansion, contraction,
or warping which the atmospheric
changes may produce, a system of
fine, spider-web lines is placed inside
the telescope, producing on
the photograph itself a network of
fine lines, some running north and
south, others crossing them east
<pb n='158'/><anchor id='Pg158'/>
and west. These lines are at equal
distances apart, and serve admirably
for measuring the position of
the planet on the solar face. If
the photographic sheet should become
quite distorted, these lines
would show it; for they would of
course follow the distortion, and
yet, after that distortion, they would
still guide us to accurate measurements.
It is hoped that this means
and the many other photographic
devices to be used will secure a degree
of accuracy far beyond what
Halley anticipated and would have
been satisfied with.
</p>

<p>
The spectroscope comes in also
to aid in determining the contacts
with the utmost precision. The
light of the solar photosphere, or
body of the sun, when made to pass
through the prisms of a spectroscope,
spreads into a continuous
band of various colors, and crossed
by many faint, dark lines. Other
bodies, raised to a certain heat, and
emitting light, give a spectrum of a
totally different character. We see
only bright upright lines. There is
no continuous band or spectrum of
prismatic colors. Now, just outside
the solar photosphere, and between
it and the chromosphere, is a layer
of solar atmosphere which gives just
such upright, bright lines. This
was first discovered not many years
ago during a total solar eclipse, when
the direct light of the photosphere
was cut off by the interposing moon.
Knowing what to look for, the astronomers
have since been able so
to manipulate their telescopes as to
catch these bright lines, even when
there is no eclipse. They find
them, of course, as they examine, a
narrow ring apparently encircling
the sun, and immediately around
his circumference. Now, when the
moment of the beginning of the
transit is at hand, the spectroscope
is turned to the precise point where
Venus will touch the sun's rim, and
these lines are clearly brought into
vision. So long as they shine, the
way is open for the light of that
narrow layer or belt to reach the
earth. The instant their bright
flash disappears, the observer knows
that the planet has so moved as to
intercept the rays of light, and is
just in contact. Their reappearance,
at the proper time, on the
other side of the sun, will indicate
the instant when Venus will have
quitted the disk and the transit is
over.
</p>

<p>
It is confidently expected that by
some one or by all of these methods
the uncertainties of 1761 and 1769
will be avoided, and that the instants
of the commencement and
the conclusion of each line of the
transit may be so accurately determined
that for neither of them will
the error as to their duration exceed
one second. Did the time
occupied by Venus in making the
transit, as seen from one station,
differ from the time as seen at the
other by only one minute, the uncertainty
of one second would be
less than two per cent. But, in
fact, the times will differ by fifteen
minutes, and, by skilfully choosing
the places, a difference of twenty
minutes may be obtained. In that
case, the error or uncertainty would
be less than one-tenth of one per
cent. For the present, the scientific
world will be satisfied with that degree
of exactness.
</p>

<p>
Let us return to our supposition
of two stations north and south,
6,000 miles apart. The two lines
of transit, as seen from them, are
separated about 35 of an arc. This
is as the lines are seen from the
earth. If we recur to Kepler's proportion,
as stated before&mdash;that the
distance of the earth from the sun
<pb n='159'/><anchor id='Pg159'/>
is to the distance of Venus from the
sun as 10,000,000 is to 7,233,324&mdash;we
can make use of a trigonometrical
calculation, and easily ascertain
that those same lines on the sun,
seen by an observer on Venus, would
appear about 48-½" apart. Moreover,
the lines from the sun to Venus,
forming this angle, cross each
other at the planet, and, if prolonged,
will reach the two stations
on the earth. Hence, since opposite
interior angles are equal, this
(48-½") must be the angle at which
the same observer on Venus, turning
towards the earth, would see the
two stations. We arrive thus at a
triangle, in which the base is known&mdash;6,000
miles; the angle at the vertex
on Venus is also known&mdash;48-½"; and
the angles at the base are easily ascertainable.
A simple calculation
leads to the distance of Venus from
the earth&mdash;about 25,300,000 miles.
Again, applying Kepler's formula to
this number, we obtain as the result,
for the earth's distance from the sun,
about 91,450,000 miles. If we give
here only rough approximations, we
are, after all, as near the truth as the
astronomers of to-day can boast of
being. In a minute calculation,
subsidiary but important points are
to be brought in, complicating the
calculation and influencing the result.
</p>

<p>
After this statement of the general
character of Halley's method,
we may be brief in our notice of the
yet more beautiful mode of Delisle.
He proposed it before the transits
of the last century. But its efficiency
so entirely depends on an accurate
knowledge of the longitudes
of the stations, and the longitudes
of distant stations were then so uncertain,
that it could not then be
used with success.
</p>

<p>
In this mode, two stations are
necessary, east and west, or, rather,
along that line on the earth's surface
from all points of which the
transit will show the same line on
the solar disk. The further apart
the stations are, the better; for the
base between them will be larger.
To know the distance between
them, we must know their longitudes
as accurately as their latitudes.
From the longitudes we ascertain
with precision the difference of time
between them. At one of those
stations, the first exterior contact is
seen, and the exact time is noted.
As Venus moves on, the shadow of
this first contact flies along that line
of the earth's surface like the shadow
of a cloud in spring traversing
the fields. It is only after the lapse
of a certain length of time that the
contact is seen and timed at the
other station. This certain length
of time is the key to the solution.
It may be determined by observations
on any one or on all the contacts,
or by the observation of any
other points of the transit examined
and timed at both stations. It is
obvious that the contacts, being the
most unmistakable in their character,
will be all used to check and
control each other; the more so, as
they serve also, as we saw, for Halley's
method. The most careful
use of the telescope will be supplemented
by the photograph and the
spectroscope.
</p>

<p>
Let two such stations be chosen
which, by their longitudes and latitudes,
we know to be 5,000 miles
apart. It will be found that the
transit, or any special point of it,
will be seen at the second station
about three minutes of time later
than at the first. This means that
the shadow of Venus travels 5,000
miles in three minutes on the
earth's surface or at the earth's
distance from the sun. Applying
Kepler's formula, we find that, to
<pb n='160'/><anchor id='Pg160'/>
produce this effect, Venus herself
must have travelled about 3,860
miles in those three minutes. There-fore
in 224.7 days&mdash;her solar year&mdash;she
would travel about 416 millions
of miles, supposing that, during the
transit, she was moving at her mean
velocity. This, then, is the length
of her periphery of her orbit
around the sun. Observations have
determined its shape. Now that
we know its size, it is not difficult
to ascertain what her mean distance
from the sun must be. It is
about 66,300,000 miles. From this,
the usual formula leads us to the
earth's distance from the sun&mdash;91,650,000
miles. We merely indicate
the salient points of the process,
and that with summary numbers.
An astronomer would enter
into minor questions: how far the
earth had travelled in her orbit
during those three minutes, and
what had been the special motion
of the second station during the
same time, on account of the diurnal
revolution of the earth on its
axis. He would carefully establish
the proportion of the distances
between the sun and Venus and
the earth, during the transit, to
their mean distances as contemplated
in Kepler's law, and he
would compare the velocity of
Venus at that time with her mean
velocity. Other points, too, would
have to be brought in, complicating
the whole process to an extent
that would soften the brain of any
one but a calculating astronomer.
</p>

<p>
In Halley's method, the effort is
to obtain two transit lines on the
sun as widely apart as possible.
For that purpose, the stations must
differ in latitude as widely as possible.
In Delisle's method, on the
contrary, the longitude becomes of
primary importance. The latitude
can be easily determined. Hence,
in the last century, Halley's method
was almost exclusively adopted.
But now we can use both; for we
have better instruments and better
star catalogues, and can determine
longitudes by astronomical observations
much more accurately than
could ordinarily be done a century
ago. In addition, we have
now almost faultless chronometers.
Besides all these means, we have,
and will use to a great extent, the
grand American invention of determining
the longitude by the
electric telegraph with an accuracy
which leaves nothing to be desired.
</p>

<p>
While each method requires at
least two stations, a greater number
would support and control
each other, and allow us to take
the average result of a greater number
of observations. Four stations
at the corners of a large quadrangle
on the surface of the earth
might give two sets of stations for
each method. But this year the
stations may be nearer a hundred.
</p>

<p>
Careful preliminary studies have
already determined on what portion
of the earth the transit will be visible.
The most available points
will be turned to account for stations.
We say available; for, unfortunately,
much of that space is
occupied by oceans, while astronomical
stations must perforce be
situated on firm land. Some of the
best points, too, seem almost inaccessible.
Still, there is a vast line
of posts determined on in the
northern hemisphere, and quite a
number, to correspond with them,
in the southern. Beginning at Alexandria,
in Egypt, the line stretches
northward and eastward through
Palestine, Georgia, Tartary, Middle
Asia, and Northern China to Yeddo,
in Japan, perhaps to Honolulu, in
the Sandwich Islands. Along a
great part of this line, the Russian
<pb n='161'/><anchor id='Pg161'/>
telegraphic wires will give exact
longitudes, thus affording a fine
field for the use of Delisle's method.
In the southern hemisphere, the line
may be set down as commencing
near the Cape of Good Hope, bending
southeastwardly to the lately discovered
Antarctic lands, passing
south of Australia, then turning upwards
towards the equator, and terminating
at Nukahiva, in the Sandwich
Islands, in the South Pacific
Ocean. Along this line, at Crozet
Island, at St. Paul's, at Reunion,
at Kerguelen Land&mdash;further south,
if the southern summer will have
sufficiently melted the snows and
driven back the ice-barrier to allow
the observers to land and work&mdash;at
Campbell Land, in New Caledonia,
and in other places, stations
will be established, between which
and corresponding stations in the
northern line Halley's method may
be used.
</p>

<p>
Time, learning, skill, energy,
money, everything that man can
give, will be devoted to ensure success
in the astronomical work to
be done on the 8th of December
next. Such earnestness commands
respect, and wins our sympathy and
best wishes.
</p>

<p>
May the day itself&mdash;the festival
of the Immaculate Virgin Mother&mdash;be
an augury of success! Astronomers,
as a body, are less infected
with the virus of modern scepticism
and materialism than any other
class of our scientists of to-day.
On the contrary, not a few, standing
in the front rank among them, are
devout children of the church.
Some of their chiefs are even numbered
among her clergy. They
will not omit on that day to invoke
the blessing of heaven and the intercession
of their Holy Mother.
May their fervent prayers be heard,
and may He who <q>has ordered all
things in measure and number and
weight</q><note place='foot'>Wisdom xi. 21.</note> bless and give success to
their labors!
</p>

<p>
Yet they can only look for an
approximation to the truth, not
the truth itself. They will see
more clearly than before how the
heavens declare the glory of God.
But there will remain obscurity and
uncertainty enough to teach them
humility in his presence. For
<q>God hath made all things good in
their time, and hath delivered the
world to the consideration of the
sons of men, so that man cannot
find out the work which God hath
made, from the beginning to the
end.</q> This was true when the inspired
Ecclesiastes wrote, and is
still, and must ever be, true. The
history of the progress of physical
sciences is practical, tangible evidence
of it. Each generation has
to correct the mistakes and discard
the errors of a preceding generation,
and must acknowledge the
uncertainty of much that it continues
to hold or boasts of having
discovered.
</p>

<p>
No greater absurdity is conceivable
than that of a man puffed up
with pride because of the little
knowledge he has gained&mdash;little indeed,
though he may think it a
great deal&mdash;who sets his intellect
against the infinite wisdom and the
revelation of God. The more man
really knows, the more conscious
he becomes of his own failures in
many things, and of the vast extent
of his ignorance.

<p>
It was at Messina, July 15, 18&mdash;.
I have never forgotten the date.
It was just after my fifteenth birthday.
The balcony of the room
where I was sitting overlooked the
sea. From time to time, but more
and more faintly, could be heard
the noise of the waves breaking
against the shore. It was the hour
called in Italy the <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>contr' ora</foreign>&mdash;the
hour when, in summer, the whole
horizon is aflame with the scorching
rays of the already declining sun,
which are no longer tempered by
the gentle wind from the sea that
every morning refreshes the shore.
The windows, that had been open
during the earlier part of the day,
were now shut, the blinds lowered,
and the shutters half closed. Profound
silence reigned within doors
and without. For many, this is the
hour of a siesta; and for all, a time
of inaction and repose.
</p>

<p>
I was holding a book in my hand,
not from inclination or pleasure,
but simply through obedience, because
I had a lesson to learn. But
that was no task. I took no pleasure
in studying, nor was it repugnant
to me, for I learned without
any difficulty. The chief benefit
of study was therefore lost on me.
It required no effort.
</p>

<p>
I had not yet even taken the
trouble to open my book, for I saw
by the clock I had ample time.
At six I always went into the garden,
which I was not allowed to
enter during the heat of the day.
There was still an hour before me,
and I knew that a quarter of that
time would be sufficient to accomplish
my task. I therefore remained
indolently seated on a low chair
against the wall, near the half-open
shutter, motionless and dreaming,
my eyes wandering vaguely through
the obscurity that surrounded me.
</p>

<p>
The room I occupied was a large
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salon</foreign>. The ceiling covered with
frescos, and the stuccoed walls
brilliantly ornamented with flowers
and arabesques, prevented this vast
apartment from seeming gloomy or
ill-furnished. And yet, according
to the tastes I have since acquired,
it was absolutely wanting in everything
signified by the word <q>comfort,</q>
which, though now fully understood
in our country, has nevertheless
no corresponding term in
our language. A clumsy gilt <foreign rend='italic'>console</foreign>,
on which stood a ponderous
clock, with an immense looking-glass
above, occupied the further
end of the room; and in the middle
stood a large, round, scagliola table
under a magnificent chandelier of
Venetian glass. This chandelier,
as well as the mirrors that hung
around, not for use, but to ornament
the walls with their handsome
gilt frames and the figures painted
on their surface, were the richest
<pb n='163'/><anchor id='Pg163'/>
and most admired objects in the
room. A few arm-chairs systematically
arranged, a long sofa that
entirely filled one of the recesses,
and here and there some light
chairs, were usually the only furniture
of this vast apartment; but that
day a small couch stood near the
window, and on it reclined my mother&mdash;my
charming young mother!&mdash;her
head resting on a pillow, and
her eyes closed. On her knee lay
a small book, open at a scarcely
touched page, which, with the ink-stand
on a little table before her,
and the pen fallen at her feet, showed
she had been overpowered by
sleep or fatigue while she was writing.
</p>

<p>
My mother at that time was barely
thirty-two years of age. People
said we looked like sisters, and
there was no exaggeration in this.
I was already taller than she, and
those who saw me for the first time
thought me two years older than I
really was; whereas my mother,
owing to the delicacy of her features
and the transparency of her
complexion, retained all the freshness
of twenty years of age. I
looked at her. Her beautiful hair,
parted on her pale brow, fell on the
pillow like a frame around her face,
which looked more lovely than
ever to me. There was a deeper
flush than usual on her cheeks, and
her half-open lips were as red as
coral.... I smilingly gazed at her
with admiration and love! Alas!
I was too much of a child to realize
that this beauty was ominous, and
that I had much more reason to
weep!...
</p>

<p>
My mother was left an orphan
at fifteen years of age without any
protector, and poverty would have
been added to her other privations
had not Fabrizio dei Monti, a
friend of her father's, and a celebrated
lawyer, succeeded in snatching
the young heiress' property
from the hands of a grasping relative
who had been contending for
it. This law-suit had been going
on several years, and the result
was still doubtful when Count
Morani, Bianca's father, died.
</p>

<p>
He who rendered the young
orphan so signal a service was
then about thirty-five years old.
He was a widower, and the father
of two children, to whom he devoted
all the time left him by his
numerous clients, whom his reputation
for ability brought from
all parts of Sicily&mdash;famed, as every
one knows, for the most complicated
and interminable law-suits.
Fabrizio, after his wife's death,
had given up all intercourse with
society, except what was imposed
on him by the obligations of his
profession. With this exception,
his life was spent in absolute retirement
with an austerity as rare
among his fellow-citizens as his
long fidelity to the memory of the
wife he had lost.
</p>

<p>
But when, after advocating Bianca's
cause, he found himself to
be her only protector, he at once
felt the difficulty and danger of
such a situation, and resolved to
place her, without any delay, under
the guardianship of a husband
of her own choice. He therefore
ran over the names of the many
aspirants to the hand of the young
heiress, and gave her a list of those
he thought the most worthy of
her.
</p>

<p>
<q>You have forgotten one,</q> said
Bianca in a low tone, after glancing
over it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Whom?</q> ... inquired Fabrizio
in an agitated tone, not daring to
interpret the glance that accompanied
her words.
</p>

<p>
Bianca still retained all the simplicity
<pb n='164'/><anchor id='Pg164'/>
of a child, and the timidity
of womanhood had not yet come
over her. Accordingly, she said,
as she looked directly towards
him, that she should never feel
for any one else the affection she
had for him; and if he would not
have her, she would go into a convent,
and never be married.
</p>

<p>
It was thus my mother became
Fabrizio dei Monti's wife, and, in
spite of the difference of their ages,
there never was a nobler, sweeter
union. A happier couple could
not have been found in the world
during the fourteen years that followed
my birth. But for several
months past, my father had appeared
depressed and anxious. Sometimes
I could see his eyes blinded
by tears as he looked at my mother,
but the cause I did not understand.
It is true, she often complained
of fatigue, and remained
in bed for hours, which became
more and more prolonged. And
now and then she passed the
whole day there. But when she
was up, as she had been that day,
she did not look ill. On the contrary,
I never saw her look more
beautiful than while I was thus
gazing at her with admiration and
a love amounting to idolatry....
</p>

<p>
After remaining for some time
in the same attitude, I at length
took my book, and endeavored to
give my whole attention to my lesson.
But the heat was stifling,
and, after a few moments, I was, in
my turn, overpowered by an irresistible
drowsiness, to which I insensibly
yielded without changing
my position, and soon sank into a
profound slumber.
</p>

<p>
I had been asleep some time,
when I was suddenly awakened
by a remote, indistinct sound that
seemed like the continuation of
the dream it had interrupted. This
sound was the footsteps of a
horse....
</p>

<p>
I sprang up without taking time
for a moment's reflection. I raised
the blinds, hurriedly opened the
shutters and the window, and
sprang out on the balcony.... The
room was at once flooded with
light and filled with the evening
air. The sun had just disappeared,
and a fresh breeze fanned my
cheeks.... I heard my mother
cough feebly, but did not turn back.
I was overpowered by one thought,
which made me forget everything
else&mdash;everything!&mdash;even <emph>her</emph>!...
I leaned forward to see if I
was mistaken. No, it was really
<emph>he</emph>!... I saw him appear at the
end of the road that connected our
house with the shore. He rode
slowly along on his beautiful horse,
which he managed with incomparable
grace. As he came nearer,
he slackened his pace still more,
and, when beneath the balcony,
stopped, and, taking off his hat,
bowed profoundly, the wind meanwhile
blowing about the curls of
his jet-black hair. Then he raised
his eyes, of the color and tempered
clearness of agate, and with a beseeching,
passionate look seemed
to implore me for some favor.... I
knew what he meant.... Foolish
child that I was! I snatched from
my hair the carnation I had placed
there an hour before, and threw it
towards him!...
</p>

<p>
At that instant I heard a piercing
cry&mdash;a cry that still rings in
my heart, and the memory of
which will never be effaced&mdash;<q>Ginevra!</q>....
Hurrying in, I found
my mother standing in the floor,
pale and gasping for breath, with
her arms extended towards me....
I instantly realized I had been
guilty of an indiscretion which had
afflicted and displeased her. I
<pb n='165'/><anchor id='Pg165'/>
was at once filled with sorrow, and
on the point of throwing myself at
her feet to beg her forgiveness;
but before I had time to speak,
or even reach her, she fell back
on her couch in a semi-unconscious
state that I should have
thought a swoon, had not a spasmodic
groan from time to time escaped
from her breast, and when I
did prostrate myself, had she not
seized one of my hands, which she
continued to hold with a strong
grasp in hers....
</p>

<p>
We remained thus for some minutes
without my being able to
leave her to call for assistance,
though the frightful change in her
face filled me with inexpressible
terror as well as the keenest anguish.
I withdrew my hand at last,
and threw my arms around her
neck, exclaiming repeatedly amid
my sobs: <q>Forgive me! Answer
me! Oh! tell me that you forgive
me!...</q> She made no reply, however,
but by degrees she returned
to herself and grew calm. Then,
taking me in her arms, she held me
a long time closely embraced, as if
she felt there was no safety for me
anywhere else, and longed in some
way for the power of taking me
once more into her maternal breast,
that I might live with her life, or die
if she died!...
</p>

<p>
O Almighty God! the prayer that
then rose from her heart in behalf
of her poor child thou alone didst
hear! But when I recall all the
errors of my past life and thy wonderful
mercy towards me, I feel it
was in answer to that prayer thou
hast bestowed on me so many benefits!
I know that at that instant a
new source of grace was opened to
me never to be exhausted&mdash;a look
of mercy vouchsafed that nothing
has ever extinguished!...
</p>

<p>
My mother still remained speechless,
but her respiration became
more and more regular, though,
alas! still too rapid, and her features
resumed their usual appearance.
But her bright color had
given place to a deadly paleness,
and a large dark ring encircled her
sweet, expressive eyes, now fastened
on me with a look I had never
read there before. She bent down
and kissed me, and I felt two great
tears fall on my forehead, as her
pale lips murmured these words:
</p>

<p>
<q>O my God! since it is thy will
I should die and leave her behind
me, I commit her to thy care.
Watch over her, I pray thee, better
than I have done.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Die!</q> ... my mother die!...
I sprang up with a sudden,
violent bound, as if smitten to the
heart, and stood motionless like
one petrified. A frightful vision
appeared before me!... a vision I
had not been prepared for by the
slightest apprehension, or anxiety,
or suspicion. Notwithstanding the
too precocious development of my
sensibilities, there was something
child-like in my peculiar temperament
that had blinded my eyes, now
so suddenly opened! I tried to recall
the words I had just heard, but
my mind grew confused, and was
conscious of nothing but a sharp
pang I had never yet experienced,
but the cause of which had faded
from my remembrance. I turned
away, perhaps with the vague
thought of calling assistance, perhaps
to close the window, but staggered,
as if dizzy, and fell to the
ground behind the curtain of the
window.
</p>

<p>
At that instant the door opened.
I heard the mingled voices of my
father and several other persons.
Some one sprang forward, exclaiming:
<q>The window open at this
late hour!... Who could have
<pb n='166'/><anchor id='Pg166'/>
been so imprudent?</q> Then I was
conscious that they were gathering
around my mother. My father
took her up in his arms, and carried
her out of the room.... No one
had perceived me in the increasing
obscurity, as I lay on the floor, half
concealed by the curtain. I had
not fainted, but I was in a partially
insensible state, incapable of any
clear notions except the wish to
lose all consciousness of suffering
in a sleep from which I should
never awake!...
</p>

<index index='toc'/>

<head>II.</head>

<p>
I know not how long I remained
in this condition. When I opened
my eyes, the moon was shining so
brightly that the room was as light
as day. I rose up, and threw a terrified
glance around. Everything
in the moonlight wore an ominous
aspect, and I shuddered as my eyes
fell on the couch and the white pillow
on which I had seen my mother's
face resting. What had happened?...
A long time seemed to
have elapsed, and I felt as if on the
edge of an abyss&mdash;an abyss of sorrow
into which I was about to be
precipitated. O my God! was it
a mere dream, or was it a frightful
reality? I could not tell. I soon
became conscious of an excruciating
pain in my head, and my teeth began
to chatter with a violent chill. I rose
up to go out, but it was only with
the greatest difficulty that I reached
my mother's couch, on which I
threw myself in despair, burying
my face in the pillow where she
had reposed her dear head. I
burst into sobs, and this explosion
of grief afforded me momentary
relief.
</p>

<p>
I then attempted to leave the
room, and was proceeding towards
the door, when my attention was attracted
to something that had fallen
on the floor. It was my mother's
little book, the silver clasp of
which glittered in the light of the
moon. I picked it up, and had just
concealed it, when the door opened,
and my sister Livia (my father's
<pb n='167'/><anchor id='Pg167'/>
oldest daughter) appeared with a
light in her hand.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gina!</q> she exclaimed, <q>how
you frightened me! What are you
doing here, child, at this late hour?
I thought you were in the garden.
How long have you been here?</q>
</p>

<p>
I made no reply. I felt as if I
should die of mortification, should
any one learn what had taken place
before my mother's ill turn; but
Livia did not repeat her question.
She was pale and preoccupied, and
her eyes were red with weeping.
</p>

<p>
What could have happened? My
heart throbbed with suspense, but I
had not courage enough to ask a
single question. She had come for
the pillow left on the couch, and
seemed to be hunting for something
she could not find. Perhaps it was
my mother's note-book, which at
night she always laid on a table
beside her bed. But I did not give
it to her. I wished to restore it
myself, and, though generally frank
with Livia, said nothing about finding
it. Agitated as I was, I felt
that this little book was a treasure
that belonged solely to me&mdash;a treasure
of which I must never allow
any one to deprive me. She made
me hold a light to aid her in her
vain search, but, not finding it, she
took the rest of the things on the
stand, and left the room. I followed
her, and we walked along together
through the gallery that led
to my mother's chamber, which was
at the end.
</p>

<p>
This gallery, or, rather, open
<foreign rend='italic'>loggia</foreign>, looked down on the inner
court of the old palace we lived in,
and extended entirely around it.
The landing of the principal staircase
to the first story connected
with the gallery, was precisely opposite
the place where we were,
when, all at once, we heard in that
direction a sound&mdash;confused at first,
and then more distinct&mdash;of chanting
and the measured steps of several
people, mingled with the constant
ringing of a bell. Presently
a bright light shone through all that
side of the gallery, and through the
arches we saw a long procession
appear, and proceed around towards
the door directly before us, ... the
door of my mother's chamber....
Livia knelt down, and made a sign
for me to do the same, but I remained
standing, my eyes staring wide
open before me in a kind of stupor.
I saw the long file of white penitents
as they came with lighted
torches in their hands; then appeared
the canopy under which
walked Don Placido, my mother's
aged confessor, carrying the Divine
Host in a silver Ciborium.... I
could see his long, white beard, his
bowed head, his sad, recollected
look, and that was all. In an instant
the truth flashed across my
mind; then everything vanished.
</p>

<p>
This new shock followed the other
so quickly that it caused a deeper
and more dangerous swoon; and
when I was taken up senseless, and
carried to my chamber, it was with
the fear that this fatal night would
be the last for the daughter as well
as the mother....
</p>

<p>
I have no recollection of what
took place for a long while after. I
only remember that, opening my
eyes one day, I saw Ottavia (my
mother's nurse, who had brought
me up) beside my bed. I recognized
<pb n='168'/><anchor id='Pg168'/>
her, and stammered a few
words.... She murmured: <q>Blessed
be God!</q> but did not add another
word. A thousand thoughts
rushed across my mind, but I could
not analyze them, and the one which
might seem of the least importance
was that which I gave utterance to
first.
</p>

<p>
<q>My mother's book,</q> ... I said
repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
Ottavia, without speaking, at
once raised the lid of a large ebony
coffer that stood on the table
not far from my bed, and took out
the little book with the silver clasp.
She held it up, and then replaced
it in the box, which she locked.
Turning to me, she put her finger
on her lips. I obeyed the sign, and
remained silent, but I slept no more
till evening. By degrees my mind
grew clear, and my confused recollections
distinct. The fever that
had brought me so near to death's
door now abated, and from that
day my convalescence was rapid.
But the chief thing that renewed
life and strength restored, was the
faculty of suffering, and comprehending
in all its fulness the reality
of my misfortune.
</p>

<p>
My mother was no more. She
did not live to see the morrow of
the day when she embraced me for
the last time. My father's agitated
face revealed this terrible fact more
clearly even than the mourning he
wore.... But I did not learn the
details of her last hours till a long
time after the day when, for the
second time, he lost the light of
his fireside. Knowing the keen impetuosity
of my disposition, a violent
explosion of grief had been
anticipated. But it was not so.
On the contrary, I fell into a state
of gloomy silence that gave rise to
fresh anxiety to those who had so
long trembled for my life.
</p>

<p>
The physician, however, advised
my father, my sister Livia, and
Ottavia, who took turns at my
bedside, to leave everything to time
without attempting to oppose me.
I therefore passed day after day
without appearing to notice their
presence. But on other days, I silently
made some sign of gratitude,
which would bring a smile to my
father's pale face. Then Livia
would embrace me, saying: <q>Courage,
<foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>bambina</foreign>!<note place='foot'>Little girl.</note> Try to love God's
holy will.</q> Or Ottavia, as she
used to do when I was only four
years old, would hold up the silver
cross on her cornelian rosary, which
I always looked at with pleasure.
And when they saw me kiss it for
the first time, they began to hope,
in spite of my silence, for the return
of my reason. But my eyes would
become fixed again, and I would
cease to recognize any one. And
when my pillow was found wet with
my tears, as was often the case, the
physician would say: <q>That is a
good sign; let her weep. It is a
relief she needs.</q> But days passed,
and my mental condition remained
the same.
</p>

<p>
My strength nevertheless returned.
I was able to get up, and several
times I walked a few steps on
the terrace leading from my chamber
without any injury. But nothing
could break the unnatural
silence that transformed into an inanimate
statue the girl whose excessive
vivacity and unrestrained
liveliness had sometimes disturbed,
sometimes enlivened, the whole
house, filling it throughout with
the sense of her presence.
</p>

<p>
One day I was sitting on my terrace,
looking off over the gulf, when
Ottavia approached, and, as usual,
began to talk with the vain hope of
<pb n='169'/><anchor id='Pg169'/>
drawing forth some reply. I generally
listened in silence, but that
day a new train of thought came
into my mind, which I felt the
power of pursuing clearly, calmly,
and with a certain persistence that
proved my physical strength was
at last beginning to triumph over
the kind of mental paralysis which
made my convalescence seem like a
new phase of my disease.
</p>

<p>
Ottavia had placed a number of
books on a small table beside me.
She knew nothing of them but the
covers, but she offered them to me
one by one, hoping to induce me to
read&mdash;a diversion it was desirable
I should take to. At last I shook
my head, and for the first time
pushed away the book she offered
me. Then I spoke, and the sound
of my voice was a joyful surprise to
my faithful attendant:
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Ottavia, not that one. I
want another book, and that alone&mdash;the
one you put away there,</q>
with a gesture and glance towards
the further end of my chamber.
</p>

<p>
Ottavia understood me, but hesitated
between the joyful hope of
my cure awakened by my reply,
and the fear of causing fresh excitement
which might bring on another
relapse. But after all the
means that had been used to rouse
me from the state of apathy into
which I had fallen, it did not seem
prudent to oppose that which I
had chosen myself. She therefore
obeyed my request, and, without
any reply, opened the ebony coffer
where she had put my mother's
book, as if it were a relic, and placed
it in my hands.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you, Ottavia,</q> I said.
And putting my arms around her
neck, I kissed her, causing big tears
of joy to roll down her cheeks.
<q>And now leave me, I beg of you;
leave me alone for an hour.</q>
</p>

<p>
She hesitated a moment, and
looked at me uneasily, but then
complied as before with my wish,
and, after seeing that I was sheltered
from the sun and wind, noiselessly
left the balcony through my room.
</p>

<p>
I then kissed the cover of the
book I held in my hand, and
opened it with awe. It seemed
to me I was about to hear my
mother's voice from the depths of
the tomb!

<p>
&mdash;&mdash;Ginevra! It is to her I consecrate
these pages&mdash;the child that
at once fills my heart with inexpressible
anxiety and the tenderest
affection&mdash;the child whom I love so
dearly, but whom my hands perhaps
are too feeble to guide. And yet I
shudder at the thought of leaving her
behind me. My strength, however,
is rapidly failing, and I feel that my
poor child will soon be left alone.
</p>

<p>
Alone! This word may seem
harsh to you, Fabrizio mio, and, lest
this should meet your eye, I will
explain my meaning.
</p>

<p>
I know you have as tender a
heart as mine, and your prudence
is far greater; but, to tell you the
truth, you likewise are too fond of
her! You know how many times
I have taken her from your arms to
make room for poor Livia, so often
grieved by your involuntary forgetfulness,
but not offended with her
little sister, because she too, like
every one else, felt that Ginevra
from her infancy had the power
of charming every eye and heart
around her!...
</p>

<p>
But though to Livia you were
sometimes indifferent, you were
never severe, whereas, though generally
too indulgent to Ginevra,
when you detected some fault in
her, I have often seen you inclined
to go from one extreme to another,
and been obliged to beg you to
leave the correction to time or to
her mother.
</p>

<p>
She has grown up, as she is, in
our midst, like one of the flowers
of our clime which put forth their
beauty almost without cultivation,
rejoicing our hearts and our eyes,
and intoxicating us all with the perfume
of her grace and caressing
affection.
</p>

<p>
O yes! it is nothing but intoxication,
and I have perhaps yielded
to it with too much delight; but I
repeat it, it is I alone, among all
who have loved her, whose delight
has been unmingled with blindness.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps this was because (pardon
me, Fabrizio) I loved her
more than any one else, and because
the affection of a mother has
something divine in its clearness of
vision. I see this charming child,
to whom I have given birth, as she
is. I understand her real nature.
I look into her pure soul as into
the limpid waters of some beautiful
lake. But clouds are now passing
over its surface. Others are rising
and gathering, and I tremble to
think a storm may some day rise
up to overwhelm and crush her!
</p>

<lg>
<l><hi rend='smallcaps'>June 1.</hi></l>
</lg>

<p>
This is Ginevra's fifteenth birthday.
I will describe her, not only
as she appears to me, but to every
one else.
</p>

<p>
She is slender and graceful in
form, and an inch or two taller
than I. There is an habitual
sweetness and languor in her large,
brown eyes; but when they are
suddenly lit up with surprise, wonder,
or any other unexpected emotion,
they glow with wonderful expression
<pb n='170'/><anchor id='Pg170'/>
and brilliancy. Her hair,
of a golden hue which is as beautiful
as it is rare in our country,
parts on a pure white brow which
forms almost a continued straight
line with a nose of perfect regularity,
so that her profile would be
quite faultless were not her mouth
larger than is consistent with the
standard of classical beauty. But
this blemish is redeemed by the
expression of her mouth, sometimes
grave and thoughtful enough to
excite anxiety, sometimes half open
with a child-like smile, and often
extended with hearty laughter, like
that of a peasant, displaying two
beautiful rows of small, white
teeth.
</p>

<p>
And now, O my child! I would
with the same sincerity describe
the lineaments of your soul, which
is far dearer to me than your
face&mdash;yes, dearer to me than my
own life, or even than yours!
</p>

<p>
In the inner recesses of this
soul&mdash;and I thank God for it!&mdash;is
hidden, even from her, a jewel of
purity and truth which it would
be far easier to crush than deface.
Then, like a strong wind that cannot
shake this foundation, but
seeks entrance through every pore,
beats a loving nature that cannot
be denied its food, which is the
predominant trait in her character.
Passing over her other good qualities
and her defects, and speaking
merely of her outward appearance,
it must be confessed that she manifests
the excessive vanity of a child,
and a want of reflection that would
be surprising in a girl of ten years
old, mingled with a passionate ardor
that would excite anxiety in
one of twenty!
</p>

<p>
Such is my poor child&mdash;such
are the attractive but alarming
traits that constitute the peculiar
nature she has inherited.
</p>

<p>
O Almighty God! ... two more
years of life, ... that I may
watch over her till the day I
am able to entrust her to the care
of some one she can regard with
the true devotion of a wife!
</p>

<p>
Alas! this desire is consuming
my life. It is shortening my days.
It is hastening my end, which I
regard with calmness when I merely
consider myself, but which fills
me with terror when I think only
of her.
</p>

<lg>
<l><hi rend='smallcaps'>June 15.</hi></l>
</lg>

<p>
It was your wish, Fabrizio, and
I yielded to it. But it was not
without repugnance I saw her go
to this ball. You say your sister
will watch over her; but I know
Donna Clelia better than you.
She has no eyes but for her own
daughters, and will think she has
done her duty to Ginevra by seeing,
when she arrives, that her dress
has not been crumpled on the way,
and, at her return, that she has lost
none of her ribbons. She will separate
her from her own daughters,
you may be sure, lest she eclipse
them, and leave her alone&mdash;alone
in the gay world where she appears
for the first time.... You
smiled when you saw her ready to
start. You whispered with pride
that a lovelier creature never was
seen.... Ah! Fabrizio, at that moment
how I wished she were less
charming, or, at least, that her
beauty could be hidden from every
eye!...
</p>

<p>
Do you remember the assertion
of a queen of France about which
we were conversing only a few
days since? You thought it too
severe, but to me it only seems
reasonable; for it gives expression
to the most earnest wish of my
heart. O yes! like her, I would
rather see the child I love so
passionately&mdash;a thousand times
<pb n='171'/><anchor id='Pg171'/>
rather&mdash;see her die than contract
the slightest stain!...
</p>

<p>
The hours are passing away, and
I must seek calmness in prayer. I
feel as if in this way I shall still be
able to protect her....
</p>

<p>
Clelia promised to bring her
home at eleven. The clock has
just struck twelve, and she has not
yet arrived....
</p>

<lg>
<l><hi rend='smallcaps'>June 25.</hi></l>
</lg>

<p>
I have been ill for a few days
past, and unable to write. To-day
I feel somewhat better, and, though
my mind has been greatly disturbed,
will try to collect my thoughts.
</p>

<p>
I was not deceived in my presentiment.
I thought the day of the
ball would be a fatal one, and I was
not mistaken. As I said, at midnight
she had not returned. I
awaited her arrival with increased
anxiety of mind, lying awake a
whole hour after that, listening to
every sound, and repeatedly mistaking
the noise of the sea for that
of the carriage bringing her home....
At last, about half-past one, I
heard the rumbling of the wheels, and
presently recognized her light step
in the gallery. She passed my door
without stopping, and had arrived
at her own chamber, when Ottavia,
who had been sitting up with me,
went after her to say I was not yet
asleep, if she wished to come and
bid me good-night. As she entered
the door, the light in Ottavia's
hand shone across her face. It
was by no means the same as at
her departure. The excitement of
dancing, and the fatigue of remaining
up to so unusual an hour, were
doubtless sufficient to account for
her disordered hair, her pale face,
and the striking brilliancy of her
eyes; but her troubled look, her
trembling lips, and the care she
took to avoid looking me in the face
when she fell on my neck, showed
there was something more which I
must wait till another day to question
her about....
</p>

<lg>
<l><hi rend='smallcaps'>July 1.</hi></l>
</lg>

<p>
To continue the account interrupted
the other day:
</p>

<p>
I know everything now, for she
never deceives me. She is always
as sincere as she is affectionate.
Yes, she had scarcely entered the
ball-room before she was, as I foretold,
separated from her cousins,
and left in a group of young ladies,
who, treating her as a mere child,
immediately proposed she should
take a seat at a table where there
were sweetmeats and games. Just
then the orchestra began a dance,
and the two oldest of the group
stationed themselves in front to attract
the attention of those in search
of partners, while a third kept
Ginevra in her seat by showing her
pictures, and patronizingly promising
in a whisper to dance with her
presently. But at the sound of the
music, Ginevra could not be restrained
from springing up and advancing
to look at the preparations
for the dance. This change of
position attracted the observation
of a young gentleman who was
slowly entering the room with an
absent air without appearing to wish
to take any part in the dance.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is Flavio Aldini,</q> said
one of the young ladies; <q>he will
not condescend to come this way.
He looks upon us as mere school-girls,
and only dances with those
ladies whose elegance has already
made them the fashion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I never saw him before, but he
looks very much as I supposed from
the description I had of him. Is
he not said to be engaged to a rich
heiress?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He? No; he does not dream of
marrying, I assure you. I tell you
he never looks at us young ladies.</q>
</p>

<pb n='172'/><anchor id='Pg172'/>

<p>
<q>And yet, my dear, he seems to
be looking rather earnestly in this
direction now.</q>
</p>

<p>
She was right. At that very
moment, the person of whom they
were speaking eagerly approached
the place where Ginevra was standing,
and, without glancing at her
companions, accosted her, begging
she would give him the pleasure of
being her partner in the quadrille
about to begin.
</p>

<p>
This was a triumph for my poor
Ginevra, and all the greater after
the vexation caused by her companions'
patronizing airs. She went
away radiant&mdash;intoxicated....
Hitherto she had been petted as a
child; now she suddenly realized
how much admiration a woman can
inspire, and this knowledge, like a
mischievous spark, fell from the
look and smile of Flavio Aldini into
her very heart!
</p>

<p>
Flavio Aldini! You will understand,
Fabrizio, the terror I felt at
the mere name of this presuming
fellow; so well calculated, alas! to
please young eyes like hers, and
capable of taking advantage of the
impression he could not help seeing
he had made on her inexperience....
</p>

<p>
How agitated the poor child
was in repeating all his dangerous
compliments! And how flattering
to her pride a success that attracted
the attention of every one in
the room, and made her an object
of envy to those who had just
humiliated her by their condescension!...
I allowed her to go
on.... I was glad, at all events, to
see she did not manifest the least
shade of deception&mdash;the usual consequence
of vanity&mdash;but I trembled
as I listened!
</p>

<p>
He begged for the little bunch
of flowers she wore in her bosom.
She was strongly tempted to grant
his request, and was only prevented
from doing so by the fear of
being observed.
</p>

<lg>
<l><hi rend='smallcaps'>July 5.</hi></l>
</lg>

<p>
I have not been able to continue.
I have been growing weaker
and weaker, and can only write
a few lines at a time without fatigue.
Since the 15th of June, I have been
constantly worried and anxious. I
cannot bear for her to leave me
now for a single instant. I want
to keep her constantly under my
eyes and near my heart. Yesterday
I saw her start at the sound
of a horse passing under the balcony.
To-day she was standing
there with her eyes dreamily turned
towards the road that connects
our house with the shore.... I
called her, and she listened as I
talked kindly to her, hoping to
give a new turn to her thoughts,
instead of trying to check them by
remonstrances. She is easily influenced
and guided by kindness
but it is difficult to make her yield
to authority. Oh! there never was
a child who needed more than she
the tender guidance of a mother!...
</p>

<p>
But let thy will, O God! be
done. Help me to say this without
a murmur. Let me not forget
that my love for her is nothing&mdash;nothing
at all&mdash;in comparison with
that.
</p>

<lg>
<l><hi rend='smallcaps'>July 15.</hi></l>
</lg>

<p>
It is only with great effort I can
write to-day. I do not know as
I shall be able to write more than
a few lines. But I wish to remind
you once more, Fabrizio, of the conversation
we had yesterday evening.
Who knows but it was the
last we shall ever have in this
world! My time here is short.
Do not forget my request. Lose
no time in uniting her to some one
she can love and will consent to
<pb n='173'/><anchor id='Pg173'/>
be guided by. Though still young,
he should be several years older
than she, in order to inspire her
with respect, which is so sweet
when mingled with affection, as
no one knows better than I, Fabrizio.
Has not the mingled respect
and love with which you have filled
my heart constituted the happiness
of my life? I would bless
you once more for this, as I close.
I have not strength enough to continue....
I must stop.... And
yet I would speak once more of
her&mdash;of my Ginevra&mdash;my darling
child. I would implore you to be
always mild and patient with her,
and if ever....
</p>

<milestone unit='tb'/>

<p>
Here the journal ended!...
Oh! what a torrent of recollections
rushed across my mind at the sight
of this unfinished page! This little
book falling from her hand, ...
her slumbers, ... her terrible
awakening, ... her incoherent
words, her last embrace, my despair!
All this I recalled with poignant
grief as I pressed my lips to the
lines written by her dying hand.
I shed a torrent of tears, but this
time they were salutary tears. I
had already severely expiated my
error, for it was only my deep sorrow
for having embittered the last
hours of my mother's life, and perhaps,
O fearful thought! of hastening
her end, that had given so dark
a shade to my grief, and filled me
with a despair akin to madness. I
was now stronger, calmer, and
wiser, and felt I could yet repair
my fault by fulfilling my mother's
wishes, and this thought brought
the first ray of comfort that penetrated
my heart. I made many new
resolutions in my mind, and felt I
had firmness enough to keep them.

<head>The Principles Of Real Being. V. Intrinsic Principles Of Complex Beings.</head>

<p>
The primitive beings of which
we have treated in a preceding article
imply nothing in their constitution
but what is strictly necessary in
order to exist in nature; and therefore
they are physically simple&mdash;that
is, not made up of other physical
beings, though they are metaphysically
compounded, because
their intrinsic principles are so
many metaphysical components.
Those beings, on the contrary, the
entity of which is not strictly one,
besides the three principles common
to all primitive beings, involve in
their constitution other components,
either physical or metaphysical.
Such <emph>complex</emph> beings are either <emph>substantial</emph>
or <emph>accidental</emph> compounds.
We propose to investigate in the
present article the general constitution
of substantial compounds,
then of accidental compounds; and
lastly we shall inquire into the principles
of the attributes and properties
of complex, as well as primitive,
beings.
</p>

<pb n='174'/><anchor id='Pg174'/>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Principles of substantial compounds.</head>

<p>
By substantial compound we mean
a compound <hi rend='italic'>of which the components
are distinct substances uniting in one
essence or nature</hi>. Such a compound
is a physical one, inasmuch as it is
made up of physical components;
for substances are complete beings,
and each of them has its own distinct
and individual existence in
the physical order of things.
</p>

<p>
This definition of substantial
compound is very different from
that which the scholastics drew
from their theory of substantial
generations. But since chemistry
has shown, and philosophical reasoning
based on facts confirms, that
what in such a theory is called the
<q>generated substance</q> is only a
compound of substances, it must be
evident that our substantial compound,
as above defined, does not,
in fact, differ from theirs, but is the
same thing viewed under a different
light. Perhaps, if the schoolmen
had thought that bodies were possibly
but the result of the composition
of many permanent substances,
they would not have called them
<hi rend='italic'>substantial</hi>, but only <hi rend='italic'>natural</hi>, compounds;
yet, since the epithet <q>substantial</q>
has been originally adopted,
and is still commonly applied to
compounds which we know actually
to contain many distinct substances,
we cannot keep the word <q>substantial</q>
without giving it such a
meaning as will answer to the real
nature of the things it qualifies.
Nevertheless, should the reader
prefer to apply the epithet <q>substantial</q>
to that compound only
which consists of matter and substantial
form interpreted in accordance
with the Peripatetic system,
then the compounds of which we
treat might be called <hi rend='italic'>natural</hi>, or <hi rend='italic'>essential</hi>,
compounds, or <hi rend='italic'>compound natures</hi>.
So long, however, as such
compounds are called <q>substances,</q>
we think we have the right to apply
to them the epithet <q>substantial.</q>
</p>

<p>
The immediate principles of substantial
compound are three, as in
the primitive being: to wit, <hi rend='italic'>act</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>term</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>complement</hi>; but they are
of a different nature, as we are going
to explain. Two cases are to be
examined. For the physical parts,
which unite to make one compound
nature, sometimes rank all alike as
material constituents of the compound,
as in water, iron, silver, and
other natural bodies; but at other
times one of the constituent substances
stands forth in the character
of a form, as the human soul in
the body, all the parts of the body
remaining under it, and making up
the complete material constituent
of the compound nature.
</p>

<p>
In the first case, the physical
components taken together constitute
the adequate <hi rend='italic'>potential term</hi> or
the compound nature; because, as
they are all alike material constituents,
they are all alike potential respecting
their composition; and
thus they are all equally liable to
be tied together by physical action.
The specific composition will be
the <hi rend='italic'>act</hi> of the compound essence;
for it is such a composition that
formally binds together those physical
components into one specific
compound. Finally, the actual
bond of the components, brought
about by their composition, will be
the actuality of the compound nature&mdash;that
is, its formal <hi rend='italic'>complement</hi>.
</p>

<p>
That these three constituents
differ very materially from those of
a primitive being is evident: for,
in a primitive being, <hi rend='italic'>the term</hi> is a
pure potency that receives its first
actuation; whilst in the compound
nature it consists of a number of
actual beings which are no longer
potential respecting their first actuation,
but only with regard to
<pb n='175'/><anchor id='Pg175'/>
their composition, which gives
them a second and relative actuation
in the compound. Again, <hi rend='italic'>the
act</hi>, in the primitive being, is a product
of creation, calculated to give
the first existence to its term; whilst
in the compound nature it is the
product of actions interchanged between
the components, and gives
them, not to exist, but to be united
so as to form a new specific essence.
Lastly, <hi rend='italic'>the complement</hi>, in a primitive
being, is the existence of a
thing absolutely <hi rend='italic'>one</hi>, whilst in the
compound nature it is the existence
of a thing whose oneness is
altogether relative.
</p>

<p>
In all compounds of this kind&mdash;viz.,
whose form is their composition&mdash;the
components are, of course,
physical beings, as we have stated;
but their composition is only a
metaphysical entity. Indeed, we are
wont to call it <q>physical composition</q>;
but we do not mean that it
is a physical being; we only mean
that it is the composition <q>of physical
beings.</q> We know that formal
composition is that by which
the components are formally bound
with one another; and we know also
that the components are thus
bound in consequence of their mutual
actions, and that such actions
cannot be conceived to be complete
in nature, except inasmuch as they
are received in their proper subjects&mdash;viz.,
in the components themselves.
And therefore the composition
which is styled <q>physical</q> is,
of its own nature, only an incomplete
and metaphysical entity; and,
in a like manner, the actuality of the
physical compound is not a physical
being, as it cannot be found outside
of that of which it is the result.
</p>

<p>
But a compound of the kind just
mentioned is sometimes intended
for an end which cannot be attained
without the concurrence of a
higher principle. Then, by the introduction
of this new principle, a
second kind of substantial compound
arises, in which one of the
components (the higher principle)
ranks as the formal, and the others
as the material, constituent of the
compound nature. Such is the
case with our own bodies; which,
to fulfil the ends for which they are
organized by nature, besides their
bodily constitution and organism,
require the infusion of a distinct
principle of life. Hence the <hi rend='italic'>formal</hi>
constituent of man, and of all animals
too, is the principle of life, or
the soul; whilst his <hi rend='italic'>material</hi> constituent
is the body, with its organic
constitution.
</p>

<p>
That the body is a physical being
and a substance there is no
doubt; and that the soul also is a
physical being and a substance distinct
from the body is conclusively
shown in all good treatises of anthropology.
The soul and the body are
therefore two physical components,
and make up a physical compound.
The animal life, however, which is
the result of the animation of the
body by the soul&mdash;and is, therefore,
the <hi rend='italic'>complement</hi> of the compound&mdash;is
not a third physical component,
but a metaphysical entity; and
thus of the three principles which
constitute the animal, the first and
the second only are to be reckoned
as physical parts.
</p>

<p>
And now, since we have stated
that the constituents of compound
natures may have either a physical
or only a metaphysical entity, we
must further inform our readers that
a great number of authors are wont
to consider all the real constituents
of physical beings as so many <hi rend='italic'>physical</hi>
entities. But we would say that
in this they are mistaken; for although
it is evidently true that the
constituent principles of a physical
<pb n='176'/><anchor id='Pg176'/>
being have a physical existence in
the being to which they belong,
it cannot be inferred that therefore
all such principles must be
called <hi rend='italic'>physical</hi> beings; as some
of them can neither have an independent
existence nor be even conceived
without referring to their
correlative principles. Thus the
act and the term of a primitive
being are both entitatively less than
physical beings; for the first being
we find in the physical order is that
which arises out of them. It is not,
therefore, the same thing to say
that a being is physically real, and
to say that it is made up of physical
realities. The first assertion
may be true, and the second false;
because a thing which is <emph>one</emph> has
only <emph>one</emph> existence, and nevertheless
implies three principles;
whence it appears that it is impossible
to conceive each of the
three principles as having a <emph>distinct</emph>
existence. And since that which
has no distinct existence in nature
is not a physical being, accordingly
the principles of primitive physical
beings are not physical, but only
metaphysical, realities.
</p>

<p>
We have further to remark that
the act and the term, even when
they are complete physical entities,
in their manner of principiating the
compound nature always behave
towards one another as incomplete
entities, inasmuch as their principiation
is always of a metaphysical,
and never of a physical, character.
To speak first of those compound
essences whose form is <hi rend='italic'>composition</hi>,
we observe that the physical
components of such essences are
indeed <hi rend='italic'>in act</hi>, absolutely speaking,
but, with regard to the composition,
they are simply <hi rend='italic'>in potency</hi>:
and since it is in this last capacity
that they enter into the constitution
of the compound nature, it is
evident that they contribute to its
constitution only inasmuch as they
have a claim to further actuation.
For to be potential respecting
any kind of composition means
not only that the parts <emph>might</emph> be
duly disposed to undergo such a
composition, but moreover that
they are already disposed and related
to each other in that manner
which <hi rend='italic'>imperatively calls</hi> for
such a composition. Consequently,
the components, when thus
disposed, constitute a potency
which needs actuation, and stands,
with respect to the form of composition,
in the same relation in
which any term stands with respect
to its essential act. It is, therefore,
manifest that the said components,
though they are physical entities,
behave as metaphysical principles
in their material principiation of a
compound essence. As for the
composition itself, we have already
seen that it is always a metaphysical
constituent.
</p>

<p>
In the same manner, the soul
and the body are indeed physical
beings, absolutely speaking, and,
therefore, independent of one another
so far as their existence is
concerned; but the body is informed
and vivified, not inasmuch
as it exists in its absolute actuality,
but inasmuch as it is potential respecting
animal life&mdash;that is, inasmuch
as its organic composition
imperatively claims a soul. And
similarly the soul is a vivifying
form, not inasmuch as it is something
absolute in nature, but inasmuch
as it naturally requires completion
in the body for which it is
created and to which it is actually
terminated. It therefore appears
that the soul and the body, in their
principiation of the animal, behave
towards one another as metaphysical
principles.
</p>

<pb n='177'/><anchor id='Pg177'/>

<p>
Hence all composition of act and
potency is, properly speaking, a
<hi rend='italic'>metaphysical</hi> composition; though,
when the compound is resolvable
into physical parts, the same composition
may also, from the physical
nature of the components, be
rightly styled <hi rend='italic'>physical</hi>. The difference
between a metaphysical and a
physical compound does not, therefore,
consist in the character of the
composition itself, which is always
metaphysical, but in this: that the
latter can be resolved into physical
parts which may and will exist
after their separation, whereas
the former can be resolved only into
metaphysical constituents which are
utterly incapable of separate existence.
</p>

<p>
What precedes refers to the immediate
constituents of compound
essences. It is evident that every immediate
principle, which is a complete
being, involves other principles.
Hence all compound essences
imply some principles which
are <hi rend='italic'>proximate</hi>, and others which are
<hi rend='italic'>remote</hi>. The remote are those by
which every primitive component
is itself constituted in its individual
reality, and from which the components
derive their real aptitude to
become the material, the formal, or
the efficient principle of the compound
essence.

<head>Principles of accidental compounds.</head>

<p>
We have hitherto shown that all
physical beings, whether physically
simple or physically complex, involve
in their constitution an act, a
term, and a formal complement.
Nothing more is required to conclude
that no physical being can
be conceived of as an act without
its term, or a term without its act,
or a formal actuality not resulting
from the concurrence of an act and
its suitable term. From this it immediately
appears that accidents
and accidental modes are not physical
beings, and that their existence
is necessarily dependent on
the existence of some other thing
of which they are the appurtenances.
</p>

<p>
An accident, properly so called,
is <hi rend='italic'>an act having no term of its own</hi>,
and, therefore, having no metaphysical
essence and no possibility of
a separate existence. Accordingly,
the term of which it is in need
must be supplied by a distinct being
already existing in nature; and
this is called <hi rend='italic'>the subject</hi> of the accidental
act. Hence no accidental
act can be conceived to be without
a subject.
</p>

<p>
And here we must reflect that, as
the <emph>first</emph> actuation of an essential
term by its essential act has for its
result the actual <hi rend='italic'>existence</hi> of the individual
being, so also any <emph>second</emph>,
or accidental, actuation of the term
by an accidental act has for its result
an actual <hi rend='italic'>mode of existing</hi> of
the same individual being. From
this plain truth we infer that a distinction
is to be made between <hi rend='italic'>accidental
acts</hi>, which are properly accidents,
and <hi rend='italic'>accidental modes</hi>, which
are only accidentalities. An accident,
properly speaking, is that
which causes the subject to acquire
an accidental actuality, and is always
an act; whilst the accidental
mode is not an act, but an accidental
actuality which results in the
subject from the reception of the
accidental act.
</p>

<p>
These general notions being admitted,
let us inquire into the principles
of accidental compounds.
An accidental compound is either a
compound of substance and accident
or a compound of real essence
with something superadded.
In the first case, <q>accidental</q>
means the opposite of <q>substantial</q>;
in the second case, <q>accidental</q>
<pb n='178'/><anchor id='Pg178'/>
means the opposite of <q>essential.</q>
Thus <hi rend='italic'>a falling body</hi> is an
accidental compound of substance
and its momentum, the momentum
being a real accident; whereas
<hi rend='italic'>a man clothed</hi> is an accidental compound
of individual human nature
and dress; the dress being considered
as something accidental as
compared with the essence of man,
though it is a real substance. And
in the same manner a mass of gold
is an accidental compound of golden
molecules, because each molecule
fully possesses the essence of
gold independently of any other
molecule; whence it follows that
the addition of other molecules is
accidental as compared with the
essence of gold, and only increases
the quantity without altering the
specific nature of gold. Of course,
these other molecules are substances,
and it is only their concurrence
into one mass that is accidental.
</p>

<p>
It is plain that the constituent
principles of an accidental compound
are three&mdash;viz., <hi rend='italic'>the accidental
act</hi> which entails a modification of
the subject; <hi rend='italic'>the subject</hi> which receives
the modifying act; and <hi rend='italic'>the
accidental mode</hi> of being, or the
modification, which results from
the reception of the act in the subject.
</p>

<p>
The subject is always a complete
physical being, and, therefore, has
its own essential act, term, and
complement, independently of all
things accidental. It becomes the
subject of an accidental act by actually
receiving it.
</p>

<p>
The accidental act which is received
in the subject must proceed
immediately from the action of some
natural or supernatural agent. This
is evident; for real receptivity is
real passivity, and therefore reception
is passion. Now, no passion
can be admitted without a corresponding
action. Hence all accidental
act that is properly and
truly <hi rend='italic'>received</hi> in a subject is the
immediate product of action, and
its production exactly coincides
and coextends with its reception.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, the mode of being which
results from the accidental actuation
of the subject is only an accidentality,
or an accidental actuality, as
we have already remarked, and is
predicated of the subject, not as
something <hi rend='italic'>received</hi> in it, but as
something following from the actual
reception of the accidental act.
Hence the substance, or the nature,
which is the subject of such accidental
modes lies under them, not
on account of its receptivity, but
on account of the resulting potentiality,
which is a proper appurtenance,
not of the material term, but
of the formal complement of the
substance. And, in fact, the complement
of all created essence always
arises from the actuation of a
potential term, and therefore is itself
necessarily potential&mdash;that is,
liable to such accidental changes as
may result from any new actuation
of the essential term. This resulting
potentiality is commonly styled
<hi rend='italic'>mobility</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>changeableness</hi>, or <hi rend='italic'>affectibility</hi>,
and may be called <hi rend='italic'>modal</hi> potentiality
in opposition to the <hi rend='italic'>passive</hi>
potentiality which is the characteristic
of the essential term.
</p>

<p>
Hence a subject is said to <hi rend='italic'>receive</hi>
the accidental act, but not the accidental
mode; and, on the contrary,
is said to <hi rend='italic'>be affected</hi> by the accidental
mode, but not by the accidental
act. We may say, however,
that a subject <hi rend='italic'>is modified</hi> as well by
the act as by the mode, because
this expression applies equally to
the making of the change (<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>mutatio
in fieri</foreign>) and to the state that follows
(<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>mutatio in facto esse</foreign>).
</p>

<pb n='179'/><anchor id='Pg179'/>

<p>
A subject has, therefore, two distinct
manners of <hi rend='italic'>underlying</hi>: the
one on account of its receptivity,
the other on account of its affectibility;
the one by reason of the
<hi rend='italic'>passive</hi> potentiality of its term, the
other by reason of the <hi rend='italic'>modal</hi> potentiality
of its complement. Thus a
body, according to its passive potentiality,
underlies the <hi rend='italic'>act</hi> produced
in it by a motive power, because it
passively receives the motive determination,
and, according to its modal
potentiality, it underlies <hi rend='italic'>local
movement</hi>, this movement being the
immediate result of the determination
received. And in a similar
manner our soul, inasmuch as it is
receptive or passive, underlies the
act produced or the impression
made in it by a cognizable object;
and inasmuch as it is affectible, it
underlies the feeling or affective
movement, which immediately results
from the cognition of the object.
</p>

<p>
We have said that every accident
which is received in a subject and inheres
in it must be produced by the
action of some agent; and this being
the case, it follows that the quantity
of the mass of a body, and the quantity
of its volume, which are not the
product of action, cannot be ranked
among the accidents received and
inhering in the body; and generally
all the accidental modes which arise
in the subject, in consequence of
the reception of accidental acts, are
intrinsic modes indeed, but are not
received, and do not properly <hi rend='italic'>inhere</hi>
in their subject; they only <hi rend='italic'>result</hi>
in the subject. Moreover, as
all such intrinsic modes immediately
arise from the intrinsic reception
of accidental acts, it follows that
those accidental modes which do
not arise in this manner must be
<hi rend='italic'>extrinsic</hi>; and therefore such modes,
though they are predicated of their
subject, do not inhere in the subject,
but only in a certain manner
<hi rend='italic'>adhere</hi> to it. All accidental connotations
and relativities belong to
this last class.
</p>

<p>
Hence we gather that predicamental
accidents are of different
species, and accordingly demand
distinct definitions. The accidental
act, or accident strictly, is an
act received in the subject and inhering
in it; the intrinsic mode is
an accidental actuality or modification
resulting in the subject; the
extrinsic mode is a simple connotation
or respect arising between
the subject and some correlative
term. Accordingly, accidental being
in general cannot be defined as
<q>that which inheres in a subject</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>quod
inhæret alteri tamquam subjecto</foreign>&mdash;for
this definition does not
embrace all accidentalities, but
should be defined as <q>that which
clings to a subject</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>quod innititur
alteri tamquam subjecto</foreign>, the phrase
<q>to cling to</q> being understood in
a most general sense. This last
definition covers all the ground of
predicamental accidentalities; for
it is, in fact, applicable to all accidental
acts, intrinsic modes of being,
and extrinsic connotations.
</p>

<p>
For the same reason, the subject
is not to be defined as <q>that which
receives within itself an accidental
entity,</q> but as <q>that to which an
accidental entity belongs,</q> and,
taking the word <q>subject</q> in its
most general sense, we may also
define it, as Aristotle did, to be <q>that
of which anything is predicated.</q>
It is only by this last definition that
we can explain the general practice
of predicating of everything, not
only its accidentalities, but also its
attributes and essential properties.
Such predications would be impossible,
if the notion of subject were
restricted to that which receives on
<pb n='180'/><anchor id='Pg180'/>
itself accidental entities; for attributes
are not accidents, and are
not received in their subject, but
spring forth from its very essence,
as we are going presently to show.
</p>

<p>
When the thing predicated of any
subject is an accidental act, then its
subject is <hi rend='italic'>a subject of inhesion</hi>.
When the thing predicated is an
intrinsic mode, no matter whether
essential, substantial, or accidental,
then its subject is <hi rend='italic'>a subject of attribution</hi>.
And when the thing predicated
is only a connotation or a respect
(<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>modus se habendi ad aliud</foreign>),
then its subject is <hi rend='italic'>a subject of mere
predication</hi>.
</p>

<p>
As we have stated that natural
accidents cannot exist without a
subject, the reader may desire to
know how we can account for the
accidents which, in the Holy Eucharist,
exist without their substances.
As a lengthy discussion
of this philosophico-theological
question would be here quite out
of place, we will content ourselves
with remarking that the Eucharistic
species of bread, as described
by S. Thomas and by the ancient
scholastics, is not a natural and
predicamental accident; and that,
therefore, many things may be possible
with the Eucharistic species
which are not possible with natural
accidents. It is not true, in fact,
what some have maintained, that in
the Holy Eucharist <emph>each</emph> of the accidents
of bread exists without any
subject. Theologians acknowledge
that the quantity of the bread fulfils
the duty of subject with regard to
all the other accidents, and consequently
that all the other accidents,
after the consecration as before,
cling to quantity. There is no
need, therefore, of assuming color
without a subject, or figure without
a subject, or weight without a subject.
This would simply mean
color of nothing, figure of nothing,
weight of nothing; which is not a
miracle, but an absurdity. To account
for the sacramental species,
theologians need only to show that
the <emph>quantity</emph> of the bread can exist
miraculously without the substance
of the bread. This is the only accident
which remains without any
subject whatever; for the Sacred
Body, which <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ad modum substantiæ</foreign>&mdash;that
is, substantively, replaces the
substance of the bread&mdash;is indeed
under that quantity, but it is not
affected nor modified by it, and
therefore cannot be called its <hi rend='italic'>subject</hi>
in the ordinary sense of the
word, though some writers have
called it a <hi rend='italic'>sacramental subject</hi>.
</p>

<p>
To show that quantity without
the substance of which it is the
quantity is not an impossibility, we
must leave aside the idea that such
a quantity is <hi rend='italic'>a form inherent</hi> in the
substance. For the quantity of the
mass which alone is destined to become
the first subject of all the
other accidents is made up of a
number of material parts, and
therefore is not a form, but a certain
amount of actual matter, and
<hi rend='italic'>fulfils the office of matter</hi>, as S. Thomas
recognizes, and not that of
form, as Suarez and others after
him have erroneously assumed.
Now, it is evident that as no number
can be conceived without units,
so neither can a quantity of mass
be conceived without its parts; and
that, if such parts or units are substances,
the quantity of the mass
will be nothing less than a number
of substances. So long, then, as
such a quantity remains, it cannot
cease to be a number of substances,
unless, indeed, each of the units of
which it is made up, <hi rend='italic'>and which
must always remain</hi>, be supernaturally
deprived of that which places
them formally in the rank of substances.
<pb n='181'/><anchor id='Pg181'/>
This is, therefore, what
must be done, and what is really
done by transubstantiation. When,
in fact, the words of the consecration
are pronounced, and the Sacred
Body of our Lord is constituted
under the sensible symbol <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ad modum
substantiæ</foreign> (that is, not only substantially,
but substantively), then the
substantiality of every particle of
the bread is superseded, and, so to
say, supplanted by the new substance
which lies under each of
them, but which leaves intact the
constituents of concrete quantity;
for <q>the act and the power of substance,</q>
and <q>whatever belongs to
matter,</q> remains in each of them, as
S. Thomas teaches, in accordance
with the common doctrine of the
ancient scholastics and of the fathers
of the church.
</p>

<p>
Thus the quantity of the bread
remains the same as before, and
<hi rend='italic'>retains its formal and material constitution</hi>,
notwithstanding the substantial
conversion of the bread
into the Sacred Body of our Lord.
Had the modern scholastics paid
more attention to this last point,
they would have seen that the
species of bread is none of those
natural accidents, whether forms
or formalities, which found a place
in Aristotle's categories, but is a
supernatural accident as perfectly
constituted, in its own way, as substance
itself, and therefore capable
of being kept in existence by God
without the help of a natural subject.
The reader may infer from
these remarks that the philosophical
questions about <hi rend='italic'>natural</hi> or
predicamental accidents are altogether
distinct from, and independent
of, those concerning the sacramental
species; and that therefore
nothing that philosophers may
say about <hi rend='italic'>natural</hi> accidents can
have any direct bearing on the
explanation of the Eucharistic mystery.
</p>

<p>
One thing remains to be said
regarding the distinction between
accidental and substantial compounds.
We have defined the first
to be a compound <q>of substance
and accident,</q> or a compound <q>of
essence and something accidentally
superadded to it.</q> The second
we defined to be a compound
<q>of substances uniting in
one essence or nature.</q> But, as
we noticed, the authors pledged to
the theory of substantial generations
admitted of no <q>substantial</q>
compound but that which was believed
to consist of matter and
substantial form; and accordingly
all compounds the form of which
was an accidental entity, say <hi rend='italic'>composition</hi>,
were considered by them
as accidental. We observe that
composition, though an accidental
entity, is nevertheless the <q>essential</q>
form of the compound, and
gives it its <q>first</q> actuality. If,
then, the compound is a distinct
essence, and has a distinct name,
and is called a distinct <q>substance,</q>
as water, iron, gold, etc.,
its form, though an accident, is an
essential constituent of the specific
substance.
</p>

<p>
We cannot at present discuss
the question of substantial generations;
we only remark that, to
avoid all useless disputes about
words, a physical compound, when
it contains nothing but what is
needed for the constitution of its
specific nature, may be called
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Unum per se naturale</foreign>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, a being
essentially one; and when it has
something accidentally superadded,
it may be called <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Unum per accidens</foreign>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>,
a being accidentally
one. This distinction of names,
which is familiar to all philosophers,
expresses the distinction
<pb n='182'/><anchor id='Pg182'/>
of the things without having recourse
to the terms of <q>substantial
compound</q> and <q>accidental compound,</q>
taken in the Peripatetic
sense of the words. Thus, whilst
the Peripatetics based their distinction
between these compounds
on a presumed difference between
their forms, we draw our own from
the presence or absence of anything
not belonging to the specific
nature of the compound. This we
do in accordance with the true
spirit of scholastic philosophy, not
to say compelled by a philosophical
necessity; for we know that
the constituent form of a purely
material compound, though essential
with respect to the compound
itself, is only an accident received
in the substance of the components,
as we may hereafter have an
occasion to show. And now let us
come to the attributes of complete
beings.
</p>

<div>

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Principles of attributes and properties.</head>

<p>
All complete beings possess
attributes and properties called <hi rend='italic'>essential</hi>&mdash;that
is, invariably following
the essence to which they belong.
It is therefore necessary for us to
inquire whether, to account for
them, any special principles must
be admitted. We can easily show
that no new real principle is required
besides the principles of the
essence, as all the essential attributes
and properties<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Attribute</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>property</hi> mean the same in
reality; but we usually call them <hi rend='italic'>attributes</hi>
with respect to the thing absolutely considered
as a being, and <hi rend='italic'>properties</hi> with respect to the
thing considered as a principle of operation.</note> of a complete
being are fully contained in
the real essence of the same as
in their fountain-head, inasmuch
as they are nothing else than
<hi rend='italic'>the actuality</hi> of the essence considered
under different aspects or
connotations. It is known, in
fact, that the essential attributes of
things are said by all philosophers
<hi rend='italic'>to emanate</hi> from the essence, <hi rend='italic'>to flow</hi>
from the essence, <hi rend='italic'>to follow</hi> from
the essence, without any other
thing being ever mentioned as
their principle; which shows the
universality of the doctrine that
the essence alone is the adequate
<hi rend='italic'>source</hi> of all its attributes.
</p>

<p>
And here let us observe that the
words <hi rend='italic'>principle</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>source</hi> are not
synonymous; for a principle is
not sufficient, of itself, to principiate
anything without the concurrence
of other principles, as it
does not perfectly contain in itself
the whole reality of which it is a
principle. The source, on the contrary,
contains totally and adequately
within itself whatever emanates
from it; so that any such emanation,
taken separately, is only an
imperfect exhibition of the reality
from which it emanates, as it presents
it only under one out of the
many different points of view under
which it may be regarded. To
say, then, that the essence of a
thing is the source of all its attributes
is to say that the essence
itself alone sufficiently accounts for
their origin, their necessity, and
their distinction.
</p>

<p>
That such is the case we shall
easily understand by reflecting that
all the essential attributes and
properties of a thing express the
<hi rend='italic'>being</hi> or actuality of the thing under
some special aspect; as <hi rend='italic'>to be</hi>
active, <hi rend='italic'>to be</hi> passive, <hi rend='italic'>to be</hi> one, <hi rend='italic'>to be</hi>
simple, etc. Now, <hi rend='italic'>to be</hi>, or actuality,
immediately results from the
principles of the essence alone, as
we have proved in our last article.
Consequently, the essential attributes
and properties of anything
immediately result from the essential
principles of the thing&mdash;that is,
from its real essence. Thus a being
is active inasmuch as the act
<pb n='183'/><anchor id='Pg183'/>
by which it is can be further terminated;
and therefore <hi rend='italic'>to be active</hi>
is nothing more than to have in
itself an act further terminable;
and activity, or active power in the
abstract, is nothing more than the
further terminability of the same
act. In like manner, a being is
passive inasmuch as its intrinsic
term is still capable of further
actuation; and therefore <hi rend='italic'>to be passive</hi>
is nothing more than to have
in itself a term which can be further
actuated; and passivity, or
passive potentiality in the abstract,
is nothing more than the further
actuability of the same term. The
like may be said of every other
attribute. Meanwhile, if we inquire
what does <hi rend='italic'>terminability</hi>, or
<hi rend='italic'>actuability</hi>, add to the thing, we
shall soon see that it adds nothing
real, but only exhibits the reality
of the thing under a special formality
as connoting something either
intrinsic or extrinsic to it. Thus
the terminability of the act simply
connotes some term capable of
actuation, and the actuability of
the term simply connotes an act
by which it can be actuated.
</p>

<p>
From this it follows that the
essential attributes of being are
nothing but distinct <hi rend='italic'>abstract ratios</hi>
having their foundation in the
principles of the complete being,
and presenting its actuality under
different aspects. In fact, it is because
such a being contains the
foundation of all those ratios that
our intellect, by looking upon it,
is enabled to discover them, and
to trace them distinctly to their
distinct principles. It thus appears
that the true reason why no
new real principles are needed to
account for the essential attributes
of things consists in this, that the
whole reality of the attributes already
pre-exists in the thing, and
that nothing further is necessary,
that they may be distinctly conceived,
but intellectual consideration.
</p>

<p>
What we have said of the attributes
that have their foundation in
the essential principles of being applies
equally to qualities which are
the immediate result of accidental
actuation. Thus, if a material point
be acted on, the result of the determination
it receives will be <hi rend='italic'>velocity</hi>.
Of course, velocity is an accidental
attribute, since it follows from
the termination of an accidental
act; yet it results as perfectly from
that termination as the essential
attributes result from the termination
of the essential act.
</p>

<p>
In general, all the objective
ratios which immediately follow the
constitution of a concrete being
need no additional principles, because
they are already contained in
the entity of the concrete being,
in which the intellect finds its
ground for their distinct conception.
And here let us add two remarks.
The first is that all such
intelligible ratios identify themselves
really, though inadequately,
with the concrete entity of which
they are predicated; so that between
the attribute and its concrete
subject there can be but
the slightest of metaphysical distinctions.
The second is that the
essential attributes of a <hi rend='italic'>simple</hi> being
are never <hi rend='italic'>really</hi> distinct from one
another. The reason of this is
evident; for such attributes are the
simple actuality of a simple being,
which does not cease to be identical
with itself when it is viewed from
different points of view. They admit,
however, of a distinction of
reason; for when the same thing is
considered under different aspects,
the distinct concepts that are then
formed by the mind evidently exhibit
<pb n='184'/><anchor id='Pg184'/>
distinct objective ratios, every
one of which corresponds to one of
those aspects without formally implying
the others.
</p>

<p>
Though we have hitherto spoken
of the essential attributes and properties
of <hi rend='italic'>primitive</hi> beings, the
doctrine we have expounded is also
applicable to those of all substantial
compounds. Thus the attributes
and properties of a molecule
of hydrogen, oxygen, or any other
specific compound have the reason
of their being in the essential principles
of their respective compound,
and nothing else is required to account
for them, as is evident from
the preceding explanations. It is
to be observed, however, that in
such compounds as owe their being
to material composition only, as it
is the case with all the molecules
of natural bodies, the composition
which is the essential form of the
compound is not a substantial, but
an accidental, determination of the
components; and hence it is that
each such molecule involves in its
essential constitution <hi rend='italic'>both substance
and accident</hi>, and therefore is not
exactly a substance, but a natural
compound essence. The consequence
is that its essential attributes,
too, owe their being not only
to the component substances, but
also to such accidents as are essentially
implied in the constitution of
the compound. Thus, <hi rend='italic'>porosity</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>compressibility</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>bulk</hi>, etc., which are
essential attributes of each molecule
as such, have the reason of their
being partly in the elements of
which they are made up, and partly
in the specific form of their composition.
Now, this specific form
may undergo accidental changes
<hi rend='italic'>without trespassing the bounds of its
species</hi>; and those essential attributes
which depend on the specific
composition may consequently undergo
a change in their degree;
and since none of those changeable
degrees are determinately required
by the essence of the molecular
compound, it follows that the essential
attributes and properties of
each molecule, in so far as their
actual degree is concerned, are
accidental; and accordingly such
attributes and properties by their
degree belong to the predicament
of accidental <hi rend='italic'>quality</hi>. Such is the
case with the attributes of every
single molecule of a natural substance.
</p>

<p>
As for bodies made up of a number
of molecules of the same kind,
it is evident that all such bodies
are accidental compounds, and
none of them can have any other
essential attributes besides those
which are common to their molecules.
For the union of equal
molecules is the union of <hi rend='italic'>integrant</hi>
parts, and gives rise to no new
species, but only to accidental relations,
quantity of mass, and
quantity of volume; and consequently
all the attributes and properties
originating in the agglomeration
of such integrant parts are
simply accidental qualities. Thus
<hi rend='italic'>liquidity</hi> is an accidental quality of
water, because it exhibits only the
mutual behavior of distinct molecules
which, of themselves, and
apart from one another, are not
liquid, though they have all that is
needed to unite in the liquid state.
And indeed, if each molecule contains
the true essence of water, and
yet is not actually liquid, actual
liquidity has nothing to do with
the essence of water, and therefore
is not an essential attribute of
water, but an accidental mode resulting
from mutual accidental action
between neighboring molecules.
</p>

<p>
There are two cases, however, in
<pb n='185'/><anchor id='Pg185'/>
which new essential attributes may
be found in a body without being
found in the component molecules.
The first is when the component
molecules undergo chemical combination;
for in this case such
molecules are not merely integrant
but <hi rend='italic'>constituent</hi>, and by their combination
a new essence is formed.
Now, a new essence gives rise to
new essential attributes. Thus
sulphuric acid, for instance, has
attributes which do not belong to
its components.
</p>

<p>
The second case is when the
whole body is only a part of the
compound essence&mdash;that is, when
the specific form of that essence is
a distinct substance, as in man and
all animals, whose bodies are informed
by a soul. In this case,
the whole body and all that belongs
to its organic constitution is involved
in the essence of the perfect
compound of which it is a part;
and therefore some among the
essential attributes of the compound
must depend on the very constitution
of the body. Thus <hi rend='italic'>stature</hi>
follows from the essential constitution
of man, which includes a body
having dimensions. But here, again,
we must observe that, although to
have some stature is an essential
attribute of man, to have <emph>this</emph> stature
rather than that is an accidental
quality; it being evident that
human nature can exist without <emph>this</emph>
determinate stature.
</p>

<p>
By the preceding remarks we are
led to conclude, 1st, that all essential
attributes originate in the essential
constituents of the nature of which
they are the attributes; 2d, that
all the accidental attributes or
qualities originate in the accidental
determinations of the nature of
which they are the accidental
qualities; 3d, that, in material
compounds, those essential attributes
which depend on the composition
admit of different accidental
degrees.
</p>

<p>
We have only to add that the
abstract ratios, through which the
attributes and properties of things
are conceived, are very frequently
styled <hi rend='italic'>formalities</hi>. Formalities are,
generally speaking, either <hi rend='italic'>real</hi> or
<hi rend='italic'>logical</hi>. A real formality is that
which has its being in the reality
of things; a logical formality, on
the contrary, is that which has no
being in real things, but only in our
conception.
</p>

<p>
Real formalities are also called
<hi rend='italic'>metaphysical degrees</hi>. Thus, in
Socrates, animality, rationality, individuality,
personality, etc., are so
many metaphysical degrees. All
such degrees express the <hi rend='italic'>being</hi> of
the thing under some particular
aspect; as to be animated, to be
rational, to be an individual, etc.,
as we have above remarked.
</p>

<p>
Real formalities are either <hi rend='italic'>absolute</hi>
or <hi rend='italic'>respective</hi>. The absolute
are those which belong to the thing
considered in itself absolutely; as
substantiality, oneness, singularity.
The respective are those which
imply a connotation of something
else; as terminability, passivity,
cognoscibility. The absolute formalities
correspond to the absolute
attributes of beings; the respective
correspond to the relative attributes&mdash;that
is, to the properties and
qualities of beings.
</p>

<p>
Real formalities are either <hi rend='italic'>positive</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>negative</hi>, or <hi rend='italic'>privative</hi>. The
positive are directly founded on
the <hi rend='italic'>act</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>term</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>complement</hi> of the
being; as activity, passivity, and
inertia. The negative are real negations
affecting the thing; as the
mode of substance, which is a negation
of sustentation. The privative
are real privations, as blindness
in man.
</p>

<pb n='186'/><anchor id='Pg186'/>

<p>
We may observe, by the way,
that the logical formalities are likewise
either positive, negative, or
privative. The positive exhibit
the thing as a positive element of
logical thought; as when <hi rend='italic'>man</hi> is
said to be <hi rend='italic'>the subject</hi> of a proposition.
The negative exhibit the
thing as affected by a negation
which is not in the thing, but only
in our conception of it; as when
we say that God's immensity and
eternity are distinct; for distinction
is a negation of identity, but
the distinction in this case is only
mental, because those two attributes
are the same thing in reality. The
privative exhibit the thing as mentally
stripped of that which is due
to it; as when we consider color,
figure, velocity, etc., as formally
universal, and therefore as deprived
of a subject; for they cannot be
deprived of a subject except in our
conception.
</p>

<p>
This is what we had to say about
attributes and properties. As we
have here and there mentioned
inadequate identity, metaphysical
distinction, distinction of reason,
etc., we will take care to have the
meaning of these words accurately
explained in our next article, in
which we hope to end this our
cursory survey of the principles of
real being.

<p>
That day was February 25,
1848. If you remember, there
had never been seen, at that season,
such mild weather and such brilliant
sunshine. But that the trees
were without leaves, it seemed like
May; and in the orchards exposed
to the south, the almond-trees were
even covered with big buds ready
to flower.
</p>

<p>
This beautiful, early spring rejoiced
all on the earth, both men
and beasts; the peasants were
heard singing in the fields, the
horses neighing at the plough, the
hens clucking, the sparrows chirping,
the lambs bleating; and down
to the babbling brooks, that flowed
and leaped over the stones with
more than ordinary rapidity, each
creature, in its own way, appeared
happy and glad.
</p>

<p>
The <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign> walked along slowly, a
little fatigued by the heat, to which
he was not yet accustomed. He
closed his Breviary, and thought
of the dear family he was about to
rejoice with his good news, and
doubtless, also, of the exile, who
only waited for one word to return
to his beloved home.
</p>

<p>
When he reached the right of the
barns at Muiceron, he paused a
moment behind the cottage to take
breath and wipe his forehead.
From that spot he could see into
the courtyard without being seen;
and what he saw, although very
simple, moved him to the bottom
of his soul.
</p>

<p>
Jeanne Ragaud was drawing water
from the well; but, instead of
carrying off the buckets already
filled, she deposited them on the
ground, and, resting her elbows on
the curbstone of the well, covered
her face with her hands in the
attitude of a person completely
overcome.
</p>

<p>
He knew she was weeping, and
certainly her poor heart must have
been full of sorrow that she should
give way to such silent grief. The
good <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign> could no longer restrain
himself; he advanced gently behind
her, and, when quite near, touched
her on the shoulder, just as he had
done in former days, when he wished
to surprise her in some school-girl's
trick.
</p>

<p>
Jeanne turned around, and he saw
her pretty face bathed in tears.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! oh!</q> said the kind pastor,
smiling, <q>what are you doing, my
daughter? I wager you are the
only one who is not rejoicing to-day
in the bright sunshine that
the good God gives us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Father,</q> said the little thing,
who always thus addressed our <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign>
when they were alone, <q>it is perhaps
very wrong, but it is precisely all
this joy I see around me that breaks
my heart. When I reached the well,
I thought how often Jean-Louis had
come to this very place to draw
water for us, and how displeased
he was when my mother wished to
do it herself. Poor Jeannet! he
was so gentle and kind! Oh! I am
sure he is unhappy away from home.</q>
</p>

<pb n='188'/><anchor id='Pg188'/>

<p>
<q>That is not doubtful,</q> replied
the <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign>; <q>but perhaps one day we
will see him again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I begin to despair of it,</q> said
she. <q>He left heart-broken, and
perhaps now he detests me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps? Perhaps, my daughter,
can mean yes as well as no;
why should it not be no?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! if I only knew!</q> said she.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, what would you do?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I would write to him that I
love him,</q> she cried, clasping her
hands; <q>and I would beg him to
come and tell me that he pardons
me, and take his place again at
home; for the house will always be
his, whether I live or die; and although
I have done very wrong,
he would listen to me, don't you
think so, father?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> said the <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign>, much touched;
<q>he is a person who never
cherished rancor against any one.
Write to him, my child, and tell
him all you wish; your letter will
reach him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! you know where he is? I
thought so,</q> said she joyfully.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, indeed! I know where he
is, and I will now tell you, my dear
daughter. He is in Paris, where
he wants for nothing; and if you
are good, if you will stop crying, I
will read you some of his letters,
which will make you happy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! I promise you that I will
be good. I will not cry any more&mdash;never
again,</q> cried the poor little
creature, who instantly began to
sob, by way of keeping her promise.
</p>

<p>
But they were tears of joy this
time, and the <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign> let them flow
without reproof. They entered
Muiceron together, and Jeannette,
without any preambulation, threw
herself on her mother's breast, crying
out that Jeannet was coming
back. Pierrette, who desired it as
ardently as she, asked to be excused
for one moment, that she might
run off and tell Ragaud, who was
sowing clover near the house. It
was right that they should be all
together to hear such welcome
news; but scarcely had the good
woman reached the door, than she
knocked against Jacques Michou,
who had just crossed the threshold.
</p>

<p>
<q>Jean-Louis! Jean-Louis is coming
back!</q> said Pierrette, as she
passed him. <q>Come in, Jacques
Michou; I will be back in a
second.</q>
</p>

<p>
Michou entered in his usual tranquil
manner. He saluted the <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign>
and Jeanne without showing the
least excitement.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who says that Jeannet is coming
back?</q> he asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>We don't say he is coming
back,</q> replied the <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign>, <q>but that
he will return home.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All very well,</q> answered Michou;
<q>but, for the present, that is
not to be thought of.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My God!</q> cried Jeanne, <q>what
has happened?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The revolution in Paris,</q> said
Michou; <q>and this time it is real.
Here is a letter from M. le Marquis,
who tells me that in three days from
now all will be fire and blood. He
orders me to join him&mdash;Jeannet is
with him&mdash;and I will take guns for
everybody.</q>
</p>

<p>
Jeannette fell fainting in a chair.
M. le Curé conversed with Michou;
and, meanwhile, Ragaud and Pierrette
entered, and learned, in their
turn, the event, which was very true,
as we all know. I leave you to
think if there were ahs! and ohs!
and exclamations of all kinds. For
a full hour there were so many contradictory
statements you would
have thought the revolution at
Paris transported to Muiceron. Several
peasants, returning from the
<pb n='189'/><anchor id='Pg189'/>
city, stopped at the farm, and reported
there was agitation everywhere;
that a great number of
workmen in the factories had decamped;
and, as under similar circumstances
all sorts of stories are
told and believed, it was added that
half the capital was already burnt,
and that smoke was seen in all the
other parts of the city. At that,
Michou shrugged his shoulders; but
he was anxious about his master,
whom he knew to be the man to do
a thousand imprudent things, so he
took a hasty farewell of his friends,
and that very evening passed Muiceron
in full rig, armed and equipped,
ready for his post.
</p>

<p>
So once again everybody at Muiceron
became gloomy and miserable,
as each day brought its fresh contingent
of sad news. For if, in the
city and among learned men, where
there is every chance of correct information,
every one appears half
crazy in time of public calamity,
and in a fever to talk all kinds of
nonsense, you can imagine what it
is in a village, where one is obliged
to listen to the neighbors and gossips,
who always improve on the
most absurd reports. It is true,
also, that they never see a paper,
and it is lucky if they preserve a
few gleams of good sense; but what
each one draws from his own private
source amply suffices to bewilder
everybody.
</p>

<p>
I, who speak to you, and who was
very young at the time of this revolution,
remember well to have heard
it positively affirmed that the king,
Louis Philippe, and his family had
been crucified in front of their château,
then cut in little pieces, boiled,
and eaten by the people! And
when, in addition, it was said that
the waters of the Seine had formed a
magnificent cascade from the heaped-up
corpses, and were red with
blood as far as the bridge at Rouen,
I did not think the thing incredible,
and, with great simplicity, I always
awaited still more extraordinary
news.
</p>

<p>
I remember, also, that a band of
our most respectable young men
took turns every night in mounting
guard around the château of Val-Saint,
because it was known, from
a trustworthy source, that the cellars
contained more than a hundred
barrels of powder, ready to blow up
at the shortest notice. Now, to ask
how so many barrels, the least of
which weighed as much as a tun of
wine, could have been placed there
without being seen, is what no person
thought of; and the reflection,
what man, sufficiently desirous of
putting an end to his days by bringing
that enormous building down
upon him (a thing which could
profit no one), would be capable of
setting fire to the powder, still less
entered their heads; and yet terror
was at its height at the mere thought
of an explosion so tremendous that
it would have broken all windows
for two leagues round. And thus
it is that good people, without wishing
it, lend their hands to the revolution.
</p>

<p>
It was not that all this was believed
at Muiceron as readily as I
swallowed it, but, in reality, they
were very anxious, and ardently desirous
of hearing news. A long week
passed. M. Michou wrote a short
letter, in which he said everybody
was well, that M. le Marquis and
Jean-Louis were always together,
and cried out, <q>Long live the king!</q>
in the streets while carrying a white
flag, which made the boys of the
street laugh, but at which no one
took any exception. He added that
King Louis Philippe was driven out,
and that for the present the republic
was much spoken of. Thereupon
<pb n='190'/><anchor id='Pg190'/>
Ragaud declared that all was lost;
for he, like all those of his age,
only understood the republic as accompanied
by scaffolds, drownings,
and robberies, as in that of 1793,
which he well remembered.
</p>

<p>
Jeannette, then, with the consent
of M. le Curé, wrote a long and
touching letter, which she addressed
to Solange, in which she poured
forth all the warmth and fire of her
little heart. The poor child dared
not write directly to Jeannet, in
the fear that new events might prevent
his receiving the missive; but
she did not doubt that Solange
would find means to read it to him
who would receive so much consolation
from its contents. The misfortune
was that, in the midst of
the fray, that good girl could hear
nothing about her old friend; and,
between ourselves, it was, I believe,
because she had no permission to
mix herself up in the affair, as she
lived retired and absorbed in prayer
with the other young sisters of the
novitiate. It therefore followed
that when Jeannet, in his turn,
wrote to M. le Curé, it seemed, from
the quiet, sad, and cold tone of
his letter, that he knew nothing of
this step of Jeannette's, or, if he
knew it, he attached no importance
to it, and wished them to understand
it was too late to repair matters.
</p>

<p>
It was this last idea which fastened
itself in the child's head as firmly
as a nail in the wood. She became
profoundly sad, which, according
to her habit, she concealed as much
as possible; and thus passed weeks
and months without anything further
being said of the return of the
dear boy, so fondly desired by all at
Muiceron.
</p>

<p>
So far affairs in Paris went on
quietly, and the people who believed
in scaffolds began to think
they might sign the lease between
their shoulders and heads. For
now that all this fine story is over,
it must be avowed the first part of
the revolution was more laughable
than terrible. I had it from
Michou, who was present and witnessed
many things in detail, which
were served up for our amusement
during many of the following winters.
The good man never wearied
of relating how the great city of Paris,
that had driven off a king from a
desire of giving herself a hundred
thousand in his place, played at
comedy for three months, for the
sole purpose, I suppose, of affording
other countries a perpetual diversion.
Once, for example, in remembrance
of spring-time, a crowd
of little trees were planted at all
the corners, as signs of liberty; and
as, for this amusement, each man
became a gardener on his own hook,
without ever having learned the
trade, you can imagine what chance
these precious emblems of freedom
had of flourishing. It is not necessary
to say that they fell down
and were trodden under foot in a
very short time, so that the beautiful
green ornaments were renounced
at the end of a few days!
</p>

<p>
Another time, the street-boys
assembled and formed the brilliant
resolution that they would have a
general illumination. And then&mdash;I
really would not have believed it,
if Jacques Michou had not vouched
for the truth&mdash;these ragamuffins
ran in troops through the streets,
hand-in-hand, shouting out a song
which had but two words, always
sung to the same tune.
</p>

<p>
<q>Light up! light up!</q> they
cried at the top of their voices;
upon which, all classes, rich and
poor, high and low, obediently
placed candles in the windows,
without daring to utter a word
<pb n='191'/><anchor id='Pg191'/>
against the decree; and this lasted
more than a fortnight.
</p>

<p>
I will only ask, if the king or
our holy father, the Pope, had exacted
such a thing even once, what
would have been said? There
was also the farce of the laborers,
who were out of work, taking the
air, and marching by thousands
along the quays to the great
château, where five or six fine men
who were called the government resided,
and who were very brave in
words, but became half crazy when
it was time to act; which must not
be wondered at, as their task was
none of the easiest. The men arrived,
they would send one of
their number to ask some little
favor, which was sure to be promised
for next day. Then they returned
the same as they came,
and so much the worse for those
who were found in their way that
day; for not a cat could have come
out alive among so many legs.
This amusement was called <q>a
manifestation.</q> But to say what
was ever manifested except want
and misery in every house&mdash;for
when such promenades are made,
no work is done&mdash;is what you may
learn, perhaps, sooner than I, if the
day of discovery will ever come.
</p>

<p>
During this time, they pretended
to make laws for the country,
in a large building where a great
number of men from the provinces
talked themselves hoarse every
day, insulting each other, and even,
I have been told, flung whatever
they happened to have near at
hand at one another's heads; so
that he who appeared the master
of all, and was called president,
was forced to speak with a great
bell, as he could no longer make
his voice heard. For those who
liked noise all this row was very
amusing; but quiet people were
obliged to shut their eyes and stop
up their ears. In my opinion, instead
of being contented with that,
they should have descended into
the streets, and enforced order
with heavy blows of the cudgel;
but, if they thought of that later,
for the time being good people
seemed asleep, which emboldened
the rabble to such a degree they
thought themselves masters of the
situation.
</p>

<p>
You doubtless think our dear
good master, M. le Marquis, was
discouraged at seeing the republic
established in place of his cherished
hopes. Not at all. On the contrary,
he was as ardent and fiery as
ever, assured that it was <q>a necessary
transition</q>&mdash;a phrase which
I repeat as I heard it, without pretending
to explain it, and which,
probably, was profoundly wise.
He was very busy coming and going
with his friends, and arranging
all, in words, for the approaching
arrival of the young legitimate
prince, who remained near the
frontier with a large army, invisible
for the time, but ready to
march at a moment's notice.
</p>

<p>
Jean-Louis and Michou allowed
themselves in secret to be rather
doubtful of these fine assertions,
but, respectful and devoted as they
were to that excellent gentleman,
they made the agreement to follow
him about like his shadow, and to
shield him whenever he might
incur any risk. Thus, whenever
M. le Marquis was seen, near him
was always the handsome, brave
Jeannet, with his pale, serious face,
or the old game-keeper, looking
very jaunty, but with such fierce
eyes and strong arms a man would
think twice before attacking him.
Dear mademoiselle, who was half
dead with fear for her father's life,
confided him entirely to his village
<pb n='192'/><anchor id='Pg192'/>
friends, and begged them every
morning to be faithful to their
trust. Besides, this good soul,
formerly so desirous of seeing and
living in Paris, yawned there almost
as much as at Val-Saint.
</p>

<p>
There was not much amusement
going on in society. Rich people
stayed at home, and guarded their
money, which was carefully concealed
in some secure place, ready
to fly in case of necessity; as for
out-door amusements, none were
thought of. M. le Marquis had
something else to do than drive
out with his daughter; and to circulate
around among the manifestations
was not the most pleasant
performance&mdash;far from it. Poor
mademoiselle seemed doomed to
the miserable fate of always running
after some distraction, <foreign rend='italic'>fêtes</foreign>,
and other disturbances of that
kind, without ever finding them.
Add to all this, she was in a constant
state of fear, as she was little
accustomed to the cries, songs,
patrols, and threats which filled the
capital. Her only consolation was
to hope that there would soon be
an end of all this; and Dame Berthe
encouraged her to be patient,
showing herself all the while full
of the idea of the near triumph of
<hi rend='italic'>the cause</hi>, as she said. And mean-time,
while waiting for it, she embroidered
little strips of white
satin by the dozen, to decorate the
belts of the king's officers when
the triumphal entry would be made
into Paris.
</p>

<p>
Their happiest moment was in
the evening, when these five persons,
drawn together through
friendship and devotion, were reunited
to talk over the events of
the day, and to plan for the next.
M. le Marquis ordered the servants
off to bed&mdash;for they were not sure
but there might be spies among
them&mdash;and, keeping Jeannet and
Michou, he joyfully laid before
them all his plans and hopes.
Jean-Louis listened with one ear;
and fortunate was it that respect
prevented him from joining in the
conversation, as his remarks might
have been very <foreign rend='italic'>malàpropos</foreign>. Can
you guess why? He thought of
other things; and while his master
soared away in imagination to the
frontier, where the invisible army
of the king manœuvred, in heart
and soul he was in the beloved spot,
where he lived over again the happy
days of his childhood.
</p>

<p>
And thus they advanced, without
knowing it, to the terrible days
which gave the death-blow to the
republic, in the midst of the blood
of so many honest men, which flowed
and mingled with that of the
rabble, for love of good order,
which could easily have been established
without so much suffering.
Alas! it was not the first time in our
gay, beautiful France that things
have begun with songs and pleasant
jokes, and ended amid the noise of
cannon and the cries and lamentations
of the wounded.
</p>

<p>
Before relating this last part of
my story, I must tell you that our
<foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign>, always in correspondence
with Jean-Louis, was much astonished
at the uniform coolness of his
letters. At last he thought best
to ask an explanation during the
month of May, advising him to go
and see Solange, who for a long
time had had good news for him.
Do you think it was long before
Jeannet ran quickly to the convent?
When he read that Jeannette loved
him and desired his return, he
nearly became wild with joy. Solange
let him have the precious
letter, which he read and re-read
all one night, so as to be better
able to reply to it. It was time for
<pb n='193'/><anchor id='Pg193'/>
things to change, as Jeannette declined
visibly from the pain she
suffered in believing herself disdained.
</p>

<p>
It is always so with women (I
must make the remark); they torture
without mercy, or at least with
very little thought, the poor hearts
which become attached to them;
and then the day they feel pain in
their turn all must end in the
quickest manner, otherwise they
will die; and then, again, they will
have all the pity and sympathy on
their side. So our two dear children
made up and became friends
with a few words written on paper;
and enchanted were they both, I
can assure you. Now it was easy
to wait. Jean-Louis, in his answer,
showed the same heart, the same
tenderness, as formerly. He wished
no excuses from his sister, saying
that all the fault was on his side&mdash;which
was a big story, as every one
could see but himself, and made
them both laugh and weep at Muiceron.
As for his return, it was
not necessary to promise anything.
They knew well that the day duty
would no longer detain him he
would take the first train and our
good friends, the Ragauds, while
not wishing him to leave M. le Marquis,
commenced to prepare for the
happy moment, so ardently desired
by all.
</p>

<p>
Ragaud told the women it was
not the time for economy, and the
following week he called in the
painters and the masons to replaster
all the house, and to give it an air
of freshness inside, which, I must
acknowledge, was very much needed.
Jeannette directed the changes
in Jean-Louis' room, and I can assure
you she spared nothing, and
spent at least fifty francs of her father's
crowns in a splendid paper
for the walls, which was yellow,
covered with large bouquets of
bright flowers that had the most
beautiful effect. The month of
June found them busily occupied;
and then they began to count, not
the days, but the hours, that would
separate Jean-Louis from the dear
home that had adopted him.
</p>

<p>
His last letter announced his
speedy departure. The joy at
Muiceron, and its holiday look, was
touching to see. Jeannette, pink
and white, like an eglantine rose,
had never looked prettier.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, one morning, M. le
Curé entered the farm, and, in the
midst of all this happiness, pronounced
these terrible words:
</p>

<p>
<q>My children, they are fighting
in Paris, and we must pray to God,
for the danger has never been
greater; happy those who will
come safe out of it!</q>
</p>

</div>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>XXI.</head>

<p>
I shudder when I speak of that
horrible time. Alas! we all know
about the fearful struggle of blood
and tears called <q>The days of
June, 1848.</q>
</p>

<p>
Never did the lowering storm-clouds
more quickly burst, and
never did a great city, in all the pride
of her beauty and wealth, come
nearer complete ruin. Each quarter,
each place, each cross-way,
were battle-fields. Houses were
demolished, that barricades might
be erected across the streets; and
this time, if extravagant accounts
went abroad, not one appeared
exaggerated in face of the real
truth.
</p>

<p>
For three long, weary days&mdash;why,
no one ever knew&mdash;the army kept
hidden; then the sovereign people
were masters of the situation, and
acted as best pleased their capricious
will; and I rather think nobody
but a fool could have helped
<pb n='194'/><anchor id='Pg194'/>
being disgusted with serving such
kings.
</p>

<p>
At the end of these three days, at
last the cry was heard from all the
barracks, <q>Forward!</q> And as in
the time of the great Napoleon,
generals in fine uniforms and waving
plumes dashed about on horseback,
and there was a terrific noise
of cannon and musketry. How
terrible was the anger of the Lord!
For these enemies, who grappled in
the fierce death-struggle, were children
of the same mother, and yet
forgot it in the midst of their senseless
fury and thirst for vengeance,
when, in truth, they had nothing
to avenge.
</p>

<p>
What more shall I tell you?
You know it all better than I; perhaps
you were there; and, besides,
it is not so long ago that you cannot
remember it; and when you recall
it, pray fervently to the good
God such a time may never again
be ours.
</p>

<p>
When the battalions moved,
every honest citizen left his bed,
and armed, to be ready to assist the
army. M. le Marquis was one of
the first on the scene, accompanied
by his two body-guards. Mademoiselle,
when she saw them leave,
wept, and threw herself on her knees
in her room, unwilling to listen to
Dame Berthe, who still could have
the heart to speak of <q>the triumph
of the right,</q> so rooted in her head
was this fixed idea. Leave these
poor women, more to be pitied than
blamed, lamenting and praying to
God, while listening, with hearts
half dead with agony, to the noise
of the battle, and we will see what
became of the combatants.
</p>

<p>
When they left the house, there
was no appearance of extraordinary
excitement, and even the quarter
where M. le Marquis lived, very
quiet at all times, seemed calmer
even than usual, for the very good
reason that, of all who occupied it,
those that were brave ran elsewhere,
and the cowards buried themselves,
like moles, in the cellars. Our
friends first went down one long
street, crossed a second, a third,
and only then, when coming up to
a great bridge with a Prussian
name very difficult to spell&mdash;and
therefore I cannot write it&mdash;began
to see and hear the horrors of the
deadly combat.
</p>

<p>
M. le Marquis stopped.
</p>

<p>
<q>Friends,</q> said he, <q>let us make
the sign of the cross; perhaps one
of us will not return to sleep in his
bed, but may be killed, wounded, or
made prisoner. It is well to provide
ourselves with a passport for
the other world, and one more blessing
for this one.</q>
</p>

<p>
And this excellent gentleman
instantly put in practice what he
preached, pronouncing aloud the
name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come,</q> said he joyously, <q>I
feel younger by ten years. Ah!
while I think of it, have you white
cockades in your pockets?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Faith! no,</q> said Michou; <q>I
confess to M. le Marquis I did not
dream of taking that precaution.
But we need not worry about that;
if we want them, I will tear off an
end of my shirt.</q>
</p>

<p>
Jean-Louis had been equally
forgetful of the white cockades;
M. le Marquis told them their heads
were turned, but forgot to add he
was in the same fix; for they had
rushed to arms in such a hurry,
each one had only taken time to
dress quickly and seize his gun, so
ardently desirous were they to see
the end of the masters of Paris.
</p>

<p>
Soon they were in the midst of
the troops and a crowd of volunteers
like themselves.
</p>

<pb n='195'/><anchor id='Pg195'/>

<p>
The fight was hot. The height
and solidity of the barricades, for
the most part cemented with stone
and mortar like ramparts, forced
them to establish a siege; and the
thick walls that sheltered the rioters
were only destroyed with the aid of
cannon, and after many deaths. I
must be frank, and say it was not a
war very much to the taste of our
soldiers, who like to see the faces
of the enemies at whom they aim;
neither, as a first effort, was it very
amusing for our friend Jeannet, who
had never before seen any fire
but that in the chimney at Muiceron.
So when he found himself in
the midst of the scuffle, surrounded
with dead and wounded, smoke in
his eyes, loud oaths and curses in
his ears, without counting the
whistling of the balls, which I have
been told produces a very droll
effect when not accustomed to it,
he stopped short, and looked so
stupefied Michou laughed at him.
That old soldier had been present
at the battle of Wagram, and, being
very young at the time, was at first
half crazy with fear, which did not
prevent him from showing great
bravery when he recovered his
senses. He therefore understood
from experience precisely how
Jeannet felt, and, giving him a hard
blow on his shoulder, shook the
young fellow's gun, which he was
carelessly pointing at random.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you going to let yourself
be killed like a chicken?</q> he cried
to him, swearing tremendously;
<q>be quick, my boy; you can sleep
to-morrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
Jean-Louis jumped; he drew
himself up to his full height, and
his handsome face reddened with
shame, although he had done nothing
dishonorable.
</p>

<p>
<q>Jacques,</q> said he, <q>I am afraid
I am a coward.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Big mule!</q> gaily cried the
game-keeper; <q>on the contrary, by-and-by
you are going to see how
we will amuse ourselves.</q>
</p>

<p>
They were at the time before a
barricade, which was most obstinately
defended. The conversation
could not last long, but Jacques
Michou did not lose sight of the
boy. He saw that he soon recovered
himself, and kept out of the way
of the balls as well as he could&mdash;something
which required as much
skill as coolness&mdash;and handled his
gun with as firm a hand as though
he were hunting.
</p>

<p>
Fighting went on there for a
good hour. The soldiers began
to be furious, and, notwithstanding
the number of killed on both
sides, no advantage was gained.
Cannon were brought up; at the
first fire, a large breach was effected,
and it was seen that the insurgents
were reduced to a small number,
who attempted to escape.
</p>

<p>
At that sight, the soldiers and
volunteers could not be restrained.
</p>

<p>
<q>No prisoners!</q> cried a hundred
voices, hoarse with rage.
</p>

<p>
That meant death to every one.
Our officers were no longer masters;
the tide, once let loose, soon overflowed,
and a horrible mixture of
shots, cries, and oaths, frightful to
hear, pierced the air.
</p>

<p>
Jeannet became as crazy as the
rest. He fired so often, his gun was
burning in his hands; his dishevelled
hair, and his face, blackened
with powder, changed his appearance
so completely no one would
have recognized him. He loaded
and reloaded, fired at hazard, and
no longer heard Michou, who,
always at his side, cried, <q>Look
out!</q> every moment. Suddenly
the game-keeper gave a yell that
resembled the howl of a wolf. A
man, covered with blood, had just
<pb n='196'/><anchor id='Pg196'/>
leaped upon the ruins of the barricade,
and aimed at Jean-Louis, who
was not three steps from his gun.
</p>

<p>
It is not easy to make you understand
the rapidity with which old
Michou threw himself before Jeannet
to preserve his life. It was
like a flash of lightning, but that
flash sufficed; he had time to fire
before the rioter, who rolled lifeless
on the heaped-up pavement.
</p>

<p>
All was ended. Five minutes
afterwards, at least in that corner,
it only remained to remove the
dead, and carry the wounded into
the neighboring houses, where the
women were ready to dress the
wounds. There was time to
breathe.
</p>

<p>
Alas! the poor, blinded people
paid dearly in that quarter for their
folly and madness. All the unfortunate
wretches who had raised
that barricade were dead or dying.
</p>

<p>
Jacques looked around for his
master and his friend. M. le Marquis,
with his arm all bleeding, was
seated leaning against a post, very
weak and faint from his wound; but
his eyes sparkled, and a smile was
upon his lips. The game-keeper
rushed to him.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is nothing, old fellow,</q> said
our master, <q>only a scratch on the
wrist; lend me your handkerchief.</q>
</p>

<p>
By the mercy of God, it was
really not much; and our dear lord
quietly wrapped up his hand, while
he asked about Jeannet.
</p>

<p>
<q>Heaven has worked miracles
for that child,</q> said Michou proudly.
<q>Ah! he is a brave boy, I tell
you. He fought both like a fox
and a lion!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wish to see him,</q> said M. le
Marquis. <q>Go bring him to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
Jacques willingly obeyed. It
was some time before he found his
pupil&mdash;for such he could be called.
He was in the midst of a crowd
that surrounded him and loaded
him with congratulations and compliments
on his bravery. His conduct
had been noted, and the commanding
officer was then asking
him his name and residence, that
he might inscribe them in his report.
Jeannet, who shrank from
observation, looked like a criminal
before his judges. Michou, seeing
him so timid and confused, told
him he was a fool, and came very
near being angry himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Just see how frightened you are
now!</q> said he to him, in such a
cross tone the officer smiled. <q>Excuse
him, colonel, he always looks
sheepish when before people he
don't know. His name is Jean-Louis
Ragaud, and he comes from
the commune of Val-Saint-sur-Range,
near Issoudun.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All right,</q> said the officer;
<q>that is enough, my brave fellow.
Jean Ragaud, Gen. Cavaignac will
hear of you, ... and, if it depends
on me, you will hear from him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Jeannet bowed as awkwardly as
possible, which made the game-keeper
grumble again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Again I beg of you,</q> said he, <q>to
keep that bewildered stare. You
look like the head of S. John the
Baptist, cut off and laid on a dish,
that is painted in our church. I
suppose it is because you are so unhappy!
The general will no doubt
send after you to have you hanged&mdash;unless
he sends you the Cross of
the Legion of Honor....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The cross!</q> cried Jeannet,
seizing the game-keeper by the
arm.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes indeed, idiot! I know how
soldiers talk; would the colonel
have said as much unless he was
sure of the fact?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The cross!</q> repeated Jean-Louis,
with tears in his eyes. <q>O
Jacques Michou! if it were true!</q>
</p>

<pb n='197'/><anchor id='Pg197'/>

<p>
<q>That would make you bold, eh?
And it would be a fine present to
take back to Muiceron.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hush!</q> said Jeannet: <q>the bare
thought makes me crazy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I hope not,</q> replied Michou;
<q>but I would be half wild myself.
Come, now, let us be off; we have
earned our dinner. M. le Marquis
is asking for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait a moment, good, kind
Jacques,</q> said Jean-Louis. <q>I have
not yet thanked you; and yet I
know you saved my life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What nonsense!</q> said Michou,
who in his turn looked embarrassed.
<q>In such a battle, do you think
a fellow looks after any one's skin
but his own?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! I saw you,</q> replied Jeannet.
<q>You sprang before me, or I
would have been killed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen,</q> said Michou in a solemn
tone, <q>before God, who hears
me, and conducts all by his divine
hand, it was not so much your life
that I wished to save, ... it was
another's that I wished to take.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We should not love revenge,</q>
replied the game-keeper; <q>but the
temptation was too strong; faith!
I am ready to confess it, if it was a
sin&mdash;of which I am not sure. Jeannet,
he who aimed at you from the
barricade&mdash;didn't you recognize
him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No,</q> said Jeannet, <q>I saw no
one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was Isidore Perdreau. God
have mercy on his soul!</q> said
the game-keeper, blessing himself.
<q>My poor Barbette in heaven will
ask for my pardon....</q>

<p>
Words the most familiar, and
which convey to the mind the most
clearly marked associations of
ideas, very frequently grow vague
and obscure when we seek to limit
their meaning by accurate and
scientific definitions. When we attempt
to define that which is complex,
or to make a generalization of
facts of diverse natures, we find it
extremely difficult to avoid including
more than we intend, or leaving
out something that should be embraced.
</p>

<p>
This will become evident to any
one who will take the trouble, for
instance, to examine into the various
definitions of life which have
been given by philosophers and
scientists.<note place='foot'><p>S. Thomas says (<hi rend='italic'>Summa Contra Gentiles</hi>,
l. 4, c. xi.): <q>Nam viventia sunt quæ seipsa movent
ad agendum; illa vero quæ non nisi exteriora
movere possunt omnino sunt vita carentia.</q>
This, however, is rather a description of a vital
phenomenon than a definition of life itself. Fichte
says: <q>Life is the tendency to individuation;</q>
which, like most of the phrases of the German
pantheists, means nothing or anything you
please.
</p>
<p>
According to Richerand, <q>Life is a collection
of phenomena which succeed each other during a
limited time in an organized body</q>; but this
applies equally to the succession of phenomena
which takes place in the body after death. Herbert
Spencer defines life to be <q>the co-ordination
of actions</q>; but what is anything but a co-ordination
of acting forces, consequently of actions?
This definition is as applicable to sulphuric acid
as to life.</p></note> Still, they all agree,
however widely they may differ in
their views concerning what life is
in itself, that the law of growth applies
to all living beings. This is
true, not of physical life alone, but
of intellectual and moral life as
well. What I have to say on this
subject at present relates more
especially to intellectual life, which
consists in the union of the intelligent
principle with the objects submitted
to it, and which it apprehends
as true&mdash;that is, as being in
reality what they seem to be, and
resulting from this, as good or
beautiful.
</p>

<p>
Truth is the harmony of thought
with things.<note place='foot'>Kant defined truth to be the harmony of
thought with thought, not of thought with
things.</note> Intellectual growth
is a continual approach to the perfect
harmony of thought with things,
which, however, to the finite mind,
is unattainable; and this fact constitutes
one of the great charms of
the cultivation of the mind.
</p>

<p>
The nature of the human intellect
places limits to mental progress,
though they are not assignable
in any given case, but may be
indefinitely extended. That there
are limits, however, you will readily
perceive by reflecting that we do
not possess even one idea which does
not, either in itself or in its postulates,
contain something which
transcends all human comprehension.
</p>

<p>
What, let us ask ourselves, is
the law of intellectual growth?
The condition of all growth is effort.
Life is a struggle in which
lesser forces are overcome by greater.
This is true of the individual
as of the race. It is only by effort,
by the exertion of power, that
we live and consequently grow.
Labor, then, is the law of intellectual
as of all progress.
</p>

<p>
Before going further, let us examine
<pb n='199'/><anchor id='Pg199'/>
into the obstacles which tend
to prevent improvement of mind.
</p>

<p>
These are to be sought for either
in the circumstances which surround
us or in ourselves. We are
to such an extent the creatures of
circumstances that, when these are
unfavorable, it is almost impossible
that we should make great head-way.
</p>

<p>
As occasion makes the thief, it is
also required to make the scholar.
In the first place, leisure is essential
to mental culture, since education
is a work of time and of labor. We
therefore look for little or no cultivation
of mind in those who lead
lives of manual toil, and who, during
the brief moments allowed for recreation,
are so fatigued as to be incapable
of sustained mental effort.
</p>

<p>
Here and there an individual
from this class, of remarkable gifts,
and endowed with great energy and
will, surmounts the obstacle, and,
having risen to a higher level, succeeds,
by perseverance and industry,
in making very considerable intellectual
progress. But, as a rule, all
will admit that it would be absurd
to look for much mental training in
men who work ten or even eight
hours a day in factories and mines,
or in tilling the soil.
</p>

<p>
Intercourse with educated men is
of the greatest advantage in the
work of self-education; and where
this is wanting, intellectual progress
will rarely be found. The presence
of highly developed and gifted
minds has a magnetic power which
creates emulation, awakens admiration,
and stimulates to effort. Hence
we find the great men of the world,
whether philosophers, poets, statesmen,
orators, or artists, in schools
and historic groups.
</p>

<p>
Books, too, are required; but to
this part of the subject we shall
return.
</p>

<p>
The obstacles to mental growth
within ourselves are of various
kinds. Some have their origin in
the body, some in the intellect,
others in the will.
</p>

<p>
Infirm health, the love of ease,
and excessive fondness of eating
and drinking are generally incompatible
with intellectual growth;
and yet some of the greatest minds
have wrought through feeble bodies,
whilst many literary men have
indulged to excess in the pleasures
of the table, though always to their
own injury.
</p>

<p>
The literary man, it may be well
to remark, is not necessarily the
thoroughly educated man; very
often, indeed, he has nothing of the
true man except the talent for
letters. Vain, selfish, conceited,
restless, a fickle friend, an unfaithful
husband, the mere man of
letters, poet, novelist, or scribe, is
too often a caricature on human
nature.
</p>

<p>
There are in the mind itself
obstacles to mental progress which
vary with the peculiarities of the
individual. There are weak minds,
slow minds, inattentive minds; in
fact, all minds are in different degrees
subject to these defects, and
it is only relatively and by comparison
that some are said to be
feeble, whilst others are strong.
Education supposes these weaknesses,
and it is its aim to correct
them. Obstacles to intellectual
growth may exist also in the will;
since the mind, under the influence
of inordinate passion, is incapable
of the deliberation and sustained
attention which are required for
calm and serious thought.
</p>

<p>
These, briefly and imperfectly
stated, are, it seems to me, the
chief difficulties with which those
who seek to improve their minds
have to contend.
</p>

<pb n='200'/><anchor id='Pg200'/>

<p>
They are not imaginary, but they
are not so great as to frighten men
in your condition of life. For you,
young gentlemen, the obstacles of
circumstance do not, I may say,
exist. Your occupations leave you
a few hours out of the twenty-four,
which you are free to devote to
study; you may enjoy, if such be
your desire, the conversation of
men of thought and learning, whilst
books of all kinds are within your
reach. I may add that, in a great
metropolis like this, you possess
special advantages. Here you
have the best of everything. Where
there is the greatest demand for
the most perfect, thither will it
gravitate by a law as universal as
that of attraction. To this city,
from two worlds, come the best
orators, the most learned men of
science, the finest singers, the most
accomplished actors, for the same
reason that the fattest beeves, the
choicest wines, and the most costly
fabrics are sent hither&mdash;that is, because
there is a demand for them.
On the other hand, life in great
cities has its intellectual dangers.
There is here so much of the mere
noise of life that most men find it
difficult to dwell within themselves,
to receive as welcome guests
thoughts that do not concern the
business or the pleasure of the
hour&mdash;difficult not to be drawn into
the whirlpool of human passion,
where men eddy round and round,
shouting, rushing, struggling, in
wild confusion, forgetful of themselves,
forgetful of truth. In a
great commercial centre, too, we are
apt to become the victims of the
prevailing opinion which attaches
honor and respect to wealth before
all things; and I know of nothing
more hurtful to intellectual growth
than the absorbing pursuit of riches
or that narrow disposition of soul
which causes men to fawn upon the
rich, even though they have nothing
but money. That it is of importance
to every one to think correctly,
to possess a trained and cultivated
mind, I need not attempt to
prove. The harmonious development
of our faculties in accordance
with the principles of eternal wisdom
is, I may say, the great work of
life; for the proper training of the
intellect necessarily involves the
cultivation of the moral faculties.
Of the necessity and priceless
value of such education there can
be no diversity of opinion among
enlightened, men. Nor wealth nor
place can give to man the dignity
which is derived from the perfection
of his own powers. We are
greater than whatever ministers to
our wants and vanities.
</p>

<p>
Another consideration which
you will permit me to present to
your attention, as suggestive of
salutary thought in connection
with the benefits to be derived
through an association like yours,
is this: no man who has done
nothing more than go through a
college course, it matters not how
brilliant he may have been, can
rightly be called educated. Education
is the work of the man, and
not of the boy. The best that
school-training can do is to teach
the boy how he should study when
he has become a man. Though
there will generally be found a
certain refinement, correctness of
expression, and intelligent appreciativeness
in those who have made
a collegiate course, yet, if this be
not followed up by the study of the
man, they will be found to possess
neither mental strength nor logical
accuracy.
</p>

<p>
Before entering upon the direct
treatment of the proper method to
be pursued by those who seek to
<pb n='201'/><anchor id='Pg201'/>
improve their minds, allow me to
say a word of the work of preparation,
which is twofold, intellectual
and moral.
</p>

<p>
We should prepare the mind for
the reception of truth by freeing
it from all those opinions which
rest upon no other foundation than
prejudice. There are personal prejudices,
family prejudices, national
prejudices, prejudices of childhood,
prejudices of old age, prejudices
of men, prejudices of women, all
of which tend to prevent the view
of things as they are in themselves,
by directing the mind, in an undue
manner, to their relations to ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Personal prejudice inclines each
one to think too well of himself,
his talents, his acquirements; it is
that, in a word, which makes it
almost impossible that any power
should

<p>
It is the great obstacle to self-knowledge
and the fruitful source
of error, warping the judgment
and perverting the will. It creates
within us a tendency to deceive
ourselves concerning whatever we
love or hate.
</p>

<p>
National prejudice is another
very common phase of this universal
weakness. How few men
are capable of forming just and
fair opinions of the manners, customs,
and opinions of foreign nations!
The infirmity of even great
minds is, in this respect, lamentable;
above all, this is an original sin of
the English people; for they&mdash;if I
be not myself under the influence
of the prejudice which I condemn&mdash;are
the most narrow and insular, in
their self-conceit, of all the peoples
of the earth. It is next to miraculous
that an Englishman should
judge fairly of the Irish, the
French, the Italians, or the Americans;
and this unfortunate defect
of the national mind has been
stamped upon the literature of the
country.<note place='foot'><p>It may be well to quote the testimony of two
Englishmen on this subject.
</p>
<p>
Buckle, in his <hi rend='italic'>History of Civilization</hi>, vol. i.
page 158, says: <q>Thus, for instance, the miserable
and impudent falsehoods which a large
class of English writers formerly directed against
the morals and private character of the French
and&mdash;to their shame be it said&mdash;even against the
chastity of Frenchwomen, tended not a little to
embitter the angry feelings then existing between
the two first countries of Europe: irritating the
English against French vices, irritating the
French against English calumnies. In the same
way, there was a time when every honest Englishman
firmly believed that he could beat ten
Frenchmen&mdash;a class of beings whom he held in
sovereign contempt, as a lean and stunted race,
who drank claret instead of brandy, who lived
entirely off frogs; miserable infidels, who heard
Mass every Sunday, who bowed down before
idols, and who even worshipped the Pope.</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>I did not know,</q> says John Stuart Mill, in
his <hi rend='italic'>Autobiography</hi>, <q>the way in which, among
the ordinary English, the absence of interest in
things of an unselfish kind, except occasionally
in a special thing here and there, and the habit
of not speaking to others, nor much even to
themselves, about the things in which they do
feel interest, cause both their feelings and their
intellectual faculties to remain undeveloped, or
to develop themselves only in some single and
very limited direction, reducing them, considered
as spiritual beings, to a kind of negative existence.</q></p></note>
</p>

<p>
Americans, more, probably, from
the force of circumstances which
were not under their control than
from any other cause, are less narrow
in their nationalism, though
by no means free from prejudice.
In the past, at least, we were too
often guilty of the folly of looking
upon our form of government as
ideal, forgetting that no form of
government should be considered
in the abstract, or as good or better,
except relatively to the circumstances
to which it is applied.
</p>

<p>
Then, we, a young people, affect
contempt for antiquity, and become
superficial, and lose veneration.
</p>

<p>
It is not necessary that I should
enter further into this part of the
subject.
</p>

<p>
There is, I have said, a work of
<pb n='202'/><anchor id='Pg202'/>
preparation which directly concerns
the moral nature. As the
mind is to be freed from prejudice,
the will is to be taken from beneath
the yoke of passion. It is
through the will that the intellect
is warped by prejudice. He who
is the slave of passion will rarely
have an honest desire to improve
his mind; and, even where this exists,
the tyrant into whose hands
he has surrendered his soul will
deprive him of the power. Sensual
indulgence produces a deterioration
of the nervous system, which,
of course, causes a corresponding
degeneracy in the intellectual faculties.
How can there be a love
of excellence without self-respect,
and how can a man who habitually
violates the sanctity of his nature
respect himself?
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing,</q> says Cicero, <q>is so
injurious, so baneful, as lust, which,
were it stronger or of greater duration,
would extinguish the very
light of reason. It prevents thought,
blindfolds the eyes of the mind, and
can have no society with wisdom.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will simply express my strong
belief,</q> says Faraday, one of the
greatest men of science of this
century, <q>that that point of self-education
which consists in teaching
the mind to resist its desires
and inclinations until they are
proved to be right, is the most important
of all, not only in things
of natural philosophy, but in every
department of daily life.</q>
</p>

<p>
The assent of the mind is, in a
marvellous manner, subject to the
power of the will. How readily
we give credence to what flatters
our vanity, or is, from whatever
cause, agreeable to us!
</p>

<p>
We easily persuade a man that
what he wishes to do is right, but
usually labor in vain when passion
pleads against us.
</p>

<p>
In this undoubted psychological
fact is found the hidden cause of
the infidelity of many young men.
They do wrong, and passion seeks
to justify their conduct to their intelligence,
which becomes the tool
of the perverted will.
</p>

<p>
Or, if you prefer to take another
view of the subject, I will say that
what the French call <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>l'interiorité</foreign>&mdash;the
habitual dwelling with one's own
thoughts&mdash;is an essential condition
of mental growth. But this is painful
to the sensual man, who has
violated the sanctuary of his soul,
and can consequently no longer
dwell there in peace.
</p>

<p>
What pleasure can the father find
in the bosom of his family, when he
has betrayed the wife whom he
swore to love, and has brought
shame upon the name which his
children have received from him?
</p>

<p>
To him, then, who wishes to begin
the life-work of self-improvement
I would say: Seek to have a
large mind, from which no narrowing
prejudice shuts out the full
light of truth; have a pure heart,
with the strength to love all that is
right.
</p>

<p>
Then, I ask of him the will to
work and to persevere in labor.
Labor is the great law of progress,
the necessary condition of all improvement.
He who wishes to be
an educated man must have courage;
he must consent to see himself
forgotten for a time, overshadowed
by the easy-won reputations
of those of his own age, who will
wear their honors full-blushing,
whilst all his life is still concentred
in the bud that wraps it close and
nurtures it.
</p>

<p>
Is it easy, in the fresh-blown flower
of manhood, in the enthusiasm of a
newly-found liberty, when fair hands
hold out the cup of pleasure, when
bright eyes and smiling lips woo
<pb n='203'/><anchor id='Pg203'/>
to indulgence&mdash;is it easy, then, to
choose rather silence and solitude,
a life of toil more earnest and not
less regular than the enforced labor
of the college? And yet this must
be. There is no royal road to
science.

<p>
I have heard the question&mdash;you
have asked it yourselves&mdash;Where are
the young men who go forth year
after year from our colleges? What
becomes of them? We never hear
of them. Is not something wrong?
They cease to study, they cease to
grow, and are lost in the crowd.
</p>

<p>
But your presence, young gentlemen,
assures me that you have not
ceased to labor, and that you do
not intend to cease to grow.
</p>

<p>
Permit me, then, to present to you
a few suggestions concerning the
proper method of study. We do
nothing well except what we do
with system and order. Set apart,
therefore, stated times for the improvement
of your minds, and suffer
not a slight circumstance to interfere
with this arrangement. And
now I feel that I must be brief,
when the subject which I am treating
most requires development.
How to study and what to study
are problems which engage the attention
of the profoundest thinkers
of our age, the adequate solution
of which can be found only in a
perfect philosophy of education,
which possibly has not yet been
written. Without aiming, then, to
be either deep or thorough, I shall
strive to be practical. To study, as
I have already intimated, means to
work with the mind. The mind
grows by union with truth, by the
assimilation of knowledge, which
never takes place except by direct
application of the thinking subject
to the object thought. This continued
application&mdash;in other words,
attention&mdash;is difficult; it wearies
the mind, it fatigues the body. To
read is not to study. Some of
the most indolent men I have ever
known, intellectually indolent, were
passionately fond of reading. To
read requires no mental effort, and
demands merely that sort of attention
necessary to form a vague notion
of each sentence as it passes
through the mind. A man may
read all the books in the Astor
Library, and acquire hardly more
knowledge than there will remain
water in a sieve through which a
stream has been pouring. Indiscriminate,
inattentive reading confuses
the mind, and, if persevered
in, begets a mental habit incompatible
with clear and accurate thinking;
and the important thing, from
an educational point of view, is not
so much to get knowledge as to
strengthen and develop the intellect,
that it may be prepared to
grapple intelligently and successfully
with the problems which greatly
concern or interest us as rational
beings.
</p>

<p>
But you will readily understand
that it is far from my thought to
wish to dissuade you from cultivating
a fondness for reading. On
the contrary, this, if you have
it not, you must acquire, if you
hope to make progress in the work
of self-education. Read, then, but
read intelligently, thoughtfully. One
should read at his writing-desk,
pen in hand, taking note of new
and striking thoughts, of graceful
and forcible modes of expression;
bringing the author's ideas into the
presence of higher truths, of principles
that are fixed; rejecting what
is false, assimilating what is just.
Better still, write yourselves. Do
not imagine that I have the faintest
<pb n='204'/><anchor id='Pg204'/>
desire to encourage you to become
authors; there would be fewer
and better authors if men were
in the habit of doing what I would
have you do. Write, not that
others may read your thoughts,
but that they may become clear to
your own minds.
</p>

<p>
<q>I confess,</q> said S. Augustine,
<q>that by writing I have learned
many things which nothing else
had taught me.</q> You will recall
to mind the apothegm of Bacon:
<q>Reading makes a full man, talking
a ready man, and writing an exact
man.</q>
</p>

<p>
I have no hesitation in saying
that, of all means of mental culture,
writing is the best, as well for extending
and deepening the intellectual
faculties, as for giving them
justness and polish.
</p>

<p>
Do I propose to you to go back
to the drudgery of task compositions?
Such is not my thought.
</p>

<p>
I suppose you to be interested in
certain subjects, of which you wish
to get at least a tolerably thorough
knowledge. You take the authors
who have treated most exhaustively
of these matters; you read them,
you study them; you apply your
own minds, in sustained thought,
to the facts and principles which
they give you. And here precisely
lies the difficulty; for you will find
that, when you will have acquired
the power of sustained thought, you
will be able to master almost any
subject.
</p>

<p>
Now, to get this mental habit,
nothing will aid you like writing.
I do not believe that any man who
has never translated his thoughts
into written language is able to
think profoundly or correctly. Do
not, however, misunderstand me.
One may write negligently and
thoughtlessly, as he may read with
indolence and inattention. Put
your hand to the pen, and begin to
meditate upon the thoughts that
fill your mind. Should you, for
weeks and months, not write one
sentence for every hour you hold
the pen, do not be discouraged, and,
above all, be persuaded that this
time has not been lost. Think
neither of style nor of the reader;
give all your attention to truth and
to your own soul. The style is
the man. Write out the life that is
within you. Keep what you have
written, and after months and years,
in looking back, you will perceive
that you have grown steadily, increased
day by day in intellectual
vigor and refinement; and there
will always be special worth in
words written, not to please the
vulgar crowd, not to propitiate a
false and intolerant public opinion&mdash;written
to gain neither applause
nor gold, but for God and truth,
and the dignity of the human soul.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is nothing,</q> says Seneca,
<q>however difficult or arduous,
which the human mind cannot
conquer, and assiduous meditation
render familiar. Whatever the soul
demands of itself it obtains.</q> But
how are you to learn the secret of
assiduous meditation, to acquire the
habit of retaining difficulties in
mind, to be considered and reconsidered,
to be taken up at the leisure
moment, and laid down as deferred
but not abandoned?
</p>

<p>
As the soldier takes the sword,
the painter the brush, the musician
his instrument, the mechanic the
tools of his trade, each to perfect
himself in his art, so he who wishes
to learn how to think must take the
pen and do honest work.

<p>
I shall conclude this part of my
<pb n='205'/><anchor id='Pg205'/>
subject with a quotation from Sir
William Hamilton: <q>The primary
principle of education is the determination
of the pupil to self-activity&mdash;the
doing nothing for him which
he is able to do for himself.</q> This
principle is applicable to every
stage of the mind's development,
and in it will be found the secret
of success in the great work of self-education.
</p>

<p>
The student, I have said, should
cultivate a fondness for intelligent
and thoughtful reading; for in
books chiefly all human knowledge
is treasured up.
</p>

<p>
<q>Many a man lives a burden to
the earth,</q> says Milton; <q>but a
good book is the precious life-blood
of a master-spirit, embalmed and
treasured up on purpose to a life
beyond life.</q> But only a few
books are good. The great mass
of those that are written fall upon
the world dead, or at best survive
but a short time.
</p>

<p>
We are about to celebrate the centennial
anniversary of our national
existence, and, in the hundred
years of our life, we have made
many books. How many of them
will be read in the next century?
A dozen? Hardly.
</p>

<p>
There is the Augustan age, the
age of Leo X., the Elizabethan age,
the age of Louis XIV., the age of
Queen Anne, all remarkable for
literary excellence and the number
of great writers whom they produced,
and yet you can count on your
fingers the really good books that
each has bequeathed to us. And
this, too, is worthy of remark: a
considerable portion of the books
that survive are saved by style
alone, and not on account of more
solid worth. Books which have
the inductive sciences as their object
can, from the nature of things,
live but a short time, since these
sciences, being in a state of continuous
development are constantly
outgrowing their own conclusions,
and the treatises of even the ablest
observers are superseded by those
of men who, with less genius, have
more certain and numerous data.
</p>

<p>
Works of imagination, poetry
and romance, may meet with temporary
success, without possessing
the higher qualities, from the fact
that they describe a mental, moral,
or social phase of existence whose
chief interest lies in its actuality.
When this is past, the literary efforts
called forth by it die. In
fiction, only the very best is worthy
of study.

And here is a case in point, in
which we should know how to rise
above prejudice&mdash;the vulgar prejudice
of the insipid and intellectually

which it is considered the proper

each worthless production that happens
to have a run.

<p>
Persons of intellectual aspirations
should, as far as possible, associate
with their superiors in knowledge
and elevation of thought, and should
exclude the common herd from intellectual
companionship.
</p>

<p>
There is at least an aristocracy
of mind, to which neither gold nor
title can give admission, but only
kinship of spirit, smitten with the
love of high thinking. What Tennyson
has written of a different union

<p>
Allow me, in this connection, to
<pb n='206'/><anchor id='Pg206'/>
say a word of periodical literature.
</p>

<p>
A book can wait for success; the
best books have not been understood
by the generation for which
they were written; but a newspaper
or magazine must succeed at once,
or fail utterly, since its life is necessarily
ephemeral. Hence the great
probability is that it will be guided,
not by principle, but by policy;
that it will aim, not to uphold truth,
but to flatter the prejudices of its
readers. If it is the organ of a party,
it must defend its interests blindly;
and hence, whenever argument is
attempted, it will be found to consist
of little else than special pleading
and sophistry. But since the
average newspaper-reader is not
fond of logic, the partisan organ
will deal rather with men than with
principles; and the whole basis of
this procedure is double-dealing&mdash;untruth
erected into the dignity of
a principle. Its business will be to
whitewash its friends, and besmear
its enemies. When its party is out
of office, it will swell with indignation
at the public corruption, and
will use what are called the argus
eyes of the press to discover things
which do not exist; but when the
spoils are in the hands of its friends,
it will devote itself to covering up
their misdeeds. There is also what is
called the independent press, which
generally has less of principle than
that which is avowedly partisan.
It in turn affirms and denies everything,
plays fast and loose, palters
in a double sense, and, with a seeming
honesty, is most unfair, lending
all its influence to persuade
men that there is no such thing
as truth, and that morality is only
cant.
</p>

<p>
There are yet other heads of indictment
that may be brought,
without injustice, against the press.
Its columns are filled with details,
more or less minute, of all the horrible
and disgusting crimes which
disgrace society, with sins against
the decencies of life, with coarse
personalities, and advertisements
which are an opprobrium to human
nature.
</p>

<p>
This, I must confess, is a one-sided
view of the question; it is,
however, the view which my subject
forces me to take in treating
of the means of self-education.
</p>

<p>
Though it would be absurd to
ask you not to read newspapers, it
would, in my opinion, be wholly
unwise to counsel you to make use
of them to any great extent as
aids to true cultivation of mind.
We grow, morally and intellectually,
by association with that which is
above us, and not by contact with
what is low; and it is not by filling
the mind day by day with what is
startling, corrupt, sensational, or at
best only of passing interest, but
by lifting it up into the higher and
serener atmosphere, from which
the trivial and transitory value of
these things is perceived, that it
will gain in depth and power.
</p>

<p>
Except in the line of study
which belongs to one's profession,
the wisest rule is to confine ourselves
to the works of really great
minds, which we should not merely
read, but study.
</p>

<p>
In connection with practical self-education,
I consider the <q>conversation
evening,</q> as described in
your <hi rend='italic'>Report</hi> for 1872, excellent.
In intellectual pursuits, as in other
things, association gives increase of
power and the means of progress.
The contact of mind with mind
develops the latent fire, and strikes
into life the slumbering thought.
Mind becomes supplementary to
mind; and the intercommunion of
souls, which constitutes the purest
<pb n='207'/><anchor id='Pg207'/>
friendship, becomes also the source
of the highest pleasure.
</p>

<p>
I know that the value of mere
intellectual cultivation may be exaggerated,
and that, in point of
fact, the men who, in our day,
deny God, insist most upon the
developed mind's self-sufficiency.
</p>

<p>
<q>In the writings of our great
poets,</q> says Strauss, after having
rejected God and the soul, <q>in the
performances of our great musicians,
we find a satisfying stimulus
for the intellect and the heart,
and for fancy in her deepest or
most sportive moods.</q><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>The Old Faith and the New</hi>, p. 120.</note>
</p>

<p>
Indeed, there is a danger in polite
education which we should be
most careful to avoid. The love
of poetry and music, of the fine
arts in general, has, I think, a tendency
to make us unreal and visionary,
because it separates feeling
from acting. We may have high
thoughts, fine sentiments, and pleasurable
emotions, and yet lie slothfully
on our couch. But life is for
action, and to this end thought,
sentiment, and feeling should all
conspire. If science and philosophy
be our favorite pursuits, we
may acquire inveterate habits of
analysis which, by drying up the
fountains of feeling, and isolating the
intellect from the heart, will convert
the mind into a storehouse
for abstractions and lifeless formulas.
This tendency of the study
of science will give us a satisfactory
explanation of many of the
intellectual errors of the present
day.
</p>

<p>
From abstraction, only the abstract,
the unreal, can be inferred,
and hence the new philosophy of
atheism does not affirm being, but
merely the phenomenon.
</p>

<p>
The exaggerated importance
which this age has attributed to mere
intellectual cultivation has, amongst
other results, produced what may
be called over-education&mdash;an excessive
activity of brain, which
threatens to enfeeble the physical
health of modern peoples by abnormally
developing the nervous
system.
</p>

<p>
I have referred to these dangers,
not for the purpose of insisting on
them, but rather that I might have
an opportunity to say that they are
not to be greatly dreaded by us.
The church gives us fixed principles
of faith, certain rules of conduct,
which will prevent the love of
literature from taking from us that
deep and practical seriousness of
mind which is inseparable from
the true Christian character, whilst
she guides us with an eye that sees
the light of heaven through the
dark mazes of philosophy; and the
fear of over-education should certainly
not trouble us.
</p>

<p>
The educated Catholics of this
country seem to be fast sinking to
a low level of mediocrity, above
which no man has the power or the
courage to raise his head. Where
are the men, lay or clerical, who
give promise of becoming worthy
to be the successors of Kenrick, of
England, of Hughes, or of Brownson?
</p>

<p>
And yet never was there an age
or country in which men of might,
able to do battle for the truth, were
more needed. If we sink out of
the intellectual life of the American
people, we shall be passed by and
forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Permit me, then, young gentlemen,
before concluding this hastily-written
address, to exhort you to be
ambitious, not of success, but of
excellence, which is its own reward.
He who is worthy to succeed can
despise success. After the noble
<pb n='208'/><anchor id='Pg208'/>
resolve to be true to God, to one's
self, and to one's fellowman, I know
of no higher aim in life than to
grow in intellectual strength.
</p>

<p>
Older men than you might say
that my words smack something too
much of the savor of youth, which
is <q>a bubble blown up with breath,
whose wit is weakness.</q> But with
you, enthusiasm, I am sure, need
not plead for pardon. Even to
have dreamed of deeds of high
emprise and noble endeavor, of
victories won on the foughten field,
is something; and to the young
should belong hope, which is not
only the charm of life, but also its
strength.
</p>

<p>
Without the living hope of something
better, man falls back upon
himself, in impotence, like a bird
whose wing is clipt. He who
wishes to do much must hope for
still more.
</p>

<p>
Hope gives the conviction of
strength; it is confidence, and confidence
is power. Have faith and
hope in God and in yourselves;
and, above all, believe that the
highest wisdom consists in tender
love for the religion of Jesus Christ.
Guard yourselves against a life of
indulgence, which is incompatible
with generous ambition and is destructive
of character. Yield not to
the fascinations of a literature which
flatters human weakness and pays
court to the senses instead of
speaking to the soul. Be not cynical,
be large-hearted, since the
true view is the generous view.
Give the homage of admiration to
every great man, whether he be a
hero, a genius, or a saint.
</p>

<p>
When you see Napoleon on the
battle-field, and look into his eye,
and behold there the soul of the
war-god that looks and conquers,
forget for the moment his tyranny
and selfishness, and let your soul
shout unto his presence a shout of
living enthusiasm, even as the war-cry
of his own unconquered veterans
when, in the battle, he rode amongst
them in strength and majesty, like
unto the archangel when he beat
into hell the rebellious powers of
heaven. When you stand in the
Roman forum, and see Cicero arise
and take into his hands the enchained
hearts of his hearers, and play
upon them, as the harper sweeps
his fingers over the trembling
chords of the lyre, till it shouts
or laughs or wails, sighs like the
zephyr, sings like the seraph, curses
like the demon, let your soul also
be attuned to the thrilling accents
of his divine eloquence.
</p>

<p>
When you behold young Xavier,
surrounded by the most brilliant
audience that fame could attract,
suddenly, after a burst of applause,
stop, reflect a moment, then quit
that scene of triumph, and, clothed
in simple garb, turn his eager steps
toward the East, where millions
dwell who have never heard the
name of Jesus, and there, strong in
the power of divine love and super-human
self-sacrifice, cause every
knee to bend to Jesus and every
tongue to bless his holy name, until
at last, still seeking for some soul in
darkness lying, on a barren isle,
far from man or beast, alone, with
the ocean before him, the desert
around him, and God within him,
he breathes out his great soul in
the words of a confidence certain
of itself: <q>In thee, O God! have
I hoped; I shall not be confounded
for ever</q>&mdash;when you behold all
this, lift up your hearts to God, and
ask him to give you, too, the strength
to be Christians.

It is true indeed that he does
eat, the prince of the ancient name,
and exquisitely beautiful little
town, of Monaco. But it is food
that would give an indigestion to
any man with a conscience. The
prince has reserved to himself of
his lovely tiny principality very
little more than his large palace
and the surrounding gardens. The
rest is let to the keeper of a gambling
establishment built and organized
on a very magnificent scale,
and standing, with its hotel and
several gay shops, in the most exquisite
Italian gardens that imagination
can picture&mdash;veritable gardens
of Armida, with terrace above
terrace, flights of white, gleaming
steps, handsome balustrades, and
all the glorious flowers and foliage
of far-distant and still more sunny
regions. They command a view
of unspeakable beauty. They are
full of all the sweet, peaceful suggestions
of lovely nature, heightened
and enhanced by the order and
arrangement of subtle art. As I
wandered up and down the marble
stairs, and from beneath the shade
of eucalyptus, palm, mimosa, tamarisk,
and cypress, into the sunny
walks bright with flowers, my heart
sank within me at the dreadful
thought that all this had been
brought together for no other purpose
than to minister to human
passions of the worst kind, and to
accumulate sordid gains by trading
on vice. Games of chance may
not, in themselves, be wrong. Far
be it from me to assert that they
are. But if the chronicles of Monaco
could be truly written for only
one season, we should look on this
beautiful scene, where God's best
gifts in bountiful nature have been
used to decorate and adorn it to
the utmost, as simply one of the
gates of hell, and probably one of
its broadest and largest. The moon
was riding through a pure expanse
of spotless blue, her reflection dancing
on the rippling sea with silver
footsteps, as we passed down the
flights of broad stairs from terrace
to terrace to join the night-train to
Mentone. The journey took us
barely twenty minutes; and we
were silent and depressed. We had
seen no startling sight: all was
perfectly decorous and calm. A
slight click, click, very occasionally,
as the heaps of gold had been piled
on the <foreign rend='italic'>tapis vert</foreign>, and a subdued,
muffled noise, hardly perceptible, as
the croupiers dragged forward the
gains and the losses of silent figures
that sat or stood around the numerous
gambling-tables&mdash;that was all.
Hours passed. People came and
went with noiseless tread and controlled
countenance. No man committed
<pb n='210'/><anchor id='Pg210'/>
suicide in our presence.
No woman shrieked at her loss or
laughed at her success. Outwardly,
it was calm, silent, and intense.
But there is a wordless language
which speaks from one human soul
to another, and which, whether we
will or no, reveals something of
the inner state and the unspoken
secrets. The very air teemed with
these secrets. And as I passed out
into the quiet night, I wondered
whether perhaps in hell there will
be the same decorous silence, without
the exterior beauty, and all
the fire of anguish be hidden beneath
the outer garb&mdash;so entirely
did it seem that, to many, it might
be but one step from <emph>this</emph> to <emph>that</emph>.

The rusticity of Mentone was a
relief after the sort of nightmare
to which we had so needlessly subjected
ourselves at Monaco. It
was carnival time, and the peasantry
were making merry. A motley
crew came pouring down the
only street worthy of the name,
in fantastic dresses, making hideous
sounds through huge horns,
shouting and dancing. They had
two bears with them, which, I afterwards
heard, in their frolic they
had let loose, to the alarm of quiet
folks. For myself, I scrambled up
a steep, narrow, and very dirty
<foreign rend='italic'>vicolo</foreign>,<note place='foot'>A street-lane.</note> part of which was composed
of broken steps, glad to be
out of their way. And so, climbing
higher and higher, I found myself
at the parish church, where
there was an Exposition of the Blessed
Sacrament, and where the noise
of the masks and merry-makers
could not penetrate.
</p>

<p>
As I am far from intending to
give my kind readers anything of the
nature of a guide-book&mdash;a task for
which I am utterly unqualified&mdash;I
will not weary them with an account
of how and by what route we found
ourselves at the San Marco Hotel
at Bologna, the City of Arcades, the
capital of jurisprudence, whence
came many an astute lawyer, reared
in its celebrated university,
which has also given the church
six sovereign pontiffs, and amongst
them the witty and learned Benedict
XIV. To Bologna we owe the
great school of painting founded
by Francia, which boasts of
the Caracci, Domenichino, Guido,
and his pupil Guercino, besides
many others. We thought ourselves
unusually accurate and learned,
when, on arriving at the <hi rend='italic'>Accademia</hi>,
we asked the surly guardian
which way we ought to turn to get
to the <hi rend='italic'>Pinacoteca</hi>; and not till we
had, in a more roundabout form,
told him we wanted to see the pictures
would he condescend from
his stolid dignity to tell us where
to go. The Francias alone, the
S. Cecilia of Raphael, or the Martyrdom
of S. Agnes by Domenichino,
would be worth a yet longer
journey to behold. And the Head
of Christ Crowned with Thorns,
drawn in crayons by Guido, with
stains of damp on the paper, and
some slight discoloration from age,
leaves an impression on the memory
surpassing, to my mind, all
that artist's finished paintings. Bologna
has set an example our more
liberal times, as we are apt to think
them, seem unwilling to follow,
and are doing so but slowly and
grudgingly. The learned ladies
<pb n='211'/><anchor id='Pg211'/>
who aspire to equality with the
other sex might come here in a
body, raise the now declining
glories of the university, and fill
those comparatively empty halls.
Bologna has known female lawyers
of eminence, and doctors,
and at least one surgeon and anatomist
of the gentler sex, and
has done homage to their learning
and merit. Might it not be as
well to take advantage of a university
so large-minded, and once so
celebrated?&mdash;convinced, as we are,
that if the ladies took the lead, the
gentlemen would follow.
</p>

<p>
We had had the honor many
years ago of knowing Cardinal
Mezzofanti, so celebrated as a linguist.
He was a Bolognese, and had
been librarian of the university
here, and, when we knew him,
occupied an important post in the
Vatican library. At that time he
had mastered something like forty
languages. He told us that, a
short time previous, he had been
informed there was a poor sailor
come to Rome from some out-of-the-way
part of the world&mdash;Lapland,
I believe&mdash;who spoke a dialect no
one could understand or make
anything of; and that the man,
being a Catholic, wanted to go to
his Easter duties. The cardinal
sent for him, and made him discourse
in his presence. In two
days his eminence was quite ready
to hear his confession, and could
talk with the man in his own tongue
with fluency.
</p>

<p>
Through the cool, shady arcades
of beautiful Bologna we wandered
to the Piazza Vittoria Emanuel,
which formerly was known by the
more honorable name of Piazza del
Gigante. The crowd was so great
that we could hardly make our way
past the groups of peasants and
well-to-do farmers, in their warm,
brown cloaks, all talking and gesticulating,
with apparently nothing
else to do. There was a market
going on, but not one which seemed
of sufficient importance to justify
so large a crowd, and which probably
collects there daily, about
mid-day, out of the abundant leisure
which pervades Italian life,
even in its most industrious forms.
We visited the shrine of S. Dominic,
and were long engaged in admiring
its extraordinary beauty.
The saint died at Bologna in 1221.
He was in England when the vision
was granted him which revealed
to him that, before the next
Feast of the Assumption, his earthly
career would be closed, and, on
arriving at Bologna, had forewarned
the students at the university
that he was about to leave them.
Shortly after, he went to Venice on
the affairs of his order. He returned
to the monastery of S. Nicholas,
at Bologna, in the great heats of
the last days of July. The following
morning he celebrated his last
Mass, and said Office in choir. He
then complained of headache, but
refused to take any further repose
than was obtained by sitting on a
sack of wool which happened casually
to be at hand. Finding his suffering
increase, he sent for the novices,
to give them his last exhortation,
summing up all in these simple
words: <q>Be filled with charity,
keep humility, and observe voluntary
poverty.</q> In the hope that
a purer air might benefit their beloved
father and founder, they carried
him to the Church of S. Mary of
the Mount. But the journey, brief
as it was, proved rather to have
aggravated his condition. Once
again he addressed the assembled
brethren; and finding that there
was some idea of burying him
there, instead of in his own monastery,
<pb n='212'/><anchor id='Pg212'/>
he entreated to be taken back
to S. Nicholas, that he might, as he
expressed it, be buried beneath the
feet of his brothers. They wanted
to change his clothes, but discovered
he had no others but those he
wore. Brother Moneta therefore
lent him a habit. He had received
the last sacraments at S. Mary's of
the Mount; and finding that his
disciples, in the excess of their
grief, were delaying to read the
prayers for the dying, he was the
first to beg they would commence.
While they prayed around him, his
lips silently repeated the words;
and when they came to the sentence,
<q>Come to his assistance, ye
saints of God. Come forth to meet
him, ye angels of the Lord, receiving
his soul, and offering it in the
sight of the Most High,</q><note place='foot'>The above passage is really in the Prayers
for the Dead. The Dominican ritual differs in
some respects from the ordinary ritual; whether
it includes any difference in the Prayers for the
Dying I have been unable to ascertain. The
above account is taken from some passages in
Lacordaire's life of the saint. Lacordaire was
himself a Dominican.</note> he lifted
up his hands toward heaven, and
at the same moment gave up his
pure soul to God.
</p>

<p>
It was at noon, on Friday, the
6th of August. Thus he reached
his home five years before his companion
in arms in the warfare of
the great church militant, S. Francis
of Assisi, who was six years his
junior. The last words of the
holy dying are ever precious to the
Christian world; and it is to be
remarked that those of the canonized
saints have most frequently
been taken from Holy Scripture or
from the liturgy of the church. S.
Francis died repeating the 141st
Psalm; thus his last words were,
<q>Bring my soul out of prison, that
I may praise thy name: the just
wait for me, until Thou reward me.</q>
</p>

<p>
The greater part of our journey
to Bologna from Genoa had been
through a highly cultivated but
flat and uninteresting country.
The contrast was great on the railway
from Bologna to Florence, with
its forty-five tunnels, its sudden
turnings and windings, the beautiful
valleys of the Apennines, and
the mountains themselves looking
as if the giant hand of nature had
crushed them like rose-leaves, and
then flung them down with all the
crinkles in them. You look below
on fertile fields and beautiful little
towns nestling on the sides of green
hills, with gardens and meadows
smiling in the sunshine. As you
are attempting to realize the lovely
scene before you, the relentless
engine is bringing you nearer to
rugged rocks, with hanging woods
and fringes of the golden broom.
A black cavern yawns in front of
you, and in a second you are plunged
in darkness. Away you are
hurried, with grind, and puff, and
roar, regretting the sunny picture
from which you have so suddenly
been snatched. Just as you are
recovering from the shock, again
you emerge on a scene as beautiful
as the last; and again are you
doomed to lose it, almost before
your dazzled eyes have recovered
from this unnaturally rapid succession
of day and night, and which
reminded me of a certain planet,
where, as astronomers assure us,
the inhabitants, if there be any,
are exposed to the vicissitudes
of several days and nights in the
course of our comparatively leisurely
space of four-and-twenty hours.
I have always ventured to hope
they were not also condemned to
dress and undress each time;
otherwise I think many of them
must be tempted to follow the
example of that poor gentleman
who cut his throat, leaving a paper
<pb n='213'/><anchor id='Pg213'/>
on the table in which he stated
that it was the constant buttoning
and unbuttoning which had been
too much for him.
</p>

<p>
Nothing can exceed the beauty
of the view as the plain of Tuscany
opens before you. We had
seen it two-and-twenty years ago,
before any railroads were there to
cut short the delights of travelling.
We had gazed long and lingeringly
from out the windows of our travelling-carriage,
while the setting sun
left his last kiss on the mountain
heights, and the evening mists
gathered below. I, for one, had
never seen it since. But sometimes
in my dreams that view had come
back to me, and, when I awoke, it
Was still there. Sometimes the
phantasmagoria of the mind had
suddenly unfolded it before my
memory without my being able to
say when and where I had painted
that picture on my brain. And
now I saw it again; and suddenly
all those broken recollections
seemed to gather themselves together,
and unroll before me, while
my soul whispered, <q>Here is the
reality of what for so many years
has haunted you, and which you
have so often been tempted to
believe was a trick of your imagination.
It is a fact; and you can
recall it and put it together, piece
by piece; as you will do, far more
perfectly, the broken and half-forgotten
fragments of your life
when the barrier of death is passed.</q>
</p>

<p>
The only other wide expanse
which has left the same impression
on my imagination, waking and
sleeping, is the view from the
beautiful viaduct at Aricia, as it
first burst upon me&mdash;the vast campagna
and the crimson lights of the
setting sun.
</p>

<p>
This was our first visit to Florence
since the government had taken
possession of the Dominican
church and monastery of San
Marco, and opened the latter as a
museum to the public in 1869; so
that my old jealousy that Frank
could gaze at those wonderfully
lovely angels of Fra Angelico was
now at an end. I do not think
there is a cell without some exquisitely
devotional painting by the
monk-artist, whose every picture is
an embodied meditation and a
prayer. We paused long in the
two cells where Savonarola had
lived and studied and suffered.
The old question forced itself upon
me as to what had been the real
character of that grand, imposing
figure, which fills so large a page
in the history of Florence&mdash;the hard-featured
reformer, the man of relentless
will and burning eloquence.
Where was the little rift in the flute
which jarred that celestial music?
Where was the flaw in the gem
which spoiled its intrinsic value?
And which was the snare in his
life which prevented his growing
on into heroic virtue? His gifts
and graces were immense, and, at
one time at least, so supernatural
that they seemed at once the guarantee
and the pledge that he would
die a saint in the highest acceptation
of the word. Frank, who has
read a great deal about him, written
by all sides, is persuaded that it
was a form of spiritual pride and
dependence on himself that ruined
all. Of course, at this distance of
time, and judging only from existing
documents, no one can say
when precisely this began&mdash;when
the annihilation of self first gave
place to an inner complacency;
when that heart, covered, as before,
with the rude hair-shirt, began to
throb with a secret sentiment of
personal satisfaction in the graces
<pb n='214'/><anchor id='Pg214'/>
God had given. It must have been
long, if ever, before those set, stern
features began to betray that another
spirit had entered into the
soul of the ascetic monk, which
gradually was tarnishing the purity
of his spiritual life. But when the
end came, and he bowed to death
in its most dreadful form, hurried
on by the malignity of his enemies&mdash;who,
having once laid their hand
on their prey, feared lest the mercy
of Rome should be enlightened to
arrest its own mandate&mdash;can any
doubt that the man who had done
so much in a holy cause, and had
so decried the pomp and pride of
life, found all the graces attached
to a great and accepted sacrifice?
</p>

<p>
We hurry from Florence. And
though I might linger over my
pages, and make my story more full
of information, and possibly of interest,
I yet refrain from anything
that may trench on the character of
mere sketches, which alone I aim
at. Frank forms one of a deputation
to the Holy Father, and he was to
reach Rome by a certain day. We
arrived long enough before that
date to establish ourselves in a
house in the Ripetta, overlooking
the yellow Tiber. Charon, mild,
modern, and a Roman, ferries his
boat just beneath our windows.
The rope is fastened to a stake on
our balcony, and makes a creaking
noise as the boat crosses the river,
to which we are so habituated that
we think it musical. Charon wears
a glazed hat, and affects a nautical
air quite uncalled for, considering
his limited navigation. For the
moderate fee of one half-penny he
conveys his passengers to and fro
across the classic river. Landed
on the opposite shore, we pass along
a narrow lane, on one side limited
by a high wall, on the other by a
green bank paved with violet-leaves.
Modern violet-leaves, but doubtless
descendants of those that fell
beneath the coulter of Cincinnatus'
plough along these Quintian fields
that early morn when the anxious
senate went to call the half-naked
hero to another and less peaceful
field, and bade him cross the
Tiber (where we have done), and
turn his plough-share into a sword
against those ever-recurring Volsci
and Æqui. Let the violets grow,
O warrior ploughman! and in a
few brief days thou shalt return to
find the little purple flowers ready
to hail thy triumph. Shall we see
Racilia behind the tall vine-poles,
bearing the toga that is to cover the
brawny shoulders of the noble laborer?
Or have these familiar idyls
of our early life lost their charm in
the sterner and more assured memories
of Christian Rome?
</p>

<p>
The narrow, violet-bordered lane
leads into wide fields and to the
fortifications of the Castle of Sant'
Angelo. We are outside the gates
of the city. The white walls of
Rome stand glittering in the sunshine
to our left; to our right lies
the green, undulating Campagna;
and before us are the heights of
Monte Mario, pine-crowned.
</p>

<p>
S. Michael, poised in mid-air,
sheathes his avenging sword above
the huge round tower that was the
tomb of Hadrian, and by turns the
hiding-place of the popes or the
prison of their enemies.
</p>

<p>
Darkly looming against the blue-white
sky, the bronze figure of
Rome's guardian angel for ever
holds his weapon half-way out of
his scabbard, like the suspended
threat of an avenging power.
</p>

<p>
Dark-browed Roman women are
hanging out inconceivable colored
rags that surely never can have
served for human raiment, to dry
on the wooden rails that mark our
<pb n='215'/><anchor id='Pg215'/>
road. They are jabbering, in harsh
and femininely shrill tones, their
curtailed <foreign rend='italic'>patois</foreign> of the Roman
tongue; and the lark, in advance
of the season, is carolling overhead
in the motionless air and in the
quivering light of the mid-day sun.
We re-enter the city by the Porta
Angelica, and are standing on
the fields of the Vatican, where
stood Nero's circus and Nero's
gardens. Of all the characters of
the heathen Roman Empire, none
comes more prominently forward
as the very type of human depravity
and accomplished wickedness than
that of Nero. He seems the embodiment
of evil heightened by a
versatility of talent and varnished
by the gloss of a false poetic sense
that makes him the exact opposite
to all that produces heroic virtue
in its greatest charm, as well as its
highest glory, among the Christian
saints. His was the poet nature
debased to the lowest sensuality
and the meanest vanity. And in
the mystic saints, is there not ever
something of the poet nature carried
to its most subtle expression
and its utmost elevation in the
ascetic purity and tender devotion
of a S. Francis or a S. Gertrude?
There is a wonderful sequence in
the low-lying, half-hidden events
of the church's history. There is
a marvellous counterbalancing of
good against evil, as though the
providence of God had (if we may
use the expression) taken pleasure
in substituting light for darkness,
and beauty for ugliness; selecting
in each the exact counterpart of the
other, and placing them in juxtaposition.
And so it is in this spot,
which most brings to our recollection
the lavish and foul luxury of
Rome's artist emperor, the degraded
being who was by turns actor,
poet, musician, wrestler, or coachman,
but fiend always! There,
where the horrid pomp of his midnight
revels was lighted up by the
living and burning forms of the
meek martyrs of the church&mdash;there
we now have the grandest monument
of the faith for which those
martyrs died that ever has been, or
probably ever will be. And the
great saints, the pillars of the
church, the founders and foundresses
of her armies of religious orders,
stand now, sculptured in cool marble
niches along the aisles of that
gorgeous Basilica which stands on
the very ground of Nero's infamous
gardens. There, too, was another
<q>Potter's Field,</q> in which to bury
strangers; for the clay soil on
which S. Peter's is built had served
in the old Roman manufactory of
bricks and earthenware. The potters
had excavated numberless caves
on the slopes of the Vatican hills,
where subsequently the Christians
concealed themselves, and, as in
the other catacombs of Rome, celebrated
the divine mysteries and
buried their dead. It is said that
S. Peter himself, on his first journey
to Rome, baptized many in these
very catacombs&mdash;many, probably,
who later on had received that
other baptism of blood in the ghastly
revels of Nero's gardens, and
whose remains were gathered together
secretly by the brethren, and
buried in the caves of the <q>Potter's
Fields.</q> And now the strangers
have become possessors; the holy
dead have consecrated what might
well have been called another <q>field
of blood</q>; and the successors of
S. Peter sit in reverend state and
govern Christendom on the very
spot where the first Bishop of Rome
celebrated in secret the first Masses
Rome ever witnessed. The grain
of mustard-seed has indeed become
a great and goodly tree, and the
<pb n='216'/><anchor id='Pg216'/>
birds of all nations and all ages
lodge in the beneficent shadow of
its branches.
</p>

<p>
The whole history of the Basilica
of S. Peter, whether the first that
sheltered the relics of the apostles,
or the present more magnificent
one, built from the designs of Bernini,
and completed by Michael
Angelo, teems with facts of this
nature.
</p>

<p>
The old roof of S. Peter's was
covered by Pope Honorius I. with
the gilt bronze tiles that had roofed,
some historians say the temple
of Romulus, others that of Jupiter
Capitolinus, possibly of both; as
though the first founders of pagan
Rome, the Romulus and Remus of
history and legend, were to pay
tribute to the founders of Christian
Rome, the great apostles SS. Peter
and Paul, whose blood cemented
the walls of the early church,
and over whose sacred relics that
venerable roof was to hang; or, as
if the false Jove, dethroned and
vanquished by the fisherman, were
stripped of his splendor to do honor
to the true God. The tiles have
been removed elsewhere now, but
the fact still retains its touching
import. And the like is carried
out in the present Basilica; for the
Pantheon, raised to the honor of its
myriad of demon gods, gave up
the bronze of its portico at the
command of Urban VIII., that out
of it Bernini might fashion that
wonderful work, the <hi rend='italic'>Baldacchino</hi>
over the high altar. Wonderful
work! that, as we gaze at it, never
weary and ever admiring, we ask
ourselves in what way the mind of
the architect<note place='foot'>The <hi rend='italic'>Baldacchino</hi> at S. Peter's is by Bernini.</note> wrought when he
brought forth this splendid design.
Did it come to him at once, like the
one grand idea ruling all the cadences
of action in a Greek play? Or
did he build it up, piece by piece,
in his soul, and touch and retouch
the beautiful image like the finished
diversities of an idyl? We incline
to the first, for that is most like inspiration,
and the <hi rend='italic'>Baldacchino</hi> of
S. Peter's must have been an inspiration.
</p>

<p>
As we pass beneath the deep shadow
of the great colonnade of S.
Peter's into the vast piazza facing
the Basilica, it is like stepping from
the mazes of a forest out into the
sunny plain. Almost catching the
diamond spray of these ever-joyous
fountains, we mount the easy steps,
so dignified in their gradual ascent,
and pass into the gallery of the
façade with the same awe-struck
feeling we have experienced when
suddenly we have found our frank
glance come in unexpected contrast
with the deep, scrutinizing gaze
of a dark eye and the overhanging
solemnity of a thoughtful and
heavy-laden brow. And first the
bass-relief before us tells us the
history of the church. Christ delivers
the keys to S. Peter, who,
kneeling, receives the tokens of his
high office. At either end of the
long gallery are the equestrian statues
of two great imperial defenders
and benefactors of the church: Constantine
the Great still gazes on the
labarum that appeared to him in
mystic form not far off on that very
hill of Monte Mario, pine-crowned,
and where now stands a church in
commemoration of the event&mdash;an
event which turned the City on
Seven Hills, the Babylon of the prophecies,
the woman drunk with the
blood of the martyrs, into the Eternal
City, the port of the church's
bark, the patrimony of S. Peter,
and the home of all Christian hearts&mdash;the
city of which a great and
royal sufferer once said; <q>J'ai trouvé
<pb n='217'/><anchor id='Pg217'/>
que Rome est l'endroit où on peut
le mieux se passer du bonheur.</q><note place='foot'><q>I have found that Rome is the place where
one can enjoy the most happiness.</q></note>
Here all sorrow is ennobled, all
grief is sheltered. The great King
of the church is himself <q>the Man
of Sorrows,</q> and here his Vicar
reigns!
</p>

<p>
At the very entrance we pause to
ponder over as touching an elegy
as ever was written <hi rend='italic'>in memoriam</hi>;
and the grief it portrays is that of
the other great defender of the
church, whose equestrian statue
meets us on the left end of the
gallery&mdash;Charlemagne mourns for
Adrian I.
</p>

<p>
<q>I, Charles, write these verses,
weeping for my father! Yea, my
father, my dear love! These verses
are my lamentation for thy loss.
Be thou ever mindful of me, whose
memory seeks thee dwelling with
Christ in the blessed region of
heaven. The priests and the people
loved thee with a great love,
and all with one love, best of shepherds!
Great friend! I mingle in
one our names and our illustrious
titles. Adrian and Charles&mdash;emperor,
I; and father, thou!</q>
</p>

<p>
In the history of nations, as in
the life of individuals, there is a
not unfrequent repetition of events
bearing the same type though not the
same in fact. They give a characteristic
coloring to the biography
of the individual or the history of
the people. The events and the
man react on each other. But
this is especially true, and in a far
deeper sense, with the history of
God's church. When the Israelites
came out of Egypt, they spoiled the
Egyptians. They carried away as
a tribute the treasures unwillingly
conceded by their former masters.
The Christian world, on the conversion
of Constantine, stepped forth
from the darkness and despotism of
paganism, and Charlemagne, as if
in commemoration of this antitype
of that deliverance, endowed the
church of S. Peter with rich tributes
from Egypt for the benefaction
of the clergy, and for the
lighting and repairing of the great
Basilica. Human governments are
generally ungrateful; but the
church is a divine government,
though carried on through human
agents, and gratitude is one of her
virtues and one of her most distinctive
attributes. Constantine
and Charlemagne are not forgotten.
Their statues guard the entrance
of S. Peter's, as erstwhile their
power guarded and endowed the see
of Peter. Nor shall even the weaker
sex fail of the tribute liberally
paid to loyalty and devotion. There
is something sublime in the gratitude
depicted in the monument to
the Countess Mathilda, who holds
in her hands the mitre and the
keys, as though to suggest the idea of
consigning them to the protection
of the great mediatrix of the incorrigible
Emperor of the West, Henry
IV., and who had sheltered in
her own dominions the great S.
Gregory, and done so much to increase
the patrimony of the church.
A royal father giving his crown and
sceptre into the hands of a favorite
child could not more touchingly
portray the loving appreciation of
the sovereign pontiffs towards one
who had been so true to the church's
cause. And time has no effect in
diminishing the gratitude of that
church which is built upon a rock,
and where all is enduring, any more
than it has in diminishing the glory
of the saints; for it was Urban
VIII. who erected the monument
in S. Peter's to the spiritual daughter
of the great Hildebrand, Gregory
VII.&mdash;a grateful memory of
<pb n='218'/><anchor id='Pg218'/>
more than six hundred years' standing!
</p>

<p>
We have often heard people
complain of a sentiment of disappointment
on first entering S. Peter's.
It has been accounted for
by the fact that the perfect proportion
and harmony of the whole,
producing therefore no startling
contrasts, fail to effect so sudden
an impression on the mind as
would be the case were the harmony
less absolute. To this it may
be replied that some minds are more
alive to impressions of harmony,
and others to those of contrast.
We can best speak from experience,
and we all agreed that nowhere
had we felt such a sense of completeness
and its consequent repose fall
upon our souls as when we pushed
aside that heavy leathern portal,
and passed within the precincts
of S. Peter's. I do not remember
ever to have done so, though I
have probably been there fifty
times, without an involuntary pause
as I first entered; and before approaching
the holy-water stoups,
supported by white marble boys of
six feet high, who carry a large
marble shell between them, and,
everything being large in proportion,
fail not to look like infants,
in spite of their real size. The
first chapel to the right as you enter
is the one in which a large
number of very valuable relics
are kept in rich reliquaries, and
which are only shown to the public
on certain days. These are
distinct from the great relics of the
Passion, which are exhibited to the
crowd from the <foreign rend='italic'>loggia</foreign> in the dome
on either side of the high altar
during Holy Week. I used to be
attracted to that chapel, which is
otherwise less striking than many
of the others, by the Pietà of Michael
Angelo. In my father's house
in England we have that same
Pietà, said to be an original. It
is on a smaller scale and unfinished;
at least the head and features
of Our Lady always gave me that
impression. Not so the figure of
Our Lord, which is full of the sad
tenderness of death. The utter
supineness of the limbs and of the
arm, which has fallen off Our Lady's
lap, and hangs down; the beauty
of the worn face; the wonderfully
graceful and yet manly hands,
pierced, like the feet; the general
position of the whole body, like a
broken flower flung on the Mother's
lap&mdash;are full of the deepest
religious feeling and pathos. But
it is difficult thoroughly to appreciate
it where it stands in S. Peter's.
It is over the altar, and one had
need do as I used to do at P&mdash;&mdash;,
when a child, to be able to appreciate
all the details. I used to go
alone, when I was sure of not being
caught, down the dark, dreary passage
which led to the dark, disused
chapel, on the damp, marble pavement
of which stood this supposed
original of the Pietà. Then getting
a chair from a bath-room in
the vicinity of the chapel, I stood
upon that, so as to bring myself
nearly on a level with the head of
Our Lady, and thus be able to
look down, as she does, on the dead
Christ supported on her knees.
</p>

<p>
How often in S. Peter's I have
wished I could do the same with
the undoubted work of Michael
Angelo, and trace again in every
line the pathetic beauty of suffering
and death, as, with eyes full of
tears, I had done in early life! The
Pietà at S. Peter's has the same
absence of real beauty in the face
of Our Lady with the one at P&mdash;&mdash;;
the same long upper lip and want
of finish. It also gives a like impression
with all other <hi rend='italic'>pietàs</hi>, in
<pb n='219'/><anchor id='Pg219'/>
which the Mother is represented
as holding her Divine Son on her
knees&mdash;a thing which in reality
would be impossible. No woman
could support on her knees the
dead body of a full-grown man.
Michael Angelo, whose idealism
was always under the control of
his marvellous anatomical drawing,
was too conscious of that not to
endeavor palpably to counteract
what probably, as he was working
at the group, he felt to be an invincible
objection. He has certainly
made it look possible in his Pietà,
but he has done it at the expense
of beauty and congruity. The
Blessed Virgin's lap is enormous;
her whole figure looks powerful and
gigantic, while that of the Saviour
is undersized in proportion.
</p>

<p>
I have often paused in the space
opposite this first chapel, across the
nave, to watch some fifty little
urchins learning their catechism.
Merry little creatures they seemed
to be, all more or less in the <foreign rend='italic'>négligé</foreign>
attire of Italian beggar life, picturesque
in color and dilapidated in
texture. Sparkling black eyes and
gleaming white teeth were their
chief and never-failing beauty.
They sat on low forms, or rather
they leant upon them, lay upon
them, scrambled over them, waiting
for their instructor, who always
seemed long in coming. When at
last he did arrive, a faint semblance
of order was established. The little
creatures shouted forth the answers
in a sort of loud sing-song,
nudging each other all the time,
swinging their little, naked, well-bronzed
legs, and keeping up some
perennial jokes all the time with each
other, but little in unison with the
words they were repeating. I cannot
say that their demeanor seemed
at all to affect the stolid gravity of
their priestly instructor, or even to
try his patience. He simply ignored
it. He appeared to have no
eyes nor ears for any sound but
the well-known monotony of the
responses. It is to be hoped something
may come back to them of it
all when they are old enough to
think. For myself, I could only
reflect on what a strange reminiscence
it would seem to me to have
learnt my catechism beneath the
dome of S. Peter's. To these little,
careless mortals, it was only a part
of their everyday life.
</p>

<p>
The niches, filled with colossal
statues of the founders and foundresses
of religious orders, embellish
the walls on all sides; and probably
all Catholics look out for some
special saint as they wander
through the Basilica. We used
particularly to salute S. Teresa and
S. Frances of Rome; the latter attended
by her guardian angel.
These statues produce a grand
effect, being all of white marble,
standing in niches of many-colored
marbles and rich carving, though
they are far from all having artistic
merit. There are still some niches
empty. Who will fill them? What
saintly founders or foundresses of
new orders does the future of the
church still reserve for us? Or will
the last day come, and find those
niches empty still? With the exception
of the four statues under
the dome, they are (and must always
be) canonized saints and
founders of orders.
</p>

<p>
I have heard of people whose
great ambition was to be buried in
Westminster Abbey. I knew one
pretty bride, of high rank and
youthful ambition, who was married
in the Abbey because she was persuaded
that her husband would be
a great statesman, and that his
grateful country would bury him
there. But I never heard of any
<pb n='220'/><anchor id='Pg220'/>
one who dreamed of filling one of
the empty niches in S. Peter's. On
first entering the church, one sees
the many lamps burning round the
Confessional of S. Peter, as the
high altar is called. They seem
to pour an orange-colored glow
all around. You stand or kneel
against the marble balustrade, and
look down on the kneeling figure of
Pius VI. before the tomb of his greater
predecessor. It is a beautiful, restful
image of perpetual prayer, and
is one of the few works of Canova
I have ever really admired. Against
the marble balustrade there hang
some wooden frames containing an
indulgenced prayer and hymn to
S. Peter and S. Paul in Latin. I
once had a curious illustration of
how a trifle may strike a stranger,
while it escapes the notice of one in
the habit of seeing it constantly. I
never went to S. Peter's that I did
not say that prayer at the tomb of
the apostles; for it must be remembered
the relics (not all of them)
of S. Paul lie here, as well as those
of S. Peter. I had had occasion to
insert them in a manuscript, which
fell into the hands of a certain
very learned Capuchin, who holds a
high post in his order, and in connection,
also, with the Sovereign
Pontiff. He surprised me by asking
me where I got those prayers
and hymns. He had never read
them before, in the many years he
had lived at Rome in the venerable
convent of his order, and might
have seen them fastened by a small
chain to the spot where he must
so often have knelt. Perhaps the
fact that in every church in Rome
you will find an indulgenced prayer
printed up somewhere as an incentive
to devotion, may have led to
his not particularly noticing the
one at S. Peter's.
</p>

<p>
Frank used to tell Mary he never
knew any one so greedy of indulgences
as she was. She always
looked out for these short prayers;
she never went to S. Peter's without
kneeling, as she passed the
priests in their confessionals, to receive
the little tap from the long
wand they have in front of the confessional,
and to the receiving of
which an indulgence is attached.
He used to tell her laughingly that
he did not understand how she had
the face to disturb the priest saying
his Office, and oblige him to lift his
eyes from his Breviary, and detach
the long stick as she knelt a yard
or two distant. We have seen her
unblushingly obtain three raps in
succession with all the devotion
possible; and then, when she and I
were looking another way, Frank
would strive against his natural
British undemonstrativeness, and
kneel for the little blow, getting up
again with a shy blush. Mary and
I never took any notice. We knew
that the small act of humility, which,
among the childlike Italians, came
almost as a matter of course, cost
him far more than it did us, and
therefore had more merit. The
Romans have a harmless superstition
that if you are leaving Rome,
and are anxious to return, you will
not fail to do so if you deposit some
small coin in a safe place. I had
done so the last time I had been
there; and, sure enough, I was back
again to claim my money. But
though I could remember the part
of the church beneath the statue of
S. Juliana where I had dropt it into
a crevice, I never could find it
again. However, that did not matter,
since the charm had worked
successfully. A draught of the water
from the fountain of Trevi is
said to have the same effect. I
drank a cupful once in pure jest,
and have been to Rome four times
<pb n='221'/><anchor id='Pg221'/>
since; but something more powerful
than the hidden half-pence or the
fountain of Trevi has lured me back
again. There is, I believe, no spot
in the world where everybody gets
to feel so at home as in Rome, outside
the land of their birth and the
roof that shelters all their domestic
affections.
</p>

<p>
In the same place where I had
hidden my little coin I remember a
scene which filled my imagination
with interest and admiration. It was
Holy Thursday. The high altar
was being stripped of all the ornaments,
and washed with wine, to the
mournful chanting of the choir; the
daylight was fast declining, though
still some rays of the setting sun
stole through the yellow-tinted
windows below the dome; and
the Grand Penitentiary was seated
in his violet robes on a raised platform,
in a crimson velvet chair,
with no partition between him and
the low stool to his right, on which
the penitents were to kneel. There
were several steps, covered with
cloth, to mount from the pavement
of the church to the seat of the
prelate; and at some distance
from these was a temporary railing
to prevent the crowd from approaching
within hearing of what
should pass between the penitent
and the priest. We stood among
the crowd. The penitent was a
man of about thirty years of age,
with coal-black hair and beard,
deep, dark eyes, and regular features.
It was very curious to hear
the remarks of the bystanders; and
they were very characteristic of
Italians, born to the faith. Most
of them were praying aloud, in brief
ejaculations, that God would grant
him perfect contrition. The women
especially were exclaiming:
<q>Ah! poverello, ma piange!</q><note place='foot'>Ah! poor fellow. Why, he is weeping!</note>
Two priests passed through the
crowd, and paused a moment, with
a smile of indescribable benevolence
and satisfaction that a big fish had
been caught in Peter's net, and was
being drawn to land. The confession
lasted a long time. The man
never for a moment shifted his position;
but by degrees the venerable
prelate bent his ear closer and
closer to the poor penitent, and his
countenance showed a mixture of
compassion and tenderness quite
paternal. The man's forehead almost
touched the priest's shoulder,
as he poured forth his long history
of error and shame. At length the
priest's hand was raised to give the
absolution, and a murmur of relief
and congratulation ran through the
crowd of spectators. The hand
rested on the man's head before he
rose from his knees. He came
quickly down the steps. The crowd
parted to let him pass. He can
have seen none but smiling and
happy glances all around him, if he
cared to look up; but all silently
made way for him, and in a moment
he was lost in the multitude,
absolved and released from the
burden of some <q>reserved case.</q>
Of course there were many conjectures
as to who and what he might
be. Some said he had been a bandit;
others that he was a priest
who had broken his vows, and
made this confession in public as
an act of greater humility; for of
course it is not imperative to carry
all reserved cases to the Grand
Penitentiary, nor need the penitent
wait for Lent to get absolution.
Nevertheless, the prelate with
power to absolve all reserved cases
(of which murder is one) occupies
that raised confessional throughout
Lent for certain hours of the day.
Mary was so overcome at the piety
and charity of the crowd in the
<pb n='222'/><anchor id='Pg222'/>
warm interest they evinced, and
observed so often that it must be
delightful to be thus prayed for
while making one's confession, that
we began to apprehend she would
mount the platform herself, had
not Frank timely observed to her
that, in all probability, she had no
reserved case on her conscience!
</p>

<p>
By this time the shades of night
were closing in. The lights were
all extinguished. The altars stood
bare and cold. The dark crowd
swayed in dense masses towards the
open doors. The light of the moon
struggled pale and wan through the
high windows where the setting sun
had lately thrown a golden glow.
The vast cathedral echoed to the
steps of the departing crowd, and
we turned towards home, more
deeply impressed with the desolation
expressed by the Holy Thursday
ceremonies in S. Peter's in the
stripping of the altars than with
many others more generally remarked.
</p>

<p>
It was night before we reached
our apartment in the Ripetta.
</p>

<p>
Mary's bedroom overlooked the
river, and in the morning she could
see S. Peter's bathed in the rosy
light of the rising sun, while flights
of white sea-gulls came up the river
with the early tide to feed upon
the refuse which had been thrown
into the water. They came swooping
down, with their glittering plumage
flashing in the sunshine, and,
dipping low, would snatch some
dainty morsel from the swift water,
and mount up, in graceful, curving
flight, to repeat the same again and
again. As the port was close to
our house, no doubt it was an advantageous
position for both the
breakfast and supper of the gulls.
They always returned in the evening,
but at no other hour in the
day. At night we could see lights
in three windows of the Vatican.
They were always there, and always
at about the same hour they disappeared.
One day, when Mary was
calling on Cardinal Antonelli he
asked her where we were living;
and on her describing the position,
and how she could see S. Peter's
and the Vatican, and specially those
three windows, he told her the
lights were from his own apartment.
His eminence is very fond of flowers,
and has a garden in Rome, in
which he takes great pleasure.
They were talking of flowers, and
he observed to Mary that she would
find very much the same flora
throughout Europe, though not of
course equally distributed. Mary
objected that she had never seen
the little common yellow primrose
of our English woods, in that part
of Italy. <q>Nevertheless, you will
find we have it,</q> was his reply.
And not long after, on our way to
Viterbo, we saw its starry blossoms
by the roadside, and hailed it as an
old friend, dearer to our hearts than
even the graceful pink cyclamen,
which from the position of the petals
reminds me of a pretty, blushing
child with her hair all drawn back
from her forehead.
</p>

<p>
What memories crowd upon me as
I recall these trivial incidents! What
happy hours have I spent beneath
that deep-blue but not unclouded
sky, with the warm breeze perfumed
by the breath of violets in the
Doria Pamphili Villa! The great
stone pines, with their soft, unceasing
sighs; the large willows dropping
their bright-green flexible
wands into the clear water; the
violet anemones, with here and
there a large crimson one, or a yellow
tulip lighting up the soft green
grass like a sparkling gem; the violets,
not bashful and hidden shrinkingly
beneath their leaves, as in
<pb n='223'/><anchor id='Pg223'/>
our colder climes, but lifting their
little dark-purple heads high in the
air, to drink the light and leave a
perfumed kiss on every breeze that
floats; soft masses of white cloud
sailing slowly over the blue ether,
and casting dappled shadows on
the long grass. In the distance is
S. Peter's and the Vatican, with fields
of broken ground in many tints of
yellow and green and red between it
and the stone balustrade against
which we lean. It appears, from this
point of view, to be quite outside
the city, and to stand alone and
untrammelled by meaner buildings.
Behind us is a dense avenue of venerable
ilex, and but now we were
visiting the Colombarium, the other
side of the road, and moralizing on
the pagan practice of cremation, as
compared with the hallowed Christian
sepulture&mdash;it must have been
so difficult to realize that the little
handful of ashes in the urn had
anything to do with the dead wife
or child or father, that they had
loved, embraced, and conversed
with!
</p>

<p>
Again, I remember a day when
we were living at Capo le Case. I
took Ann with me, and we set out
for a long walk regardless of the
flight of time. We directed our
course to S. John Lateran. On
our way, we paused at San Clemente,
where we had several times visited
the subterranean church under the
guidance of the kind and learned
F. Mullooly. Few, perhaps, have
ever noticed, in a church which
presents so much else to interest
them, a small picture, the head of
S. Catharine of Sienna, over an
altar at the bottom of the church,
on the right hand. It is modern,
and by a Dominican artist whose
name is unknown to me, and probably
to all save the brothers of
his order. Nevertheless, I have
never seen devotion more exquisitely
depicted than in that sweet,
sorrowful face, with the tears standing
in the large, uplifted eyes.
Through the open door of the
church penetrated the scent of large
masses of Banksia roses that hung
over a wall in a garden nearly
opposite. Untrained, untrimmed
they flung long wreaths to the wind,
and lay in cloud-like bunches of
soft, creamy white. As we passed
by the door of the hospital of the
Salvatore, two Sisters stepped out
into the sunshine, on some errand
of charity for their sick and aged
patients. We then visited the
Basilica of S. John Lateran, <q>the
mother and head of all churches.</q>
The gigantic statues of the apostles
have a very imposing effect, in spite
of their many artistic faults, more
so, perhaps, than the equally faulty
statues at S. Peter's. Then we
wandered into the large piazza in
front of the cathedral, and looked
beyond the gates and crumbling
fortifications of Rome upon the
Alban hills. The long avenue of
trees leading to the church of
Santa Croce di Gerusalemme were
coming into leaf; so were the group
of trees to our right, by the low
wall of the piazza, on which grew
tufts of fern and yellow-blossomed
oxalis. We sat on the steps, and
ate some hot chestnuts I had bought
by the roadside, getting, at the
same time, a pinch of salt from a
dark-browed matron, with a yellow
kerchief across her ample bosom,
and a silver dagger in her hair,
who sold cigars in a little wooden
booth. It was enough to be alive
on such a day and in such a scene,
with the easy liberty of Italian life
and the total absence of <q>Mrs.
Grundy.</q> There was no one to
see us (save a few beggar-women)
sitting on the steps of the grand
<pb n='224'/><anchor id='Pg224'/>
portico, and scattering the skins of
our chestnuts on the pavement at
our feet, while we silently drank in
the balmy air and rejoiced in the
beauty of the view before us. Ere
we returned, we visited the Scala
Santa, and looked long on Giacometti's
beautiful group of the Kiss
of Judas. The evening was closing
in when, wearied but satisfied,
we reached our home. But if these
remembrances are full of light and
warmth, not less pleasing are those
of our moonlight drives the year
that we remained in Rome till the
middle of July, and every evening
used to visit the Colosseum, or S.
John Lateran and Santa Maria
Maggiore, stopping to gaze long
upon the cold silver light, so sharp
and sudden on every curve and
shaft, on architrave and entablature,
on capital and plinth, while the
dense shadows lurked behind like
black stains of unfathomable darkness.
Then we would drive to
S. Peter's, and after crossing the
bridge of Sant' Angelo between
the angels, each holding an instrument
of the Passion, we would
look across the dark river to see
the covered balcony of the house
where Michael Angelo was an
honored guest, and had introduced
the young Raphael to the small
circle of favored ones who met
nightly under that roof. There, too,
Vittoria Colonna probably came
to increase the charm by her wit
and beauty, while Michael Angelo
nourished those sentiments of
pure and profound veneration for
her great merits which made him
bitterly reproach himself after her
unexpected death, because he who
had never breathed one word of
love to her while living, had dared
to press a kiss on her marble brow
when cold in death. What noble
sentiments, what lofty times! And
yet in many things how unseemly
would some of their practices appear
to us? For it was in the
Church of San Silvestro al Quirinale
that they used to meet after
Vespers, to converse and laugh
and jest together. We look across
the river to mark that house. It is
dark and silent now. No lights
gleam from the windows. Half-defaced
frescos still cover some of
the walls, but it is let from top to
bottom to several families of the
very poorest of the people.
</p>

<p>
But I must pause. Rome is inexhaustible,
whether in her classic, her
Christian, or her artistic treasures;
besides the charm of social intercourse,
the delight of varied society,
and the equal ease and splendor
which may be found in the
interior life of her princely palaces.
Nor can I close this chapter without
speaking of one whose presence,
though now confined within
the walls of his own palace,
makes Rome so doubly dear
to the true Catholic. The days are
gone when our afternoon drive
might be gladdened by the pleasure
of finding the well-known
crimson coach and magnificent
black horses checking our progress,
while we hastened to descend and
kneel where he would pass, that we
might catch a glance, perhaps a
smile, and certainly the blessing, of
the venerable old man in whom we
recognize the Vicar of Christ. We
had been admitted to more than
one private audience, besides witnessing
several of those receptions
in which hundreds of people of
many nations knelt to kiss his feet,
and to hear that sweet, clear voice
utter words of exhortation and encouragement.
This last time we had
entered the Vatican with sad and altered
feelings. It was no longer a
gala-day, that on which we were to
<pb n='225'/><anchor id='Pg225'/>
visit the universal father of Christendom.
We were going to condole
with an august prisoner, a father
defrauded of his rights, a sovereign
deprived of his possessions.
We all felt depressed and inclined for
silence. The Pope had been indisposed,
and, as we were kept waiting
a long time, we began to fear
His Holiness would prove unable
to receive us. Our spirits flagged
with every second that we were left
in expectation, till Mary began to
look so pale I feared that she was
ill. At length, however, we perceived
a stir among the crimson-liveried
servants who were in attendance
in the vestibule; presently
the curtain at the end of the
long gallery where we stood was
drawn aside, and once again our
eyes beheld him who is ever present
to our thoughts, and whose
name is breathed in so many prayers.
The first feeling that filled
our beating hearts, as we looked on
his saintly and venerable face, was
joy to feel that he was still amongst
us; that despite increasing years,
and the increasing malice and hatred
of his enemies, his eye had
not dimmed or his strength failed
him. This impression was increased
with every word he spoke.
It was like the dawn which promises
the perfect day, no matter
how dark the night has been.
<q>The people imagine a vain thing!</q>
He is still with us&mdash;he, the father
of his people! He may be ours
for years to come. He may see
the day-spring of the church again.
He may live to witness her triumph.
And should it be otherwise&mdash;should
that white head be
laid low before the triumph of the
church over her enemies&mdash;will he
see it less, will he share it less, because
he has gone before? Impossible!
The church militant and
the church triumphant are one.
But our hopes go further; or rather,
they are more human. We
believe that Pius IX. will live to
see the end of confusion and the
beginning of peace; the downfall
of falsehood and oppression, and
the restoration of himself (and
others) to all their rights. May
God grant it!

<head>Preface.</head>

<p>
Who has not heard of those Christian communities which have held their own during so many
centuries, on the citied slopes of the Lebanon, or on the adjacent plains? Several of them have existed
from a period earlier than that in which the foundations of our oldest monarchies were laid. The
Maronites derive their name from Maron, a hermit of the IVth century, whose cell, on the banks of
the Orontes, gradually attracted a Christian population about it. In the VIIth and VIIIth centuries,
when the sword of the False Prophet was carrying all before it, they retreated from the uplands
of the Euphrates and Mesopotamia to the fastnesses of the Lebanon. The Melchites, a race of unquestionably
Arab origin, and whose religious offices are still celebrated in Arabic, emigrated to
Syria before the Christian era, and became Christian in the IVth century. Weakened by their
hereditary feuds, they retain, notwithstanding, all the pride of their ancient stock, and not less all
its heroism, its generosity, its hospitality, its sense of honor, and its passion for poetry and eloquence.
The devotion of both these races to their Faith is sufficiently attested by their having retained it during
so many centuries of wrong, and in spite of so many persecutions. In the massacres of 1860 alone
about 12,000 of them perished.
</p>

<p>
Few subjects are more worthy of attention than the ways of a People which still keeps so much
of what belonged to the feudal and monastic system of Europe in the Middle Ages, and combines
them with the patriarchal traditions of the world's morning. Much that we possess they lack; but,
among them, some of the affections&mdash;Patriotism and Love, for instance&mdash;retain a meaning which appears
to grow daily more rare amid the boasted civilization of the West. That meaning is illustrated
alike in their lives and their poetry. It has been observed that the religious poetry of the East
sometimes resembles love-poetry. The converse remark may no less be made. Eastern love-poetry
is wide in its range; but its more characteristic specimens resemble the early poetry of religion or patriotic
devotion, so full are they of elevation and self-sacrifice. I know not how far the spirit of such
poetry can make itself intelligible to the sympathies of the West. To many readers the present
poem will be an experiment new, not only as regards its spirit, but its form also&mdash;that of a story
narrated in songs. It was composed, in substance, some years ago, when the author was in the
East.

<l rend='margin-left: 2'>If she is pensive, is it for my sake?</l>

<lg>
<l>Perchance she joins the dance with other maids:</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>With whom? By whose are those white fingers pressed?</l>

<l rend='margin-left: 2'>We passed. If I was weak, yet Love was strong.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>On, ever on, through mountainous defiles,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>By Love sustained, upborne, on piloted,</l>
<l>I wound o'er laughing lakes and happy isles;</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>I asked not whither, and I felt no dread.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>I breathed, methought, some everlasting spring:</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>I passed, methought, in endless, aimless quest</l>
<l>(A dew-drop hanging on an eagle's wing)</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l>That dream had end. Once more I saw her face:</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>No love it looked: the sweet lips breathed no sound:</l>
<l>Then fell I, stone-like, through the fields of space,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>And lay, dead bulk, upon the bleeding ground.</l>

<lg>
<l>Nightly on thee the stars thou lov'st shall gaze:</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Thee and thy heaven no envious cloud can sever:</l>
<l>In vain to her I love mine eyes I raise;</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>And therefore, happy stream, farewell for ever!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Pale passion slays or dies. I would die young,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Live while I live; then sink without a sigh,</l>
<l>As some swift wave, from central ocean sprung,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Subsides into the flat tranquillity.</l>

<head>F. Louage's Philosophy.<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>A Course of Philosophy; embracing Logic,
Metaphysics, and Ethics.</hi> Designed as a text-book
for the use of schools. By Rev. A. Louage,
C.S.C., Professor in the University of Notre
Dame. Baltimore: Kelly, Piet &amp; Co. 1873.</note></head>

<p>
The design of F. Louage in compiling
this little text-book is most
praiseworthy, and one which we are
especially bound to commend, as it
is an attempt to carry out a plan
we have repeatedly and earnestly
advocated in this magazine, of furnishing
good text-books of philosophy,
written in the English language.
The credit of originating
this purpose belongs, so far as we
know, to the Christian Brothers.
The good work had, indeed, been
begun by Mr. Brownson, in translating
the <hi rend='italic'>Fundamental Philosophy</hi>
of Balmes. Nevertheless, as this is
not precisely suited for use as a
text-book, the preparation of such
a text-book remained a desideratum;
and our attention was first
called to the practical need of one
or more of these text-books by a
letter to the editor from the Superior
of the Christian Brothers at
Baltimore, urging the great necessity
of translating some one of the
Latin manuals, or preparing a new
one. This demand was the occasion
of our mooting the question in
these pages, and since that time the
demand has been supplied by three
different publications. One of these
is the translation of Balmes' admirable
<hi rend='italic'>Treatise on Logic</hi>, brought out
under the auspices of the Christian
Brothers; another, the first part of
F. Hill's <hi rend='italic'>Philosophy</hi>, which has
been highly commended both in
Europe and in this country, and a
third is the work now under notice.
</p>

<p>
We have delayed noticing this
text-book by F. Louage for a long
time, simply from a feeling of reluctance
to express, without obvious
necessity, the judgment which we
formed on first perusing it&mdash;that it
is very far from being a successful
effort, and, moreover, that it contains
a philosophical doctrine which
cannot be safely taught in our Catholic
schools. We shall proceed
by-and-by to establish the justice
of both these criticisms; but, beforehand,
we wish to offer a few
preliminary remarks explaining the
past and present attitude of <hi rend='smallcaps'>The
Catholic World</hi> in respect to
soundness of philosophical doctrine.
</p>

<p>
It is well known that a number
of doctrinal decisions on philosophical
topics have been promulgated
by the reigning Sovereign Pontiff,
which have made the true sense
and teaching of the church on several
important points much more
clear and definite than it had previously
been to a large number of
sincere and learned Catholics. For
a long time, some of these decisions&mdash;those,
namely, concerning ontologism&mdash;were
not universally known,
and their import had not been sufficiently
discussed and explained
to give a certain and distinct direction
to those who, like ourselves,
in this country, had not been <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>au
courant</foreign> with the affairs which
brought about these decisions.
Philosophy has been generally, and
more especially in England and the
United States, in a miserable and
chaotic state until a comparatively
brief period, during which a more
<pb n='232'/><anchor id='Pg232'/>
wholesome tendency has been
awakened. The worst and most
dangerous errors have been those
which have sprung from the sensist
school. As a natural consequence,
those whose Catholic belief has led
them to reject these gross errors,
being unacquainted with the scholastic
philosophy, have been inclined
to throw themselves back on
Platonism, and to welcome any
system of philosophy which put
forward a high ideological doctrine
in which the necessary and eternal
truths, the immutable principles of
first and final cause, the being and
attributes of God, and all natural
theology, were professedly exalted
to their due supremacy, and placed
on a basis unassailable by a mean
scepticism and materialism. The
very same took place in the instance
of Cardinal Gerdil, of Malebranche,
and of others, at a former
period; and F. Ramière, one of the
most successful opponents of ontologism,
has lucidly explained how
this is precisely the reason that the
said system has appeared in a captivating
light, in our own day, to a
number of minds to which scepticism
and materialism are especially
odious. This may explain the fact
that we have taken a more decisive
and explicit stand in regard to several
important philosophical doctrines,
since the more thorough examination
of the differences between
the ancient and received
teaching of Catholic schools, and
the various modern theories, have
convinced us of the great importance
of adhering closely, not only
in respect to the substance of
doctrine, but even in respect to form
and the use of terms, to that philosophy
which has a Catholic sanction.
Within the limits defined by
positive, explicit authority, this adhesion
is, of course, obligatory on
the conscience in the strictest and
gravest sense. In a former article
on Dr. Stöckl's <hi rend='italic'>Philosophy</hi>, we have
explained our position, which is
that of the best and most approved
European authors, in regard to this
obligatory doctrine, so far as relates
to ideology. Beyond this, we respect,
of course, the liberty which
the church concedes. Her positive
sanction has been given to the
scholastic principles, method, and
doctrine, only in general terms.
While, therefore, we advocate the
adhesion to scholastic philosophy,
as the only safe and really scientific
way of procedure in education,
we do not close our eyes to the fact
that there are several important
topics in respect to which discussion
is not only allowable, but really
necessary. The best philosophical
writers living, who are in the main
disciples of S. Thomas, differ very
much from one another in regard
to questions of this sort. Kleutgen,
Liberatore, Sanseverino, Tongiorgi,
Ramière, and Stöckl may be cited
as the most distinguished modern
expositors of the doctrine commonly
taught in Catholic schools; and
the differences among these are well
known. A very able writer, who is
now publishing a series of articles
in this magazine, and who happily
combines a profound knowledge of
mathematics and physics with his
deep metaphysical science, departs,
in some instances, from all these,
and strikes out a path for himself,
in which we are sure that every
philosophical reader will watch his
progress with the greatest interest.
Personally we are disposed to favor
the stricter Thomistic doctrine so
ably elucidated by Liberatore and
Stöckl, and to prefer text-books of
a similar method and doctrine;
yet we should not think we were
authorized to censure as unsound,
<pb n='233'/><anchor id='Pg233'/>
in a theological sense, any philosophical
work, merely because it
might deserve, in our judgment, to
be criticised on purely scientific
grounds, or to condemn as absolutely
unsound, in a purely philosophical
sense, a work essentially
in accordance with the scholastic
system, on account of any particular
opinions of its author on topics of
difference among Catholic teachers
of acknowledged scientific eminence
and authority.
</p>

<p>
We are sorry to be obliged to
say that, in our judgment, F. Louage's
work cannot be exempted by
the most impartial criticism from
either theological or philosophical
censure for radical unsoundness on
most important points, and besides
this, that it cannot stand the test
of even literary criticism, and is,
therefore, wholly unsuitable for use
as a text-book in Catholic schools.
We give the author full credit for
good intentions, and attribute his
failure to accomplish his laudable
undertaking simply to the fact that
he has attempted a very difficult
task, in which very few have
achieved a remarkable success,
without having duly estimated its
arduous nature, and made the requisite
preparation for coping with
the formidable obstacles in the way
of a happy issue.
</p>

<p>
We are bound to sustain the
judgment we have pronounced by
solid proofs and reasons, in view of
the great importance of the subject
to Catholic teachers and pupils,
and this duty we shall now endeavor
to fulfil, in accordance
with the sentiment of the trite old
philosophical adage:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<lg>
<l>Amicus noster Plato</l>
<l>Sed magis amica veritas</l>
</lg>

</quote>

<p>
And, first, we think that the author
has underrated the average
aptitude of our young men for
philosophical studies. We have
not the pleasure of knowing F. Louage's
pupils or their literary attainments;
but we presume that they
are not worse off than the pupils
of other Catholic colleges, where
the philosophical education receives
a far greater development
than his <q>text-book for the use of
schools</q> seems to warrant. We
know, of course, that the literary
instruction hitherto given in the
public schools of this country is
too light and superficial to serve as
a fair preparation for philosophical
pursuits; and we admit that even
our Catholic schools and colleges,
though certainly superior to most
public institutions of a like kind,
may yet complain in some measure
of the same evil; but, notwithstanding
this, we believe that those
among our youths who feel any inclination
to dedicate themselves to
the study of philosophy have sufficient
ability to master ten times as
much of philosophical matter as F.
Louage's text-book contains.
</p>

<p>
A book which pretends to embrace
logic, metaphysics, and ethics
within the narrow compass of
about 220 small pages of clear type
cannot be styled <q>a course of philosophy</q>;
and when it claims to
be <q>designed as a text-book for the
use of schools,</q> it tends to give
abroad a very wrong idea of the
present condition of Catholic education
in America. If our boys cannot
have anything better than the superficial
philosophy the <q>text-book</q>
of the reverend author furnishes,
we would say: Let them forsake
philosophy, and be satisfied with
the <hi rend='italic'>Catechism of the Christian Doctrine</hi>.
Let them remain undisturbed
in their humble simplicity,
and do not foster in them the vain
thought that they are superior to
others, only because they have
<pb n='234'/><anchor id='Pg234'/>
learned by heart a few philosophical
phrases, which they would be
embarrassed to defend, and even to
explain.
</p>

<p>
The London <hi rend='italic'>Tablet</hi>, November
22, 1873, remarks that our author
<q>does not go very deeply into anything.</q>
This remark is true.
Many important philosophical doctrines
are not even mentioned by
him; his book says nothing about
universals, nothing about the essential
constituents of being, nothing
about real and logical distinction,
nothing about simplicity
and composition, nothing about
quantity and quality. We do not
think that any one can aspire to
the honor of being a philosopher
without a clear and distinct knowledge
of these subjects, and of the
many momentous questions connected
with them.
</p>

<p>
Again, the <q>text-book</q> is altogether
silent about creation, its
true notion, its possibility, its reality,
and its final end&mdash;a silence
which is all the more remarkable,
as every one knows how pertinaciously
this Christian and philosophical
dogma is attacked every
day by the adepts of the rationalistic
schools. The <q>text-book</q>
ignores cosmology altogether; and
therefore it does not even allude to
any theory concerning the constitution
of bodies, the nature of matter,
the laws of physical causation,
or the conditions of natural phenomena.
Neither is anything said
in particular about the origin of
the human soul&mdash;a subject concerning
which many ancient and
modern errors should have been
pointed out and refuted; nor anything
about that important truth
that the soul is the form of the
body; nor anything about the
scholastic view of the origin of
ideas&mdash;a view which the author
should not have silently passed
over, but was obliged to refute before
concluding, as he does, in favor
of the exploded ontologistic system.
</p>

<p>
In his theodicy we have sought
in vain for any mention of a positive
conservation of creatures, or
of God's immediate concurrence
with all creatures in their operations.
We only found a few remarks,
altogether unsatisfactory, on
the <q>influence</q> of God over the
free actions of man. The <q>text-book</q>
is equally deficient in ethics,
where the whole discussion about
the ultimate end of man is entirely
forgotten, although it is unquestionably
one of the cardinal points
of moral philosophy. Natural rights
are not even mentioned; habits,
virtues, and passions are likewise
absolutely ignored.
</p>

<p>
We might go on enumerating
other deficiencies of the <q>text-book</q>;
but as we have other
things more important to notice,
we will only point out in general
that scarcely any modern error is
directly impugned, and scarcely
any of the plausible arguments advanced
by modern thinkers against
such capital truths as divine providence,
human liberty, etc., are answered
or even hinted at. We cannot
be surprised, then, that Dr.
Brownson regards this <q>modest
work</q> as <q>simpler and more easily
understood by the English reader
ignorant of Latin and the scholastics</q>
than F. Hill's work. It is
clear that it must be so; for, when
all things difficult are set aside,
what remains must be just as easy
as any <q>reader ignorant of Latin
and the scholastics</q> can desire.
But <q>the fact is,</q> as the London
<hi rend='italic'>Tablet</hi> very wisely observes, <q>that
such books as this are a mistake.
We have had plenty such as this
from France before, their use in
<pb n='235'/><anchor id='Pg235'/>
schools and colleges being pernicious,
as we can testify; because
they create either a slovenly or a
sceptical habit of mind. Either a
lazy student sees difficulties and
questions suggested, and he takes
no trouble to get the things explained
to him, or a clever, active-minded
boy is induced to dub
logic and metaphysics humbug, and
to ruminate on his own imaginings
and wayward reasonings.</q>
</p>

<p>
An elementary course of philosophy,
to be really useful, should be
nothing less than an accurate summary
of some complete standard
work already accepted and recognized
by good philosophical and
theological authorities; so that the
student may know that, in case of
need, he can, by referring to the
latter, solve the doubts and difficulties
now and then arising from
the incompleteness and brevity of
the former. We have many such
courses of philosophy in the Latin
language. They are the work of
patient writers, who carefully collected
and methodically condensed
in their books the learning and the
wisdom of centuries for the benefit
of those who needed an introduction
to the philosophical discipline.
Any student who can make use
of such Latin books perceives,
while going through his course of
philosophy, that he is brought into
constant relation with the most
eminent thinkers of the classical
philosophical ages, knows that
their works are always accessible
to him, and is gratified to think
that their recognized authority affords
him a solid guarantee against
the subreption of fallacious doctrines.
When such conditions as
these are realized, it is evident that
an elementary course of philosophy
may be very useful indeed. But
such is not the case with an English
course of philosophy designed
as a text-book for those who do
not understand Latin. Such a
text-book cannot refer the English
student who knows nothing but
English to other complete and approved
works of philosophy; for we
have none such in our language.
</p>

<p>
It seems to us that before we
can employ a good English text-book
of philosophy for the use of
schools to the best advantage, we
must be provided with a great,
sound, and exhaustive philosophical
work in our own language, to which
the student would refer for all those
questions and difficulties which
cannot be sufficiently explained in
an elementary course. We think
that even F. Hill's English <hi rend='italic'>Elements
of Philosophy</hi>, excellent as it is,
needs to be supplemented by a
higher English philosophical work.
Those of his pupils who cannot
consult the Latin volumes of the
schoolmen may frequently remain
in doubt as to the proper settlement
of many important questions which
their professor did not judge necessary
or possible to examine
thoroughly in his valuable book;
and we have no doubt that all
professors of philosophy will agree
with us that such a great English
work as we suggest&mdash;a very arsenal
of good philosophical weapons&mdash;is
one of the greatest necessities of
our time and of our country. Without
it, all our philosophical efforts
are doomed to be more or less insufficient
and unsuccessful.
</p>

<p>
And now, let us come to another
consideration. If any book needs
to be extremely correct in its expressions
and definitions, surely
elementary text-books for beginners
must be so; for, if the foundation
is wrong, what is built upon it cannot
be right. Now, we are sorry
to say that F. Louage's <hi rend='italic'>Course of
<pb n='236'/><anchor id='Pg236'/>
Philosophy</hi> teems with false notions
and incorrect expressions.
Dr. Brownson openly rejects the
author's definition of <hi rend='italic'>philosophy</hi>, of
<hi rend='italic'>being</hi>, of <hi rend='italic'>existence</hi>, of <hi rend='italic'>possibility</hi>, of
<hi rend='italic'>essence</hi>, of <hi rend='italic'>science</hi>; and in the main
he is evidently right. Yet, while
we admit with Dr. Brownson that
<q>the science of the supersensible</q>
is not a good definition of philosophy,
we do not adopt his own definition,
<q>the science of <hi rend='italic'>principles</hi></q>;
because we know that the true
definition of philosophy is <q>the
science of <hi rend='italic'>things</hi> (supersensible or
not) through their highest principles.</q>
Nor do we agree with him
that F. Louage's definition of <hi rend='italic'>being</hi>&mdash;<q>that
which exists or may exist</q>&mdash;is
incorrect; for, although what
may exist, but does not exist, is no
thing in the real order, yet it is
something in the ideal order, as an
object of thought; and therefore
F. Louage's definition of <hi rend='italic'>being</hi> is
perfectly correct.
</p>

<p>
His definition of possibility, as
<q>the agreement of the attributes
which constitute a being, in such a
way that its existence does not involve
any contradiction,</q> we do
not approve, not exactly for the
reason adduced by Dr. Brownson,
that the non-existent has no attributes,
but because the definition
considers the attributes as <q>constituents</q>
of being (which they are
not), and because the word <q>agreement</q>
should either be replaced
by <q>non-repugnance,</q> or at least
qualified by the epithet <q>intellectual,</q>
referring to the divine intellect,
in which all possibilities are
ideally contained.
</p>

<p>
That <q>the essence of a being
consists of the collection of its
essential attributes,</q> as the author
of the <q>text-book</q> says (p. 7), is
certainly a great error. The attributes
of a being are not the material
components of its essence, nor
do they precede the essence; it is,
on the contrary, from the essence
itself that all the attributes flow.
The essence of any given being is
nothing else than <q>the ratio of a
given act to its term,</q> as has been
clearly established by a writer in
<hi rend='smallcaps'>The Catholic World</hi>, March,
1874, and the attributes of any given
being are nothing else than different
aspects of the actuality of its essence.
</p>

<p>
It is no less erroneous to say that
<q>a genus is a collection of beings
having one or more attributes common
to each</q> (p. 8). This definition
might be admitted in natural
history; but, in philosophy, genus
is not a collection, nor is it conceived
by composition, but by abstraction.
Genus is usually defined to
be <q>a ratio which can be found in
many things, and be predicated of
each of them when an incomplete
answer is given to the question
<hi rend='italic'>What is it?</hi></q> To confound the
universal with the collective is inexcusable,
we think, in a <q>text-book</q>
of philosophy.
</p>

<p>
<q>A species,</q> says the author,
<q>is a collection of beings belonging
to one and the same genus, but
having particular and constitutive
properties</q> (p. 8). Same remark
as above: Species, in philosophy, is
not a collection, but is <q>a ratio
which can be found in many things,
and be predicated of each of them
when a complete answer is given
to the question, <hi rend='italic'>What is it?</hi></q> Species,
like genus, is a universal.
</p>

<p>
<q>Being, the most general genus,
is divided into two species, <hi rend='italic'>corporeal</hi>
and <hi rend='italic'>incorporeal</hi> beings</q> (p. 8).
No philosopher of good reputation
has ever considered being as a
<q>genus.</q> It is known that <q>being</q>
is above all genus, and accordingly
is called <q>transcendental.</q>
<pb n='237'/><anchor id='Pg237'/>
If <q>being</q> were a genus, nothing
could save us from pantheism.
</p>

<p>
<q>Science ... is objective, when
we consider it as existing in the
object contemplated</q> (p. 9). Can
science be considered as existing
in the moon?
</p>

<p>
<q>Art is the application of science
to external things according to determined
rules</q> (p. 9). If so,
then all artists and artisans should
be men of science; which, unhappily,
is not true. Art is usually and
rightly defined as <hi rend='italic'>Recta ratio factibilium</hi>&mdash;<q>a
right method of making
anything</q> with or without the application
of science.
</p>

<p>
<q>Logic is the first part of philosophy&mdash;the
part which treats of the
first efforts of the human mind to
discover truth</q> (p. 17). We think
that apprehension, judgment, and
reasoning, which are the proper
object of logic, are no <emph>efforts</emph> of the
human mind, but very natural and
spontaneous operations.
</p>

<p>
<q>An idea may be considered as
existing either in the mind or out
of it</q> (p. 18). It is very improper
to give the name of <hi rend='italic'>idea</hi> to anything
out of the mind, as words,
gestures, and other outward natural
or conventional signs.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ideas are, first, either true or
false. They are true when they
conform with their objects, false
when they do not. But since this
conformity is always with the objects
as represented in our minds,
and not as they may be in reality,
we may, with this explanation, admit
the opinion of those who pretend
that there are no false ideas</q>
(p. 20). This explanation has no
grounds. Ideas are never compared
with the objects as represented
in our minds. Such a comparison
would have no meaning; for
the object as represented in our
minds is nothing else than a subjective
form identical with the idea
itself. When philosophers say that
<hi rend='italic'>there are no false ideas</hi>, they mean
that ideas always conform to their
object as it shows itself. This is
the common and true doctrine.
Even the author himself, probably
forgetful of what he had said in
this passage, teaches, a few pages
later, that <q>we cannot err in perceiving
or in feeling</q> (p. 23).
</p>

<p>
<q>An idea is distinct when it can
be readily separated from any other
idea, ... and is confused when the
object cannot be distinctly determined</q>
(p. 21). We believe that
ideas are called <q>distinct,</q> not
when they can be readily <emph>separated</emph>
from one another (a thing which
we cannot even conceive), but
when they represent distinctly
their object in all its particulars.
In the contrary case, they are called
<q>confused.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The extension of an idea signifies
the whole collection of the
individuals which the same idea
embraces</q> (p. 21). This is false.
The extension of an idea is the
range of its universality; and we
have already remarked that universality
is not a collection of
individuals. Moreover, it is <emph>comprehension</emph>
that <q>embraces</q> whatever
it comprehends, while extension
embraces nothing, but only
<q>reaches</q> potentially the terms to
which it extends, inasmuch as the
idea is applicable to them.
</p>

<p>
<q>When, in order to form a
species, we collect several individuals
having common properties, we
perform an operation which is called
<hi rend='italic'>generalization</hi></q> (p. 22). This
is very wrong. Generalization,
says Webster, <q>is the act of reducing
particulars to their genera</q>;
and this cannot be done by collecting
individuals, but only by leaving
aside whatever is individual,
<pb n='238'/><anchor id='Pg238'/>
and retaining that which is common.
</p>

<p>
<q>When the mind, after having
compared two ideas, declares their
consistency or their inconsistency,
it makes a judgment</q> (p. 23).
The mind properly compares, not
the ideas themselves, but their
objects as cognized. Two ideas
may be found consistent, and yet
no judgment be made. Thus, I see
that the idea of whiteness is consistent
with the idea of paper; but
does it follow that my mind judges
the paper to be white? Not at all.
It might as well judge the paper to
be green; for the idea of green is
no less consistent with the idea of
paper. It is therefore evident that
the mind in judging does not declare
the consistency or inconsistency
of two ideas, but affirms the
mutual inclusion or exclusion of
two objective terms as apprehended.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing is more obscure or
less useful than such classifications
(of categories)</q> (p. 24). The
author should have been loath to
condemn what all great philosophers
have praised. He might
have considered that classification,
as in all the other sciences, so also
in philosophy, brings clearness,
and that clearness is very useful.
</p>

<p>
<q>Reasoning is said to be immediate
when no comparison is
needed</q> (p. 30). How can there
be reasoning without the comparison
of two terms with a third?
</p>

<p>
<q>Method is that operation of the
mind, etc.</q> (p. 44). Method is the
order followed in the operation;
the operation itself is the <emph>use</emph> of
method.
</p>

<p>
<q>Induction ... is an operation
of the mind inducing us to affirm,
etc.</q> (p. 46). Why <q>inducing us</q>?
It is the conclusion that is induced,
not ourselves.
</p>

<p>
<q>The criterion of certitude is
the sign by which certitude is perfectly
distinguished from error</q>
(p. 52). We remark, that there
are criteria of truth, but not properly
of certitude. Certitude is
the firm adhesion of the mind to
the truth made known to it, and
needs no criterion, because it certifies
itself by its very existence.
The author says that <q>certitude is
at the same time a state and an act
of the mind. As a state, it may be
defined to be a disposition by
which the mind tends to adhere
firmly to the known truth</q> (p. 50).
But this is a great mistake. First,
the <emph>act</emph> of adhering to truth is an
act of judging, not an act of certitude.
Secondly, the <emph>state</emph> of certitude
is not a disposition by which
the mind tends to adhere to
truth. So long as the mind tends
to adhere, there is no adhesion,
and therefore no certitude. Certitude
is the rest of the mind in the
known truth.
</p>

<p>
<q>Reason is a perception</q> (p.
62). It is superfluous to remark
that reason is a faculty, and no
perception is a faculty.
</p>

<p>
<q>Consciousness cannot be deceived,
although it may deceive</q>
(p. 62). How can consciousness
deceive? And if it can deceive,
on what ground does the author immediately
add: <q>Hence consciousness
gives true certitude</q>?
</p>

<p>
<q>The evidence of senses is that
invincible propensity which induces
us to refer our sensations to the
bodies which, according to our
conviction, have been the cause of
them</q> (p. 63). We observe, that
our propensity cannot be our evidence.
Our evidence must be objective,
whilst our propensity is
a subjective disposition. The evidence
of senses is the evident perception
of an object acting on the
<pb n='239'/><anchor id='Pg239'/>
senses. The invincible propensity
is nothing but the necessity of
yielding to that evidence.
</p>

<p>
<q>Common sense is nothing else
than that general knowledge of
first notions or principles which is
found in all men</q> (p. 65). Common
sense, according to Webster,
is that power of the mind which,
by a kind of instinct or a short process
of reasoning, perceives truth,
the relation of things, cause and
effect, etc., and hence enables the
possessor to discern what is right,
useful, or proper, and adopt the
best means to accomplish his purpose.
This definition, or rather
description, is wonderfully correct.
That kind of instinct, in fact, which
the Scotch philosophers wrongly
consider as blind, is really nothing
less than a short process of reasoning,
which carries evidence within
itself. Reasoning, when <emph>formal</emph>&mdash;that
is, when its premises and its
conclusion present themselves distinctly
and in a logical form, as in
the scientific demonstration&mdash;carries
within itself what may be styled
<emph>reflex</emph> evidence; and, when <emph>informal</emph>&mdash;that
is, when the conclusion
and its grounds present themselves
as implied in one another
without assuming the formal shape
of an argument&mdash;it carries within
itself what may be called <emph>direct</emph>
evidence; and because it is in this
second manner that men commonly
acquire their first convictions,
this shorter and informal process
of reasoning is called reasoning of
<hi rend='italic'>common sense</hi>. Accordingly, common
sense is not merely <q>a general
knowledge,</q> but a source of general
knowledge, extending to all
conclusions that are evident but
informal, and especially to moral
dictates, such as <q>Good is to be
done,</q> <q>Evil is to be shunned,</q>
<q>God is to be honored,</q> etc.,
which in fact have ever been
known by the special name of
judgments of common sense&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>sensus
naturæ communis</foreign>.
</p>

<p>
<q>The laws of nature, considered
individually, are contingent</q> (p.
76). Would they cease to be contingent
if they were not considered
individually?
</p>

<p>
<q>Metaphysics literally means
<hi rend='italic'>above nature</hi>, and nature here signifies
the material world</q> (p. 81).
These two assertions do not agree
with the common notion of metaphysics,
and have been refuted in
<hi rend='smallcaps'>The Catholic World</hi> for December,
1873.
</p>

<p>
<q>Special metaphysics has been
called <hi rend='italic'>pneumatology</hi></q> (p. 81). Pneumatology
is only a part of special
metaphysics. Every one knows
that cosmology and anthropology
belong to special metaphysics no
less than natural theology.
</p>

<p>
<q>In this dissertation (ontology)
we consider being as abstracted
from existence</q> (p. 81). Ontology
does not consider being as abstracted
from existence, but considers
being as such, and therefore
as existing either in the order of
things, or at least in the order of
ideas. It is as impossible to conceive
being as abstracted from existence
as to conceive a circle as
abstracted from rotundity.
</p>

<p>
<q>Some existence must have existed
before any possibility</q> (p.
84). We do not like the expression
<q>existence exists,</q> as we
would not like this other, <q>velocity
runs.</q> Moreover, possibilities are
co-eternal with God; it is therefore
incorrect to say that some existence
must have existed <emph>before</emph>
them.
</p>

<p>
<q>Principle is that which contains
the reason for the existence
of something.... Cause is that
which produces something, or which
<pb n='240'/><anchor id='Pg240'/>
concurs in the production of
something</q> (p. 85). These definitions
are very vague and unsatisfactory,
to say the least.
</p>

<p>
<q>The condition is the difficulty
to be conquered in order to obtain
the effect</q> (p. 86). By no means.
Is the presence of the object a difficulty
to be conquered in order to
see it?
</p>

<p>
<q>The end ... has been improperly
called the final cause</q>
(p. 87). Why <q>improperly</q>?
</p>

<p>
<q>Modification ... is the substance
appearing to us with such
or such determined form</q> (p. 89).
Quite absurd. Modification is not
the substance, but the accidental
form itself, no matter whether appearing
or not appearing to us.
</p>

<p>
<q>Modification cannot exist without
substance, nor substance without
modification</q> (p. 90). This proposition
is too universal. Would
the author admit modifications in
the divine substance?
</p>

<p>
<q>Some authors divide infinite
into the infinite <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>actu</foreign>, or the actual
infinite, ... and the infinite <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>potentia</foreign>,
or the potential or virtual
infinite, which can be infinitely
increased or diminished. But certainly
this division cannot be accepted,
since the infinite and a
substance which can be increased
are two terms involving contradiction</q>
(p. 91). What the author
calls <q>some authors</q> are all the
schoolmen. We put to him the
following question: Will the human
soul have a finite or an infinite
duration? If finite, it must
have an end; but, if it has no end,
it cannot but be the contradictory
of finite&mdash;that is, infinite. Yet this
infinite duration is successive; it is
therefore not actually, but potentially,
infinite. Hence the division
of the schoolmen can and must be
accepted. The author thinks that
the potential infinite is not infinite,
but indefinite; but surely what has
no end is infinite, not indefinite,
although it is conceived by us indefinitely,
because it transcends
our comprehension. The indefinite
is not that which has no end,
but that of which the end remains
undetermined.
</p>

<p>
<q>That we have in our mind the
idea of the infinite is certain....
Evidently it has been placed in our
mind by God himself, since the
finite could not give the idea of
the infinite</q> (p. 91, 92). We undoubtedly
have a notion of the infinite;
but the author gratuitously
assumes that this notion is an <emph>idea</emph>
placed in our minds from without,
while the fact is that such a notion
is not an <emph>idea</emph>, but a <emph>concept</emph> of our
mind, or a result of intellectual
operation. Of course, the finite
cannot give us the <emph>idea</emph> of the infinite;
but from the finite we can,
and we do, form a <emph>concept</emph> of the
infinite. This is the true and common
doctrine. We cannot undertake
to give in this place a refutation
of ontologism; we only remark
that the ontologistic theory
is so generally repudiated that it
should not find a place in a text-book
for the use of schools.
</p>

<p>
<q>A material being is one which
is essentially extensive and inert</q>
(p. 92). If so, how can the author
consider as <q>more acceptable</q>
the view of Leibnitz, that <q>a monad
is essentially unextensive</q>?
(p. 93).
</p>

<p>
<q>Spiritual substance is quadruple&mdash;namely,
God, the angels, the
human soul, and the soul of the
beasts</q> (p. 93). The soul of the
beasts <emph>spiritual</emph>!&mdash;a nice doctrine
indeed for the use of schools.
Nor is this an oversight of the author;
for we find that he endows
beasts with <emph>intellect</emph> also (p. 170).
<pb n='241'/><anchor id='Pg241'/>
What shall we say, but that we live
in an age of progress?
</p>

<p>
<q>The properties of a being are
those parts which constitute the
being</q> (p. 93). We have already
observed that the being is constituted
by its principles, and not by
its properties.
</p>

<p>
<q>A being is true when it agrees
with its own attributes</q> (p. 94).
It would be more philosophical to
say that a being is true when its
constituent principles agree with
one another.
</p>

<p>
<q>A bad action or a sin is something
merely negative</q> (p. 95).
False. The physical action is positive,
and its sinfulness is not a
negation, but a <hi rend='italic'>privation</hi>, as theologians
know.
</p>

<p>
<q>We may define relation, in general,
to be a property pertaining to a
being when compared with another
being</q> (p. 95). This is a wrong
definition. Relation can hardly be
called a property. Distance and
time are relations; yet no one
would dream of calling them <hi rend='italic'>properties</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<q>Identity is the perseverance of
a being in the same state</q> (p. 96).
The author should have said <q>in
the same entity</q>; for a mere
change of state does not destroy
identity.
</p>

<p>
<q>Space is virtually (<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>potentia</foreign>) infinite,
using the word infinite, as we
have before explained, in the sense
of indefinite. It is also immense
and infinitely divisible</q> (p. 97).
The author might have considered
that immensity is infinity; and
therefore, if space is immense, it is
infinite, and not indefinite.
</p>

<p>
<q>Time is the duration of a being,
or the permanence of its existence</q>
(p. 97). Without successivity there
is no time; and therefore the definition
of time given by the author
is essentially defective.
</p>

<p>
<q>Duration without an end ...
is the same as immortality</q> (p. 98).
If the earth is to last without an
end, shall we call it immortal?
</p>

<p>
<q>Perfections are modifications
of beings</q> (p. 107). This proposition,
as understood by the author,
who extends it to all the perfections
of contingent beings, is evidently
false.
</p>

<p>
<q>The Scotists teach that there is
a real distinction among God's attributes</q>
(p. 115). By no means.
The Scotists would never have
taught such a gross error. They
taught that the distinction between
God's absolute attributes was a
<hi rend='italic'>formal</hi>, and not a <hi rend='italic'>real</hi>, distinction.
</p>

<p>
<q>For God, the interior acts are
those whose object is himself</q> (p.
123). There are not many interior
acts in God, as the author implies,
but one permanent act only.
</p>

<p>
<q>It appears difficult to reconcile
the immutability of God with his
liberty. Three systems have been
formed for this purpose, but they
are not satisfactory</q> (p. 124). If the
author had considered that God's
liberty is all <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ad extra</foreign>, and not <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ad intra</foreign>,
he would have seen that he had
no right to qualify as he does the
theological solution of the present
difficulty. Each of the three solutions
is satisfactory, at least in this
sense: that each of them sets at
naught the objections of the opponents.
This is all we need. As to
which of the three solutions is the
best, it is not our duty to decide.
</p>

<p>
<q>Immensity means the same as
omnipresence</q> (p. 130). This is
not true. Omnipresence is relative,
and its range is measured by the
actual existence of creatures, as it
does not extend beyond creation;
while immensity is absolute, and
transcends all created things.
</p>

<p>
<q>S. Thomas says that God also
sees future free and contingent
<pb n='242'/><anchor id='Pg242'/>
things in their essence&mdash;that is, that
he sees them in his eternal and immutable
decrees</q> (p. 133). Does
the author mean that S. Thomas
considers the essence of contingent
things as equivalent to the eternal
and immutable decrees?
</p>

<p>
<q>But Molina and his disciples
contend that with such a system (S.
Thomas's) it is impossible to defend
human liberty</q> (p. 133). Here Molina
and his disciples are represented
as the decided adversaries
of the Angelic Doctor. It is not
fair. The author should have remembered
that S. Thomas's doctrine
is variously explained by various
writers, and that it is possible to
be a follower of S. Thomas without
being a <hi rend='italic'>Thomist</hi> in the usual sense
given to this word.
</p>

<p>
<q>Veracity consists in this: that a
being can neither deceive nor be
deceived</q> (p. 134). Shall we deny
the author's veracity because he has
been sometimes deceived?
</p>

<p>
<q>Justice is the attribute according
to which we give to others what
belongs to them</q> (p. 135). Justice
with us is a virtue, not an attribute;
with God, justice is an attribute, but
does not consist in giving to others
what <emph>belongs</emph> to them; it consists in
giving to others what the order of
reason demands.
</p>

<p>
<q>Providence is, therefore, a continuous
creation</q> (p. 137). The
mistake is evident. It is conservation,
not providence, that is thus
defined.
</p>

<p>
<q>The action of God upon us
during life is constant, and this is
what we mean by his providence</q>
(p. 137). This is another mistake.
The author confounds the notion
of providence with that of <hi rend='italic'>concursus</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<q>In regard to its wrong use (of
liberty), God cannot have an immediate,
but only a mediate, influence
on man's actions, in the sense that
he has granted liberty of which a
bad use is made against his suggestions.
His sanctity forbids that
he should act immediately in that
case</q> (p. 138). Not at all. God
<emph>immediately</emph> concurs to all our actions,
whether good or bad, as every
theologian knows, inasmuch as they
are physical actions; and concurs
neither immediately nor mediately
to their badness, because their badness
is nothing but a privation, and
therefore requires no efficient
cause.
</p>

<p>
The author misrepresents (pp.
138, 139) the doctrine of the Molinists
concerning the influence (<hi rend='italic'>concursus</hi>)
of God upon our actions.
He says that this influence, according
to the Molinists, <q>is positive
and direct, but <hi rend='italic'>not on our will</hi>,</q> and
<q>consists in affording a concourse
of circumstances the most suitable
for the determination.</q> The
author may have found this interpretation
of Molina's doctrine in
some old book; but it is known
that the Molinists have always admitted
God's influence <q>on our
will,</q> though they never admitted
the physical predetermination; and
it is no less certain that none of
them maintain that <q>a concourse
of circumstances</q> suffices to explain
God's influence on our free
actions.
</p>

<p>
We are afraid that the reader
must be tired of following us in this
enumeration of philosophical, theological,
and historical mistakes, and
we ourselves are tired of our irksome
task. Indeed, the psychology
and the ethics of our author are
open to as much criticism as the
rest of the work; but what we have
said abundantly suffices to justify
our opinion that F. Louage's text-book
has no claim to adoption in
Catholic schools. Accordingly, we
<pb n='243'/><anchor id='Pg243'/>
shall omit the detailed examination
of the last 86 pages of his work.
But we cannot conceal the fact that
we have been much surprised and
pained at the open profession of
ontologism made by the author in
his article <q>On the Nature and Origin
of our Ideas.</q> That Dr. Brownson,
in his <hi rend='italic'>Review</hi>, should try to show
that <emph>his own</emph> ontologism can be philosophically
defended and does not
fall under ecclesiastical condemnation,
we do not wonder. He is
not a priest; he does not write
for school-boys, but addresses himself
to educated men, who can sift
his arguments, and dismiss with
a benign smile what they think to
be unsound; and, after all, he takes
great care to screen himself behind
a newly invented distinction between
ideal intuition, and perception
or cognition, based on the assumption,
honestly maintained by
him, that <q>intuition is the act of
the object, not of the subject.</q> But
with our <q>text-book</q> the case is
very different. F. Louage makes
no distinctions, and takes no precautions.
He declares unconditionally
that <q>God is present to our intellect,
and seen by it,</q> and that
<q>all rational ideas come into the
mind <hi rend='italic'>by the intuitive perception</hi> of
the simple being, or of God,</q> and
that, <q>in a word, all rational ideas,
after all, are <hi rend='italic'>nothing else</hi> than the
idea of the simple being (<hi rend='italic'>God</hi>) considered
in itself</q> (p. 156). Can the
author be ignorant that this doctrine
coincides with the doctrine which,
on the 18th of September, 1861,
the Roman Congregation of the
Holy Inquisition has declared to be
untenable (<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>tuto tradi non posse</foreign>)?
The reverend author believes that
<q>this doctrine has been held by S.
Augustine, S. Anselm, S. Bonaventure,
Bossuet, and many others</q>;
but we doubt whether this fact, even
if it were well established, would
afford him sufficient protection
against the Roman declaration.
We presume, in fact, that S. Augustine,
S. Anselm, etc., are better
known and understood in Rome
than in America. But, waiving all
discussion on the subject, we cannot
but repeat that a text-book for
Catholic schools must not teach as
<q><emph>the</emph> true doctrine,</q> and not even
as a probable doctrine, what the
Catholic Church shuns as unsound,
unsafe, and untenable. This <q>true
doctrine,</q> nevertheless, he says, is
<q>a mere hypothesis</q>!
</p>

<p>
And here we stop. We have
given sixty passages of F. Louage's
book, by which it is manifest that
his course of philosophy is as sadly
deficient in philosophical accuracy
as it is glaringly incomplete in its
survey of the philosophical topics.
It is to be regretted that a man of
his facility in writing has not devoted
himself to some subject more
congenial to his talents. Such
books as this are a mistake. A
philosophy which is not precise in
its definitions nor deep in its bearings
can only do harm. Such a
philosophy will certainly not enable
the young student successfully to
uphold truth, nor make him proof
against sophistry, nor afford him
any guidance whatever in after-life.
It will, on the contrary, lay him
open to temptation and seduction,
as it will open his eyes to many objections
which he has not the power
to solve. Indeed, unpretending
common sense is safer for individuals
and for nations than a superficial
philosophical training. A sad
experience shows this to be a fact.
It was shallow philosophy that most
powerfully aided the spread of rationalism
and infidelity in France,
Germany, and other European nations.
America needs no such thing.
</p>

<pb n='244'/><anchor id='Pg244'/>

<p>
We need thorough and comprehensive
philosophical teaching in accordance
with the tradition of the
schools which have been formed
and directed by the highest ecclesiastical
authority, and which shall
be conducted by men thoroughly
competent for the task. The only
fruit our youth can gather from any
other system will be noxious in its
effects both on their minds and
their morals. Yet, as we cannot
remain idly waiting and doing nothing
until the perfect system of
education descends from heaven,
we cannot dismiss this important
matter without a few more remarks
upon the practical course to be
pursued under our present disadvantages.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, we renew our
recommendation of F. Hill's text-book
for all classes which cannot
make use of a Latin manual, and
are capable of understanding the
above-mentioned treatise. Professors
who understand the Latin language
can prepare themselves to
elucidate and supplement the text
by their own lectures and explanations.
Those who read French
will find in the translation of F.
Kleutgen's <hi rend='italic'>Philosophie der Vorzeit</hi>
into that language an exposition of
scholastic philosophy, with a refutation
of modern errors, which will
be of the greatest utility. Those
who read German are referred to
the works of Dr. Stöckl, and those
who read Italian to San Severino<note place='foot'>The principal work of this author is in
Latin. We believe that some of his treatises are
in Italian. There are similar works noticed in
the <hi rend='italic'>Civilta Cattolica</hi>.</note>
and the admirable treatise of Liberatore&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Della
Conoscenza Intellettuale</hi>.
It is a pity that these works
of Kleutgen and Liberatore could
not be at once translated into English,
while we are waiting for the
coming man who will give us a
great original work. The Catholic
Unions which are so devotedly
pursuing <q>studies</q> in respect to
education, or some other society of
young men anxious to promote
their own intellectual culture, could
not do better than to provide for
the necessary expense of making
and publishing these and similar
translations. The English language
is poorly provided with
works of this kind. If the study
of Latin must be excluded from
the education of so many of our intelligent
and cultured young men,
or so superficially pursued as to be
practically useless, it cannot be too
earnestly recommended to them to
learn the French, German, and Italian
languages, or at least one or
two of them, that they may have
access to their rich and abundant
stores of Catholic literature, contained
not only in books, but in the
periodicals, which are conducted
with an ability and extended over
a range of subjects far beyond what
our own have yet attained. This
last remark applies especially to the
French periodicals. The best works
ought, however, to be translated
into English, and the only obstacle
to this desirable work is the expense,
which at present effectually
hinders its being done, except for
very popular and salable books.
</p>

<p>
Something ought to be done to
enable young men who discover at
a later period, when they are already
engaged in the business of life, the
defects of their education, to supply
these in some way. The manly
and sensible letter of the alumni
of the Dublin Catholic University
to the Irish bishops expresses a
want felt not only by young men
in Ireland, but also in England and
America. These young Irishmen
point out two notable defects in
their collegiate instruction&mdash;a defect
<pb n='245'/><anchor id='Pg245'/>
of instruction in physical science,
and a defect of instruction in the
science of Catholic doctrine. The
Irish bishops, and the English
bishops also, are beginning energetic
and wise measures for the improvement
of higher education for
Catholic young men. At present,
there seems no immediate prospect
of similar measures being undertaken
in this country; but, as a
practical substitute, we venture to
suggest to Catholic Unions and other
societies that courses of lectures
would partly supply that lack, which
is felt by so many, of the more regular
and systematic instruction
which they did not receive at college.
</p>

<p>
In respect to the actual instruction
at present given in schools,
there remains one other important
point to be noticed. It is a regular
part of the plan of study in our
academies for young ladies, to give
them lessons in philosophy during
the last two years of their course.
After a short course of pure logic,
which presents no special difficulty,
the pupils of the academies under
the Ladies of the Sacred Heart&mdash;which
may be taken as a specimen,
we suppose, of other schools of
similar grade&mdash;have two lessons a
week in what is called <q>mental
philosophy,</q> and another lesson in
ethics, during two years. The early
age at which the pupils graduate,
which is usually about the completion
of their eighteenth year, and
the many branches of study they
are expected to pursue, make it
impossible to give more time to
these lessons. F. Hill's text-book
seems to be too difficult for use in
these schools under the present
circumstances. Some might think
it would be better to drop the study
of philosophy altogether in young
ladies' schools, and cite in their
own favor what we have said above
of the mischief of superficial instruction
in this science. But, in
the first place, if we were to give
this counsel, there is no probability
that it would be followed; and
our own acquaintance with the intellectual
condition and wants of
this very interesting and important
class of young people induces us to
think, that they cannot be relegated
entirely to the catechism class, and
really require instruction in these
higher branches of mental and moral
science. We would like to see the
experiment of using F. Hill's <hi rend='italic'>Philosophy</hi>
fairly tried with these classes,
before it is rejected as too difficult.
If an easier one is found to
be necessary, the only thing to be
done is to try to make such a text-book,
which shall be solid, accurate,
sufficiently comprehensive, and yet
written with a lucidity of style and
explained with an appositeness of
illustration, by examples, which will
make it intelligible both to the
teachers and the pupils. A difficult
task, certainly, and requiring a
very unusual combination of high
intellectual capacity and science
with tact and skill in the adaptation
of style and manner to the
condition of the juvenile mind. Yet
is it not equally difficult to make a
good catechism? If it is feasible
to produce such a text-book, we
think there are classes of boys for
whom it would be as useful as for
female pupils. There are unquestionably
women, as well as men,
who need and are capable of a
much higher intellectual discipline
than that which is possible for the
generality; but we see no way for
such persons to obtain what they
desire, except by their own private
reading, aided by the advice of a
learned and judicious counsellor,
unless some change were made in
<pb n='246'/><anchor id='Pg246'/>
the present system by providing
a longer course and more advanced
instruction for a select class of
pupils.
</p>

<p>
This leads us to remark that the
religious women who are dedicated
to the work of higher instruction
need themselves better preparation
for their elevated and important
task than they can at present receive
in convents. Beyond their
previous education in the convent-school,
which prepares them only to
give what they have received, they
can at present proceed no further,
except by private study, for which
both time and proper books are
lacking. Lectures by learned
priests, which advanced pupils
might attend, would be the most
effectual means of giving this training.
And as the principal object
of these higher studies is not a
mere intellectual culture, but education
in the principles and doctrines
of the Catholic religion, there
is need of more thorough doctrinal,
and we might even say <hi rend='italic'>theological</hi>
instruction in convent-schools, from
priests who can devote a large part
of their time and labor to a truly
pastoral care of this choice and
precious portion of Christ's flock&mdash;religious
women and the young
girls under their maternal care.
There are many things to be
amended and improved in all departments
of Catholic education.

By The Author Of <q>The House of Yorke.</q>
</p>

<p>
One of the greatest severities in
the imprisonment of a criminal is,
probably, that he can no longer see
the wide earth nor the free skies,
so that not only is his body cramped,
but his mind is thrown back on
itself, and forbidden to send out
those long tendrils which can
sometimes shoot through the eyes,
and fasten on distant objects, when
those near by are repelling. Moreover,
the universe itself becomes to
him like another prisoner, and he
can scarcely believe that the large,
smooth creation sails uninterruptedly
on its way when he sees of it but
one little spot for ever shut in by
the bars of his cell.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger's window in the
jail had been low, giving him a
sight of the street not far away; but
his cell in the prison was higher up,
and separated from the window by
a passage. Sitting or lying down,
therefore, he saw only a small square
of sky; and standing, the topmost
line of a blue hill became visible.
Only one other earthly object was
in sight; and as time passed by
that became still less and less of
earth, and assumed a variable but
always supernatural character: it
was the stone Christ that stood on
the church not far away. He could
see all of it but the lowest hem of
the robe; and as it stood there,
surrounded by air alone, above the
narrow line of the distant hill, it
seemed an awful colossal being
walking in over the edge of a submerged
world. At morning, when
the sky was bright behind it, it
darkened, the lineaments of the
face were lost in a shadow that was
like a frown, and its garments and
its hands were full of gloom. At
one season there were a few days
when the risen sun at a certain hour
surrounded the head with an intolerable
splendor, and then it was
an image of wrath and judgment.
It wore quite another character on
bright evenings, when, the setting
sun shining in its face, it came,
white and glowing, down the hillside,
with arms outstretched, full
of irresistible love and invitation.
To see this image, he had to stand
at the grated door of his cell.
When sitting or lying down, there
was no view for the prisoner but a
square of sky barred off by iron
rods; and as the earth rolled, his
view travelled with it, day after
day going over the same track in
the terrestrial sphere. At evening
a few pale stars went by, afar off,
and so unaware of him that they
were like distant sails to the shipwrecked
mariner, hovering on the
horizon and disappearing, each
failure a new shipwreck to him.
</p>

<p>
One morning, when he opened
his eyes just as day was beginning
to flicker in the east, he saw a large,
full star, so brilliant that it trembled
in the silvery sky, as if about to
spill its brimming gold. It was so
alive, so intelligent, so joyous, that
he raised himself and looked at it
<pb n='248'/><anchor id='Pg248'/>
as he would have looked at a fair
and joyful face appearing at the
door of his cell. Surely it was
like good tidings, that glad star in
the east! He got up, and, as he
rose, there rose up whitely against
the sky the Christ of the Immaculate
Conception, seeming almost
transparent in that pure light.
</p>

<p>
The prisoner knelt on the stone
floor of his cell, and lifted his hands.
<q>God of my fathers,</q> he said, <q>deliver
me! for I am turned in my
anguish whilst the thorn is fastened!</q>
</p>

<p>
It was the first prayer he had uttered
since the night of his arrest,
except those outcries which were
more the expression of anger and
a devouring impatience than of petition.
Having uttered it, he lay
down again, and tried to sleep.
He dreaded the thronging thoughts
and tormenting pains of the day,
and there was a tender sweetness
in this new mood which he would
fain have kept and carried off into
sleep. To keep it by him, he called
up that story suggested by what
he had just seen, the star in the
east and the Christ. He did not
believe it, but he found it soothing.
It came to him like David's song
to Saul, and, though but a mythical
story, as that was but a song, it
kept down the tigers of anger and
despair which threatened to rise
and tear him.
</p>

<p>
It was his own Judæa, which he
had never seen, indeed, but which
was to him what the fountain is to
the stream&mdash;the source of his being.
How fair and peaceful was that
silent night that overhung, unbarred
by iron bolts, free from horizon
to horizon! The holy city
was sleeping, and by its side slept
Bethlehem. Within a stable a fair
young matron had just laid her
newly-born child on its bed of
straw, while Joseph, his Jewish
brother, ministered to both, feeling
sad and troubled, it must be,
that those so dear to him were so
illy cared for at such a time.
The ox and the ass looked on with
large, mild eyes, and warmed the
air with their breath. It was poor,
but how peaceful, how tender, how
free! The open door and windows
of that poor stable were to
him more beautiful than the barred
and guarded portal of a Herod or a
Cæsar.
</p>

<p>
Yet with what a blaze of glory
the Christian church had surrounded
this simple human picture!
The poor man who had been able
to give his family no better shelter
than a stable was held by them
more honored than Herod or
Cæsar; and cherubim, bright and
warm from heaven, like coals just
from a fire, drew near to gaze with
him, and burned with a still white
light above his head. They called
this matron a miraculous mother,
they showered titles over her like
flowers and gems, they placed the
moon beneath her feet, and wreathed
the stars of heaven into a garland
for her head.
</p>

<p>
How terrible and how beautiful
was this Christian legend! The
Jew had abhorred it as a blasphemy,
and his blood chilled as he
suffered his thought to touch one
instant the awful centre of this
strange group&mdash;the Babe to whose
small hand these idolaters gave
the power to crush the universe,
on whose tiny head they placed the
crown of omnipotence. It was
useless to try to sleep. The soothing
human picture had blazed out
with such an awakening supernatural
glory that he could not even
lie still. He rose again, and stood
at the door of his cell. The star
had melted from sight, the peaceful,
<pb n='249'/><anchor id='Pg249'/>
cloudless morning was spreading
over the sky, and where the
feet of the Christ stood on the hill-top
the beams of the sun were
sparkling. Beautiful upon the
mountains were the feet of Him
who brought good tidings.
</p>

<p>
<q>A Christian would call it miraculous,</q>
he muttered, looking at
that light; and he shuddered as he
spoke. But that shudder did not
come from the depths of his soul,
where a new light and peace were
brooding. It was like the clamor
and confusion outside the doors of
the temple when the Lord had
driven forth the money-changers,
and was less an expression of abhorrence
than a casting out of abhorrence.
</p>

<p>
The Jew did not know that,
however, nor guess nor inquire
what had happened in his soul.
He scarcely thought at all, but
stood there and let the light steep
him through. Some dim sense of
harmony stole over him, as if he
heard a smooth and noble strain
of music, and for the first time
since his imprisonment he remembered
his loved profession, and
longed to feel the keys of a piano
or an organ beneath his hand.
His fingers unconsciously played
on the iron bars, and he hummed
a tune lowly to himself, without
knowing what it was.
</p>

<p>
<q>How beautiful upon the mountains
are the feet of Him that
bringeth good tidings, that publisheth
peace!</q>
</p>

<p>
Then, catching himself idle and
dreaming, he turned away from the
grating, took a book from the
table, and began to read.
</p>

<p>
This book had been to Mr.
Schöninger an intellectual substitute
for that spiritual consolation which
he had not. Finding early in his
imprisonment that his mind was
working itself into a frenzy over
the horrors of his position, and injuring
him physically more even
than confinement did, he had begun
the study of a language with which
he was entirely unacquainted, and,
whenever he found his thoughts
accomplishing nothing profitable,
he turned them resolutely to this
study, and bent them, with the
whole force of his will, to learning
dry rules and regulations. The
discipline had saved him much, but
it had not prevented his growing
thin and haggard, and loathing food,
and almost forgetting how to sleep.
</p>

<p>
But on this morning study did
not seem so much a refuge as a
task. The prisoner lifted his eyes
now and then from the book, and
looked outward to the sky, and
then dropped them again, still in
a dream, and wondering at himself.
So might the sea have wondered
when its waves sank to rest
beneath the divine feet of the Lord
passing over.
</p>

<p>
How many times during those
terrible months he had striven to
produce a perfect calm in his own
soul by calling up stoical thoughts,
and all in vain; or, if not in vain,
the only effect had been a temporary
and enforced calm.
</p>

<p>
Nor was it unworthy a manly
and reasonable character that such
an effect as he now experienced
should be produced by something
which, apparently, appealed only
to the artistic or the marvellous.
Every soul has its beautiful gate;
and if truth, walking about outside,
should choose to enter by that
vine-wreathed portal, and reach
the citadel by way of gardens and
labyrinths, instead of approaching
by the broad avenue of reason,
who shall say that it is not as well?
Besides, in the artist, that gate
stands always open.

<p>
It was those same sunbeams,
shining on the hill-top, and speaking
to the lonely prisoner of a
dawn of hope and joy, which to
Annette Gerald's eyes had flashed
like the two-edged sword by whose
lightnings the first sinners in the
world had fled out into the desert.
But this sorrowful daughter
of Eve missed one of the consolations
of our first mother; for Eve
could lament aloud, and call on all
creation to weep with her; but this
later exile must take up her misery
as if it were a delight.
</p>

<p>
She went about smilingly, making
preparations for this little journey
she had announced her intention
of taking.
</p>

<p>
<q>But you needn't put everything
in order, just as if you were never
coming back again,</q> her mother
said. <q>I'll see to things.</q>
</p>

<p>
She was sitting in Annette's
chamber, and watching her at work.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, mamma, just as you
please,</q> the daughter answered
gently, and touched her mother
caressingly on the shoulder in passing.
</p>

<p>
A lock of Mrs. Ferrier's dark hair
had fallen from the comb, and was
hanging down her back. Annette
paused to fasten it up, and, as she
did so, caught quickly a pair of
scissors near, and severed a little
tress.
</p>

<p>
<q>What in the world are you cutting
my hair for?</q> exclaimed Mrs.
Ferrier, who had witnessed the
operation in a looking-glass opposite.
</p>

<p>
Annette laughed and blushed.
She had not meant to be detected.
<q>I'll tell you when I come back,
mamma. You shall see what I am
going to have made. It will be
something very wonderful.</q>
</p>

<p>
She turned quickly away, and
bit her lip hard to keep down some
rising emotion. She had seen a
single thread of silver in that dark-brown
tress, and the sight, touching
at all times&mdash;the mother's first
gray hair&mdash;brought with it the poignant
thought that white hairs
would come fast and thick when
her mother should know what this
journey meant.
</p>

<p>
<q>What are you taking all those
common dresses for?</q> Mrs. Ferrier
asked. <q>They are hardly fit
to go to the mountains with.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! we do not mean to be
gay and fashionable,</q> was the light
reply. <q>We want to have a quiet
time by ourselves.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you have got your jewel-case,</q>
the mother persisted. <q>I
don't see what you want of diamonds
with a shabby black silk
gown.</q>
</p>

<p>
In spite of the almost intolerable
thought that after these few
hours she would probably never
see her mother again, Annette
found this oversight irritating. Yet
not for anything would she have
spoken one word that was not dictated
by respect and affection.
The only way was to escape now,
and make her preparations afterward,
and for that she had an excuse.
</p>

<p>
<q>By the way, mamma,</q> she said,
<q>I want to see F. Chevreuse, and
this is just the hour to catch him
at home. Won't you take your
drive now, and leave me at his
house? Wouldn't you just as lief
go out before lunch as after? You
and I haven't had a drive together
for a long time.</q>
</p>

<p>
And then, when she was alone,
she made haste to put into her
trunks all those common, useful
articles which fitted her present
needs, and the few souvenirs too
dear to leave behind, and the valuables,
which might some day be
<pb n='251'/><anchor id='Pg251'/>
sold, if money should fail them.
She had scarcely turned the key
on them, when her mother came in
again, pulling on her gloves. <q>I
want to speak to F. Chevreuse
myself,</q> she remarked, <q>and I will
go in with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Annette said nothing, but dressed
herself hastily. It really seemed
as though every obstacle were
being placed in her way; yet how
could she be impatient with her
poor mother, whose heart was so
soon to be smitten, through her, by
a terrible grief, and who would
soon recall in bitterness of soul
every word and act of this their
last day together? And, after all,
she had no desire to talk with the
priest. What could she say to
him? All that was necessary was
written, and she could not ask his
blessing nor any service from him,
nor even his forgiveness. The one
thing he could do for them was to
denounce them, set the officers of
justice on their track, and make
their lot worse than that of Cain,
since the earth was no longer wide
and wild, but close and full of
watching eyes and prating tongues.
The world seemed to her, indeed,
oppressively small, having no least
nook where the restless, curious
traveller did not penetrate with
his merciless pen, for ever ready to
sketch all he heard and saw to
gratify the equally restless and
curious people at home.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it a confession you have to
make?</q> Mrs Ferrier asked, as they
approached the priest's house.
</p>

<p>
They had been driving along in
silence, and at this question Annette
started and blushed violently.
<q>Dear me, mamma!</q> she said, in
answer to her mother's look of
astonishment, <q>I was off a thousand
miles, and you gave me such
a start when you spoke. Yes, it
is a confession. You can see F.
Chevreuse first, and I will go in
after. You need not wait for me.
I am going to walk out to the convent
to Sister Cecilia a few minutes.
The walk will do me good;
and afterward I would like to
have you send the carriage there
for me.</q>
</p>

<p>
The excitement under which she
was laboring led her unconsciously
to assume a decided and almost
commanding tone, and her mother
submitted without any opposition.
Annette certainly did not look
well, she thought; and, besides,
she was going away. This last
consideration was one of great
weight with Mrs. Ferrier, for she
looked on railroads and steam-boats
as infernal contrivances expressly
intended to destroy human
life, and never saw persons in
whom she was interested commit
themselves to the mercies of
these inventions without entertaining
mournful apprehensions as to
the probable result. Moreover,
Annette had been very sweet and
fond with her all day, and was
looking very beautiful, with that
wide-awake glance of her bright
eyes, and the crimson color flickering
like a flame in her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
<q>I think, dear, on the whole, I
won't go in to-day,</q> she said.
<q>It might take too long; for this
is his busy time of day. To-morrow
will do as well.</q>
</p>

<p>
Annette only nodded, unable to
speak; but in stepping from the
carriage, she laid her small hand
on Mrs. Ferrier's, and gave it a
gentle pressure.
</p>

<p>
<q>That girl grows prettier and
sweeter every day,</q> said the mother
to herself, as her daughter disappeared
within the doorway. <q>And
how black velvet does become
her!</q>
</p>

<pb n='252'/><anchor id='Pg252'/>

<p>
Father Chevreuse knew well that
no ordinary errand could have
brought Annette Gerald to his
house, and it was impossible for
him to meet her with the ordinary
forms of civility. Scarcely any
greeting passed between them, as
he rose hastily at her entrance, and
waited for her first word. She was,
perhaps, more collected than he.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you quite alone here?</q>
she asked.
</p>

<p>
He led her to the inner sitting-room,
and closed the door after
them, and even then did not think
to offer her a chair any more than
she thought of taking one.
</p>

<p>
<q>We have told mamma that we
are going away this evening for a
little journey, and she expects us
to return in four weeks. John
knows all about our affairs. At
the end of four weeks, he will say
something to you, or you to him,
whichever you please, and at that
time you will open and use this
packet.</q> She gave him an envelope
carefully sealed, with the date at
which it was to be opened written
on the outside. <q>If anything
should happen to you in the meantime,
some one else must open it;
but care must be used not to have
it read before the time.</q> She
paused for an answer.
</p>

<p>
<q>You need not fear,</q> the priest
said, taking the packet and looking
it over. He thought a moment. <q>I
will write also on this that, in the
event of my death, it is to be
opened by F. O'Donovan or by the
bishop of the diocese.</q>
</p>

<p>
He went to a table, wrote the
directions, and then gave them to
Annette to read.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is a private paper of mine,</q>
she said, after reading and giving
it back; <q>and I have the right to
say when it shall be read. I give
it into your hands only on the condition
that my directions shall be
complied with.</q>
</p>

<p>
He bowed, understanding perfectly
that the words were intended
as a future shield for him.
</p>

<p>
<q>At the same time, you will open
this also, which is yours,</q> she added,
and gave him a paper roll sealed
and tied, but without any direction.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse shrank a little,
took the roll, then let it drop from
his trembling hand. The cold and
business-like manner of his visitor
and his sympathy for her had kept
his thoughts fixed on her; but
here was something which brought
his mother's image up before him
with a terrible distinctness. It was
impossible for him not to know
that this little package was what
she had died in trying to save.
Tears blinded his eyes. The last
evening he had spent with her
came back like a vision; he saw
her face, heard her voice, saw her
kneeling before him for his blessing.
</p>

<p>
Making an effort to control and
hide his emotion, he stooped to
take up the package he had dropped;
and when he looked up again,
his visitor had left the room, and
was walking quickly to the street
door. For one moment he stood
irresolute; then he hurried after
her. But she had already gone
out, and either did not or would
not hear him call her back.
</p>

<p>
The sight of her going away
so, wrung all thought of selfish grief
out of his mind. He went back
into the room, and watched her as
she walked swiftly up the street.
So innocent, so generous, so brave
as she was, yet of all the sufferers
by this miserable tragedy, with one
exception, the most unhappy! The
grief that must fall upon the mother
of the guilty one no one could
<pb n='253'/><anchor id='Pg253'/>
fathom; but the mother of a criminal
can never hold herself surely
innocent of his crimes, since a
greater holiness in her own life, a
wiser care in his training, and a
more constant prayerfulness in his
behalf might have saved him; but
the young wife was, of all people
in the world, the most innocent and
the most wronged.
</p>

<p>
How light and graceful her step
was. Who would not think that
it betokened a light heart? She
met an acquaintance, and stopped
for a word of greeting, and the
friend came along afterward smiling,
as though at some merry jest. Passing
the house of another friend,
she nodded and kissed her hand to
a child in the window, with how
bright a face the priest, who had
seen her self-control, could well
guess.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is there nothing I can do,
nothing I can say, to help her?</q>
he asked himself, turning away
from the window. <q>It is cruel
that one so young should bear
alone such a burden! What can
I do? What can I do?</q>
</p>

<p>
He searched in vain for some
means of help. There was none.
For what she should do her own
wit or the advice of others must
suffice; and for words of comfort,
they were not for him to speak to
her. Her manner had shown clearly
the distance which she felt must
lie between them, and there was no
way but for him to accept that
position. He could pray, and that
was all.
</p>

<p>
By the time he had come to this
conclusion, Annette Gerald had
reached the convent, and was
greeting Sister Cecilia.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have only two words to say
to you, dear Sister,</q> she said, <q>and
those may seem very childish, but
are not so in reality. Lawrence
and I are going to make a little
journey, which may last about four
weeks, and poor mamma will be
lonely. Besides that, she will
worry. She hates to have me go
away from her. Will not you be
very kind to her, if she should come
to you? Oh! I know you always
are that; but recollect, when you
see her, that I am really all she has.
A son does not count for much,
you know, especially when he is a
young man. Very few young men
are much comfort to their mothers,
I think. Tell F. Chevreuse the
very first time you see him that I
said this to you, but don't tell any
one else. And now, dear Sister, I
have but a little time, for we start
this evening. If there is no one
in the chapel, I would like to go in
a while. People have got so in
the habit of wandering into the
Immaculate, and looking about
carelessly, that it is no longer
pleasant to go there.</q>
</p>

<p>
The same air, as of a person
gentle, indeed, but not to be detained
nor trifled with, which had
impressed F. Chevreuse in his visitor,
was felt by the Sister also.
She rose at once, saying that there
was no one in the chapel, and
would not be for some time, all the
Sisters being engaged, unless Anita
should go in.
</p>

<p>
<q>Anita has not been well?</q> Mrs.
Gerald remarked with absent courtesy.
</p>

<p>
<q>No; she has not been the same
since that terrible trial,</q> the nun
sighed.
</p>

<p>
Annette Gerald's face lost its
absent expression, and took a somewhat
haughty and unsympathizing
look. <q>Is that all?</q> she inquired
in a tone of surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>But, you know,</q> expostulated
the Sister, <q>Anita's testimony was
of the greatest importance. Besides,
<pb n='254'/><anchor id='Pg254'/>
the scene was a most painful
one for her to be dragged into.
She is such a tender, sensitive creature.</q>
</p>

<p>
Annette had paused just inside
the parlor-door, and she had evidently
no mind to let the subject
drop indifferently.
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear Sister,</q> she said with
decision, <q>I am truly sorry for your
sweet little Anita; but I think it
wrong to foster the idea that there
are certain sensitive souls in the
world who must be pitied if a
breath blows on them, while others
are supposed to be able to bear the
hurricane without being hurt. A
great deal of this shrinking delicacy
comes from a selfish watching
of one's own sensations, and forgetting
those of others, and a
great deal from being pampered by
others. You remember, perhaps,
an old myth, which I have half forgotten,
of a Camilla who was fastened
to a lance and shot across a
stream. She was a woman soft and
weak, perhaps, but she had to go.
Now, in this world there is many
a woman who has all the miserable
sensitiveness and delicacy of her
kind, but with that there is also a
will, or an unselfishness, or a necessity
which transfixes her like a
spear, and carries her through all
sorts of difficulties.</q> For one instant
a flash of some passion, either
of anger, impatience, or pain, or of
all mingled, shot into the speaker's
face, and seemed to thrill through
all her nerves. <q>Oh! it is true in
this world also,</q> she exclaimed,
<q>that unto him that hath shall be
given. The happy must be shielded
from pain, and those who cry
out at the prick of a pin must be
tenderly handled; but the miserable
may have yet more misery
heaped on them, and the patient
find no mercy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear lady!</q> expostulated
Sister Cecilia, when the other
paused, quivering with excitement.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! I do not mean to speak
harshly of your sweet little Anita,</q>
interrupted Mrs. Gerald, recovering
herself; <q>I was only reminded
of others, that is all. But even to
her I would recommend thinking
more of the sufferings of others
and less of her own.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is precisely that which hurts
her,</q> replied the Sister, a little displeased.
<q>She thinks of the sufferings
of others, and, fancying
that she has caused them, breaks
her heart about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Annette made a motion to go,
and had an air of thinking very
slightingly of the young novice's
troubles. <q>She merely did her
duty, and has no responsibility
whatever,</q> she said. <q>The child
needs to be scolded, and set about
some hard, wholesome work. It
would do her good to work in the
garden, and spend a good deal of
time in the open air. A person
who has been taken possession of
by some morbid idea should never
be shut up in a house.</q>
</p>

<p>
Sister Cecilia suffered her visitor
to pass on without saying another
word. She was surprised and
deeply hurt at the little sympathy
shown their household flower and
pet, yet she could not but perceive
that, in a general way, much that
had been said was quite true.
</p>

<p>
Passing by the chapel-door shortly
after, she saw Annette Gerald
on her knees before the altar,
with her head bowed forward and
hidden in her hands. Half an
hour afterwards, when Mrs. Ferrier's
carriage came, she was still
in the same position, and had to
be spoken to twice before she
was roused. Then she started and
looked up in alarm.
</p>

<pb n='255'/><anchor id='Pg255'/>

<p>
<q>Your carriage has come,</q> whispered
the Sister, and looked quickly
away from the face turned toward
her, it was so white and worn.
In that half-hour she seemed to
have grown ten years older.
</p>

<p>
<q>Must I go now?</q> she exclaimed,
with an air of terror, and for a
moment seemed not to know where
she was. Then murmuring an excuse,
she recalled herself, and, by
some magic, threw off again the
look of age and pain. <q>You need
not call Sister Cecilia, only say
good-by to her for me,</q> she said.
<q>I have really not a moment to
spare.</q>
</p>

<p>
This Sister was almost a stranger
to Mrs. Annette Gerald, and was
quite taken by surprise when the
lady turned at the door, and, without
a word of farewell, kissed her,
and then hurried away.
</p>

<p>
<q>Drive to the office, John, for
Mr. Gerald,</q> she said; and no one
would have suspected from her
manner that she trembled before
the man to whom she gave that
careless order.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence came running lightly
down the stairs, having been on
the watch for his wife, and John,
holding the carriage-door open,
winked with astonishment at sight
of the bright greeting exchanged
between the two. He could maintain
a cold and stolid reserve, if he
had anything to conceal; but this
airy gayety on the brink of ruin
was not only beyond his power,
but beyond his comprehension.
</p>

<p>
Stealing a glance of scrutiny into
the young man's face, he met a
glance of defiant <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>hauteur</foreign>. <q>You
need not go any further with us,
John,</q> Lawrence said. <q>We shall
not need you. Jack, drive round
to Mrs. Gerald's.</q>
</p>

<p>
And John, with his coat down to
his heels&mdash;a costume in which nothing
would have induced him voluntarily
to take a promenade&mdash;was
forced to walk home, comforting
himself with the assurance that it
was the last order he should have
to obey from that source. Perhaps,
indeed, he would not have
obeyed it now, had they not driven
away and left him no choice.
</p>

<p>
The sun was declining toward
the west, and touching everything
with the tender glory of early
spring, when they drew up at the
cottage gate, the sound of their
wheels bringing Mrs. Gerald and
Honora to the window, and then
to the door.
</p>

<p>
<q>We can't stop to come in, Mamma
Gerald,</q> Annette called out.
<q>We are going off on a little visit,
and only come to say good-by.
Isn't it beautiful this afternoon?
The trees will soon begin to bud, if
this weather continues.</q>
</p>

<p>
The two ladies came out to the
carriage, and Mrs. Gerald caught
sight of her son's face, which had
been turned away. It had grown
suddenly white. She exclaimed:
<q>Why, Lawrence! what is the matter?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! another of those faint
turns,</q> interposed his wife quickly,
laying her hand on his arm. <q>He
has no appetite, and is really fainting
from lack of nourishment. The
journey will do him good, mamma.
We are going entirely on his account.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! yes, it's nothing but a turn
that will soon pass away,</q> he added,
and seemed, indeed, already better.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do come in and take something
warm,</q> his mother said anxiously,
her beautiful blue eyes fixed on his
face. <q>There is some chocolate
just made.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We have no time,</q> Annette began;
but her husband immediately
opened the carriage-door.
</p>

<pb n='256'/><anchor id='Pg256'/>

<p>
<q>Yes, mother,</q> he said. <q>I won't
keep you waiting but a minute, Ninon.</q>
</p>

<p>
The mother put her hand in his
arm, and still turned her anxious
face toward him. <q>You mustn't
go to-night, if you feel sick, my
son,</q> she said. <q>You know what
happened to you before.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But the journey is just what I
need, mother,</q> he answered, trying
to speak cheerfully. <q>Of course I
won't go if I feel unwell; but this
is really nothing. I have not quite
got my strength up, and, as Annette
says, I have eaten nothing to-day.</q>
</p>

<p>
Those little services of a mother,
how tender and touching they are
at any time! how terrible in their
pathos when we know that they
will soon be at an end for us for
ever! How the hand trembles to
take the cup, and the lip trembles
to touch its brim, when we know
that she would have filled it with
her life-blood, if that could have
been saving to us!
</p>

<p>
<q>Sit here by the fire, dear, while
I get your chocolate,</q> Mrs. Gerald
said, and pushed the chair close to
the hearth. <q>There is really quite
a chill in the air.</q>
</p>

<p>
She stirred the fire, and made the
red coals glow warmly, then went
out of the room.
</p>

<p>
He looked round after her the
moment her back was turned, and
watched her hastening through the
entry. The temptation was strong
to follow her, throw himself at her
feet, and tell her all. He started
up from the chair, and took a step,
but came back again. It would
kill her, and he could not see her
die. He would let her live yet the
four weeks left her. Perhaps she
might die a natural death before
that. He hoped she would. At
that thought, a sudden flame of
hope and of trust in God rose in
his heart. He dropped on his
knees. <q>O my God! take my mother
home before she hears of this,
and I will do any penance, bear
anything!</q> he prayed, with vehement
rapidity. <q>Be merciful to
her, and take her!</q>
</p>

<p>
He heard her step returning, and
hastily resumed his seat, and bent
forward to the fire.
</p>

<p>
<q>You look better already,</q> she
said, smiling. <q>You have a little
color now. Here is your chocolate,
and Annette is calling to you to
make haste.</q>
</p>

<p>
She held the little tray for him, and
he managed, strengthened by that
desperate hope of his, to empty the
cup, and even smile faintly in giving
it back. And then he got up,
put his arm around his mother's
waist, in a boyish fashion he had
sometimes with her, and went out
to the door with her so. And there
he kissed her, and jumped into the
carriage, and was driven away. It
never occurred to her, so sweetly
obedient had he been to her requests,
and so expressive had his
looks and actions been, that he had
not uttered a word while he was in
the house nor when he drove away.
He had accepted her little services
with affection and gratitude, and he
had been tender and caressing, and
that was enough. Moreover, he had
really looked better on leaving,
which proved that her prescription
had done him good.
</p>

<p>
How Annette Gerald got away
from home she could not have told
afterward. Her trunks were sent
in advance, and she and her husband
chose to walk to the station
in the evening. Some way she succeeded
in answering all her mother's
charges and anxious forebodings.
She promised to sit in a middle car,
so as to be at the furthest point
from a collision in front or rear,
<pb n='257'/><anchor id='Pg257'/>
and to have the life-preservers all
ready at hand in the steamer. She
took the basket of luncheon her
mother put up, and allowed her
bonnet to be tied for her and her
shawl pinned. And at last they
were in the portico, and it was
necessary to say good-by.
</p>

<p>
<q>My poor mamma! don't be too
anxious about me, whatever happens,</q>
Annette said. <q>Remember
God takes care of us all. I hope
he will take care of you. Whenever
you feel disposed to worry about
us, say a little prayer, and all will
come right again.</q>
</p>

<p>
The darkness hid the tears that
rolled down her cheeks as she ended,
and in a few minutes all was
over, and the two were walking arm-in-arm
down the quiet street.
</p>

<p>
<q>This way!</q> Lawrence said when
they came to the street where his
mother lived.
</p>

<p>
It was out of their way, but they
went down by the house, and paused
in front of it. The windows of the
sitting-room were brightly lighted,
and they could see by the glow of
the lamp that it stood on a table
drawn before the fire. As they
looked, a shadow leaned forward
on the white curtain. Mrs. Gerald
was leaning with her elbow on the
table, and talking to some one.
They saw the slender hand that
supported her chin, and the coil
of her heavy hair. They saw the
slight movement with which she
pushed back a lock of hair that had
a way of falling on to her forehead.
</p>

<p>
Annette felt the arm she held
tremble. She only pressed it the
closer, that he might not forget that
love still was near him, but did not
speak. There was nothing for her
to say.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let's go inside the gate to the
window,</q> he whispered. <q>Perhaps
I can hear her speak.</q>
</p>

<p>
She softly opened the gate, and
entered with him. The moonless
night was slightly overclouded, and
the shadows of the trees hid them
perfectly, as they stole close to the
window like two thieves. Lawrence
pressed his face to the sash, and
listened breathlessly. There was a
low murmur of voices inside, then
a few words distinctly spoken.
<q>And by the way, dear, I forgot to
close the blinds. Oh! no, I will
close them. Don't rise!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald came to the window,
opened it, and leaned out so close
to her son that he heard the rustle
of her dress and fancied that he
felt her breath on his cheek. She
was silent a moment, looking up at
the sky. <q>The night is very soft
and mild,</q> she said. <q>Those children
will have a pleasant journey.</q>
One instant longer she rested there,
her hand half extended to the blind,
then she sent upward a word of
prayer, which brushed her son's
cheek in passing. <q>O God! protect
my son!</q> she said.
</p>

<p>
Then the blinds were drawn together,
and the son was shut out
from her sight and sound for ever.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is our signal to go,</q> Annette
whispered to her husband. <q>Come!
We have no time to lose.</q>
</p>

<p>
He held her by the arm a moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Isn't it better, after all, to stay
and have it out here?</q> he asked
desperately. <q>I'd rather face
danger than fly from it. Running
away makes me seem worse than I
am.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You have no longer the right
to consider yourself,</q> she answered,
with a certain sternness. <q>I will
not submit to have a convict for a
husband. I would rather see you
dead. And your mother shall not
visit you in a felon's cell. Besides,
no one is to be profited by such a
<pb n='258'/><anchor id='Pg258'/>
piece of folly, and you would yourself
repent it when too late. Come!</q>
</p>

<p>
He said no more, but suffered
himself to be drawn away. He
could not complain that his wife
treated his heroic impulses with a
disrespect amounting almost to
contempt, for he could not himself
trust them.
</p>

<p>
After having closed the window,
Mrs. Gerald returned to her place
by the fire. A round table was
drawn up there between two armchairs,
in one of which Miss Pembroke
sat, knitting a scarf of crimson
wool. The shade over the lamp
kept its strong light from her eyes,
and threw a faint shadow on the
upper part of her face; but her
sweet and serious mouth, and the
round chin, with its faint dent of a
dimple, were illuminated, her brown
dress had rich yellow lights on the
folds, and the end of a straying curl
on her shoulder almost sparkled
with gold. Her eyes were downcast
and fixed on her work, and
crimson loop after loop dropped
swiftly from the ivory needles
scarcely whiter than her hands.
</p>

<p>
<q>As I was saying,</q> Mrs. Gerald
resumed, <q>six months of the year
they were to pass with Mrs. Ferrier
have gone, and next fall they will
have an establishment of their own.
It will be better for both of them.
I am sure Annette will make a
good housekeeper. Besides, every
married man should be the master
of a house. It gives him a place
in the world, and makes him feel
his responsibilities and dignities
more.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, every one should have a
home,</q> answered the young woman
gravely. <q>It is a great safeguard.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald leaned back in her
chair, and gazed into the fire. There
was a smile of contentment on her
lips and an air of gentle pride in
the carriage of her head. As she
thought, or dreamed, she turned
about the birth-day ring her son
had given her, and, presently becoming
aware of what she was doing,
looked at it and smiled as if
she were smiling in his face.
</p>

<p>
<q>I never before felt so well contented
and satisfied with his situation,</q>
she said, her happiness
breaking into words. <q>His marriage
has turned out well. They
seem to be perfectly united, and
Lawrence is really proud of his
wife; and with reason. She is no
more like what she was when I first
knew her than a butterfly is like a
grub. She has developed wonderfully.</q>
She was silent a moment,
then added: <q>I am very thankful.</q>
</p>

<p>
She drew a rosary from her
pocket, and, leaning back in her
chair with her eyes closed, began
to whisper the prayers as the beads
slipped through her fingers.
</p>

<p>
Miss Pembroke glanced at her,
and smiled faintly. It was very
pleasant to see this mother happy
in her son, yet how trembling and
precarious was her happiness!
This woman's heart, which bruised
itself in beating, was always ready
to catch some fleeting glory on its
springing tide; like the fountain,
which holds the rainbow a moment
among its chilly drops.
</p>

<p>
While one woman prayed, the
other thought. She had often
dwelt upon this subject of women's
lives being wrecked from love of
friend, husband, or child, and the
sight of Mrs. Gerald had been to
her a constant illustration of such
a wreck. These thoughts had
troubled her, for she was not one
to judge hastily, and she did not
know whether to pity or to blame
so ruinous a devotion. Now again
the question floated up, and with it
the wish to decide once for all before
<pb n='259'/><anchor id='Pg259'/>
life should thrust the problem
on her, when she would be too
confused to think rightly. She was
like one who stands safe yet wistful
on shore, looking off over troubled
waters, and Mrs. Gerald and
Annette seemed to her tossing far
out on the waves. She even seemed
to herself to have approached
the brink so near that the salt tide
had touched her feet, and to have
drawn back only just in time.
</p>

<p>
Gradually, as her fair fingers
wove the glowing web, a faint cloud
came over her face, and, if it had
been possible for her to frown, that
deeper shadow between the brows
might have been called a frown.
Her thoughts were growing stern.
</p>

<p>
<q>Were we made upright, we women,
only to bend like reeds to
every wind?</q> she asked herself.
<q>Can we not be gentle without
being slavish, and kind and tender
without pouring our hearts out like
water? Cannot we reserve something
to ourselves, even while giving
all and even more than our
friends deserve? Cannot we hold
our peace and happiness so firmly
in our own hands that no one shall
have the power to destroy them?</q>
</p>

<p>
Each question as it came met
with a prompt answer, and resolution
followed swiftly: <q>Never will
I suffer myself to be so enslaved
by any affection as to lose my individuality
and be merged and lost
in another, or be made wretched by
another, or to have my sense of
justice and right confused by the
desire to make excuses for one I
love. Never will I suffer the name
which I have kept stainless to be
associated with the disgrace of another,
and never will I leave the
orderly and honorable ways of life,
where I have walked so far, to follow
any one into the by-ways, for
any pretext. Each one is to save
his own soul, and to help others
only to a certain extent. I will
keep my place!</q>
</p>

<p>
That resolute and almost haughty
face seemed scarcely to be Honora
Pembroke's; and she felt so
surely that her expression would
check and startle her companion
that when she saw Mrs. Gerald
drop the rosary from her fingers,
and turn to speak to her, she quickly
changed her position so as to
hide her face a moment.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald's voice had changed
while she prayed, and seemed
weighted with a calm seriousness
from her heavenly communion;
and her first words jarred strangely
with her young friend's thought.
</p>

<p>
<q>How uncalculating the saints
were!</q> she said. <q>Our Lady was
the only one, I think, who escaped
personal contumely, and that was
not because she risked nothing, but
because God would not suffer contempt
nor slander to touch her.
He spared her no pang, save that
of disgrace; yet she would have accepted
that without a complaint.
How tender he was of her! He
gave her a nominal spouse to shield
her motherhood; it was through
her Son that her heart was pierced,
and the grief of a mother is always
sacred; and he gave her always
loving and devoted women, who
clustered about and made her little
court. She was never alone.
But she is an exception. The
others were despised and maltreated,
and they seemed to be perpetually
throwing themselves away. I
do not doubt that those saints who
never suffered martyrdom nor persecution
were still, in their day,
laughed and mocked at by some
more than they were honored by
others. They never stopped to
count the cost.</q>
</p>

<p>
Miss Pembroke felt at the first
<pb n='260'/><anchor id='Pg260'/>
instant as though Mrs. Gerald
must have read her thoughts, and
her reply came like a retort. <q>It
is true they did not count the
costs,</q> she said; <q>but it was God
whom they loved.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> Mrs. Gerald replied gently,
<q>that was what I meant.</q>
</p>

<p>
She was too closely wrapped
in contentment to perceive the
coldness with which her companion
spoke. It seemed to her that
all her cares had floated away, and
left only rest and sweetness behind.
She no longer feared anything.
There comes to every one
some happy season in life, she
thought; and hers had come.
</p>

<p>
When, the next day, she received
a note from her son, which he had
written from their first stopping-place,
she was scarcely surprised,
though it was an unusual attention.
</p>

<p>
It was but a hurried line, written
with a pencil and posted in the
station-house.
</p>

<p>
<q>My darling mother,</q> he wrote,
<q>if you should find your violet-bed
under the parlor window trampled,
blame Larry for it. He saw his
mother's shadow on the curtain
when he was on his way to the station
last night, and took a fancy to
go nearer and peep through the
window. But he didn't mean to
do any harm then, nor at some
other times, when he did enough
indeed. Forgive him for everything.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald immediately went
out, letter in hand, to see what
marks had been left of this nocturnal
visit; and, sure enough,
there, on the newly-turned mould,
was the print of a boot&mdash;well she
knew her son's neat foot&mdash;and, on
the other side, a tiny and delicate
track where Annette had stood!
But not a leaf of the sprouting violets
was crushed.
</p>

<p>
Miss Pembroke smiled to see the
mother touch these tracks softly
with her finger-tips, and glance
about as if to assure herself that
there was no danger of their being
effaced.
</p>

<p>
<q>Such a freak of those children!</q>
she said gaily. <q>Do you know
what I am going to do, Honora? I
mean to sow little pink quill daisies
in those two foot-prints, and show
them to Lawrence and Annette
when they come back. It was a
beautiful thought of them to come
to the window, and it shall be commemorated
in beauty. The ground
is nearly warm enough here now
for seeds. When they come back,
the tracks will be green. I wish
flowers would blossom in three
weeks.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ferrier also heard that day
from the travellers.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have a particular reason for
asking you to be very careful
about my letters,</q> Annette wrote.
<q>Don't let any one see or know of
them. I will tell you why presently.
We are very well. Write
me a line as soon as you receive
this, and direct to New York. We
shall not stop there, but go right
on out West, probably. And, by
the way, if you should wish ever to
hear from Mrs. Gerald's relations,
seek in New York for a letter directed
to Mrs. Julia Ward. Say
nothing of this now. I will explain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And why should I wish to hear
from Mrs. Gerald's relations?</q>
wondered Mrs. Ferrier. But she
said nothing. The secret was safe
with her.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the travellers had lost
no time on their way; and three
days from their leaving Crichton,
they were on the ocean. Every
stateroom and cabin had been taken
when <q>Mr. and Mrs. Ward</q>
<pb n='261'/><anchor id='Pg261'/>
went to the office of the steamer;
but the captain, seeing the lady in
great distress on account of the sick
friend she was crossing the ocean
to see, kindly gave up his own stateroom
to the travellers.
</p>

<p>
It was quite as well for him to do
so, indeed; for the very day they
started a storm started with them,
and he was too faithful an officer
to desert his post on deck. So all
night long he watched, courageous
and faithful, over the lives committed
to his care, while underneath
his two special guests lay helpless
and miserable, counting his footsteps,
as sleepless as he. The
engine throbbed beside them, like
a heavily-beating heart, the long
waves lashed the deck, the wind
sang and whistled through the
ropes, the steamer creaked and
groaned.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have brought bad luck to the
ship, Annette,</q> said her husband.
<q>If I were overboard, the storm
would cease.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the first place, my name is
Julia,</q> was the answer from the
lower berth. <q>In the next place,
there is nothing mysterious in this
storm; it is simply the equinoctial
gale, which has been threatening
for days. I knew we should have
it. In the third place, your being
overboard would make no difference
whatever in the weather. Are
you sick?</q>
</p>

<p>
Annette knew well that a little
chilly breeze would best blow away
her husband's vapors.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am sick of lying here,</q> he
said impatiently. <q>The rain must
be over, unless it is another flood.
I wonder how it looks out?</q>
</p>

<p>
He drew aside the curtain, and
opened the window. The rain had
ceased, but the wind still blew, and
a pale light was everywhere, shining
up through the waves and down
through the clouds. As the steamer
rolled, Annette, lying in her lower
berth, could see alternately the gray
and tumbled clouds of air, and the
gray and heaving sea, which was
less like moving water than a ruined,
quaking earth, so heavily it rose
and fell.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence Gerald, closely wrapped
in furs, knelt on the sofa, and
looked out, humming a tune that
seemed to be for ever on his lips
since his wife had first sung it to
him, so that she was sometimes half
sorry for having suggested it to him.
A few words broke out while she
listened:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>For man never slept</q></l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>In a different bed,</l>
<l>And to sleep, you must slumber</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'><q rend='post'>In just such a bed.</q></l>
</lg>

</quote>

<p>
His thoughts seemed to be so
haunted by the image of that cold
and peaceful slumber that his wife
trembled for him. He had not the
enduring strength to bear a long
trial, but he had that fitful strength
which prompts to desperate deeds.
</p>

<p>
<q>I can see cities built and destroyed
yonder,</q> he said. <q>There
are white towns between dark
mountains, and little hamlets up in
the crevices; they grow, and then
they are swallowed up. It is like
a great earthquake. When the
world is destroyed, it will perhaps
look like that, pale and ashy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Suppose we should go up on
deck, and see what it looks like,</q>
said Annette suddenly, anticipating
the wish she knew he would have
expressed. <q>It will be a change
after our three days' imprisonment,
and we may think the stateroom
a pleasant refuge when we come
back.</q>
</p>

<p>
They escaped the crest of a wave
that leaped over the rail after them,
and reached the wet and slippery
deck.
</p>

<p>
<q>We mustn't speak to the officers,</q>
<pb n='262'/><anchor id='Pg262'/>
Annette whispered, seeing
the captain near them.
</p>

<p>
He passed them by without notice,
and they hurried on to the
shelter of the smoke-pipe, where
the heat had dried the planks; and
here, holding by ropes, they could
look over the rail and see the long
streaks of pale blue, where the foam
slid under the surface of the water;
see the gigantic struggle of the sea,
and how the brave ship pushed
through it all straight toward her
unseen port.
</p>

<p>
Nothing is so perfect a figure of
life as a ship on the sea, and one
can hardly behold it without moralizing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Suppose that this ship had a
soul of its own, instead of being
guided by the will of other beings,</q>
said Annette; <q>and suppose that,
finding itself in such a woful case,
it should say, <q>I see no port, no
pole-star, no sun, nor moon, and I
doubt if I shall ever see them
again. I may as well stop trying,
and go down here.</q> Wouldn't that
be a pity for itself and for others?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But suppose, on the other
hand,</q> returned her husband, <q>that
the ship had got a deadly thrust
from some unseen rock, and the
water was running in, and it could
never gain the port. What would
be the use of its striving and straining
for a few leagues further?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We know not where the haven
of a soul is set,</q> said Annette,
dropping the figure. <q>God knows,
for he has set it, near or far; and
it may be nearer than we think. It
is scarcely worth while for a man
to lose his soul by jumping overboard
at ten o'clock, when he may
save it, and be drowned too, at
eleven.</q>
</p>

<p>
Lawrence drew back as a great
wave rose before them. He had
only been playing at death; the
reality was quite another thing.
Chilled and drenched with spray,
they hurried down to their stateroom.
</p>

<p>
It was a weary journey. After
the storm came head-winds, and
after the head-winds a fog, through
which they crept, ringing the fog-bell,
and stopping now and then.
</p>

<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Ward did not appear
once among the passengers,
even when everybody crowded up
to catch the first glimpse of Ireland,
and they were the last to appear
when the passengers prepared to
land at Liverpool. They had been
a fortnight from home, the storm
having delayed them two days, and
they knew not what might have
happened in that time. A telegram
might have sped under the waves in
an hour while they toiled over them,
and just at the moment of escape
their flight might be intercepted.

<head>Dante Gabriel Rosetti.<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Poems.</hi> By Dante Gabriel Rosetti. London.
1871.</note></head>

<p>
It is not difficult to understand the
title which has been bestowed upon
Mr. Rosetti of the <q>Poets' Poet.</q>
His volume is full of delicate rhythmical
experiments&mdash;winding bouts of
melody with subtle catches of silence
interspersed&mdash;which alternately pique
and satisfy. No brother of the craft
could fail to obtain valuable hints
from these studies. But Mr. Rosetti
is no mere word-poiser; he is an artist
in the highest sense of the word,
whose canvas teems with a thousand
nameless lights, which as they
cross and disappear make all the difference
between the real and the unreal.
</p>

<p>
During the two years or more that
Mr. Rosetti's volume has been before
the English-reading public on
both sides of the Atlantic, it has been
frequently reviewed. Perhaps the
best justification of the present review
is that, over and above purely literary
merits, Mr. Rosetti has peculiar
claims upon the interest of Catholic
readers, to which we would draw attention.
</p>

<p>
We gather from the brief notice at
the beginning of the volume that
many of these poems were composed
twenty years ago, yet, if we except
the occasional appearance of a
single poem in the pages of a magazine,
Mr. Rosetti has published nothing
before. We can hardly believe
that even the barbarians of twenty
years ago can have combined against
his publishing, like Mr. Bazzard's
friends in <hi rend='italic'>Edwin Drood</hi>, and so we
must suppose that he was fain to
wait for the severest of all criticisms&mdash;that
passed by a middle-aged man
upon the productions of his youth.
And now, having altered something
and burnt more&mdash;had he waited, he
would have found old age more indulgent&mdash;he
publishes the remnant,
all of which, he tells us justly enough,
is mature, for which his mature age
is sponsor.
</p>

<p>
It would be far easier to estimate
Mr. Rosetti's position as a poet had
he written more. Nor is this precisely
a truism; for one feels at once
that what he has given us is most precisely
and emphatically a selection.
Every one of his poems, whatever
else it may be, is at least a cunning
piece of artist's work in this or that
particular style, with a distinct flavor
of its own and true to itself
throughout. If you know, and care
for, the old Scots ballad, you will at
once appreciate the specimen he gives
you. If you object to the coarseness
which shades the tenderness of
<q>Stratton Water,</q> your criticism is unlearned.
As well complain of the
peat flavor of a <q>Finnan haddie.</q>
</p>

<p>
Poets who sing because they must
sing, who pour into trembling ears
great heterogeneous floods of song,
the reflection of their many moods,
things beautiful and rather beautiful,
and plain and very plain; all the thousand-and-one
scraps which have something
clever in them, or illustrate
something, or with the composition
of which something interesting, whether
pleasant or painful, is associated&mdash;take,
for instance, any chance volume
of Wordsworth or Browning&mdash;may be
in the long run our benefactors, but
they have no claim upon the ready-money
of thanks; they charm, perhaps,
<pb n='264'/><anchor id='Pg264'/>
but they often also bore. If
a man whose imagination has not
been left out is bored by Mr. Rosetti's
volume, it is time for him, according
to the Turkish proverb, to put
his trust in God&mdash;his wine is running
to the lees, his roses wither. And this
is true although the generations of
poetic taste are so short-lived that almost
before a man has reached the
<hi rend='italic'>mezzo camino</hi>, and certainly before
he has lost his sense of life's enjoyments,
he is apt to find himself somewhat
out of harmony with the poetry
of the day. Mr. Rosetti is no prophet
of a new theory of art or master
of a new phrase-mint, but rather a
merchant whose cargo tells a tale of
every port at which he has touched.
</p>

<p>
It is natural to compare, even if
only to contrast, any new poet with
Mr. Tennyson, as the poet who has
had more immediate, sensible influence
than any other upon the
taste of his day; and although there
is a prejudice against comparisons,
it is difficult to see how they can be
avoided if one is to do something
more than point and ejaculate. In
the present case, there is at least sufficient
resemblance to suggest comparison.
Amongst living poets these
two are pre-eminently artist-poets,
who finish their work and hide well
away all their literary shavings.
They are almost the only living
poets who never go on talking till
they can find the right word, and
who never stammer.
</p>

<p>
There is not a scrap of either of
these poets that, for the refined work
there is in it, it would not be a shame
to burn. Again, they are like in this,
that they have an intense sensuous appreciation
of the medium which they
use, which seems to belong rather to
the art of the painter or the musician
than to that of the poet. It would
not be difficult to make a color-box
of Mr. Tennyson's favorite words,
literary formulas for cool grays and
bits of scarlet. On the other hand,
Mr. Rosetti's art is rather that of the
musician than the painter; he produces
his effects rather by subtle
changes of manner than by the color
of single words, although his choice
in these too is exquisite. His modulations
remind one of Crashaw's
lines in <q>Music's Duel</q>:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>The lute's light genius now doth proudly rise,</q></l>
<l>Heaved on the surges of swoll'n rhapsodies.</l>
<l>Whose flourish, meteor-like, doth curl the air</l>
<l>With flash of high-born fancies; here and there</l>
<l>Dancing in lofty measures, and anon</l>
<l>Creeps on the soft touch of a tender tone,</l>
<l>Whose trembling murmurs, melting in wild airs,</l>
<l><q rend='post'>Run to and fro, complaining his sweet cares.</q></l>
</lg>

</quote>

<p>
And so, having drifted into points
of difference, we will continue. They
are unlike because, although both
affect the quaintnesses of mediæval
art, the laureate has done little more
than utilize, for poetic purposes, the
antiquarian and art knowledge of a
gentleman of the period with a turn
that way. But Mr. Rosetti is a mediæval
artist heart and soul; and,
though it may not be literally true
that he has no end beyond his art, he
would certainly feel that he was doing
evil that good might come of it if he
sacrificed a point of art to any object
whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tennyson's pictures of the
middle-age, beautiful and lifelike as
they are, are the less true for their
somewhat formal flourish of antiquity,
whereby they give themselves, as it
were, a modern frame. Of course,
Tennyson's knights are not modern
gentlemen in the sense that Racine's
Greeks are French courtiers, but anyhow
they are the realized aspirations
of modern gentlemen of culture and
refinement, and measures of fashionable
reaction against the spirit of the
day.
</p>

<p>
I think the consciousness that he
wants a loosely-fitting mediævalism,
or, so to speak, the armor without
<pb n='265'/><anchor id='Pg265'/>
any particular quality of man inside,
makes Mr. Tennyson affect the hybrid
mediævalism of the Round Table
in preference to the genuine strain of
the old chroniclers. His mail-clad
knights always remind us somewhat
of a common scene in a marine
aquarium&mdash;a whelk-shell inspired
with an energy not its own by the
intrusion of a hermit-crab, who, having
disposed of the original occupant,
manipulates the shell at his pleasure.
</p>

<p>
It may be urged, with some justice,
that a poet is no mere collector of
old china and old lace. He gathers
to himself of all precious things, to
frame for his thought such vehicle as
he wants; but he has no duties to his
materials that they should be in keeping
with one another or with themselves,
provided they minister to his
design. Yes, but it must be remembered
that both these poets belong to
a school which owes its success to the
religious observance of such duties,
even though self-imposed; and it
must always remain true that the
more a poet can afford to borrow
wholes instead of parts or aspects,
and these plead the poet's cause each
in its own tongue, not his, the greater
is his triumph. I am not indicating
any failure on the part of Mr.
Tennyson when I speak of his Arthurian
poems as a splendid masque.
He knows where his strength lies.
He has chosen his legend as a man
might choose an antique wine-cooler
for his wine; but the liquor inside,
though superlatively good, is not
hippocras or metheglin, but port and
sherry. On the other hand, if we
turn to Mr. Rosetti's treatment of
mediæval subjects, <q>Dante at Verona,</q>
<q>Sister Helen,</q> <q>The Staff
and Scrip,</q> we find that his mediæval
figures live, indeed, with the intensest
kind of life, but that that life, from its
woof to its outermost fringe, is stained
with the color of its own day and
country. It is this union of purism
and vitality which is Mr. Rosetti's
distinguishing characteristic.
</p>

<p>
It is now time for us to examine
some of Mr. Rosetti's poems in detail.
<q>The Blessed Damozel,</q> the
first poem in the volume, were it not
for its title, would be perfect; but we
confess that the ultra quaintness of
the title is the one point in the
mediæval dress which does not, to
our mind, harmonize with the Catholicity
of the subject.
</p>

<p>
The subject would be trite enough
in many hands. A young man has
lost his love, and dreams of her night
and day, until at length the soul of his
imagination pierces that heaven into
which she has been received ten years
ago:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<l><q rend='pre'>Her seemed she scarce had been a day</q></l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>One of God's choristers;</l>

<p>
With the calm, unhesitating realism
of Fra Angelico, he paints his lady
leaning out towards him <q>from the
gold bar of heaven,</q> with stars in her
hair and lilies in her hand; and the
outline is so clear and firm, so free
from the mist of modern sentimentalism,
that the paroxysm of doubt
which breaks in at the end of the
fourth stanza, and which for a moment
makes the radiant vision tremulous,
is really wanted to remind us of
the abyss which the imagination is
spanning:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>It was the rampart of God's house</q></l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>That she was standing on,</l>

<l>So high that, looking downward thence,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'><q rend='post'>You scarce might see the sun.</q></l>
</lg>

</quote>

<p>
<q>The tides of day and night</q> alternate
far down in the abyss beneath
her feet, where the earth is spinning
about the sun <q>like a fretful midge.</q>
If any one is tempted to doubt if the
heavens of modern science, with their
<pb n='266'/><anchor id='Pg266'/>
vast distances and harmonious order,
are more poetical than the star-spangled
cope upon which the Chaldean
shepherds gazed, let him read
this poem. The simple imagery with
which Mr. Rosetti clothes the abysses
of heaven seems, without destroying
their immensity, to render them visible:

He sees that she is looking for him,
and then she speaks, not to him, for
she sees him not, but of him, of what
their life in heaven will be when he
has come&mdash;for he must come, she
says. And again, as she talks of the
life in heaven, it is Fra Angelico in
words; lush meadow-grass, so soft
to road-worn feet, and golden-fruited
trees, and tender intercourse from
which all the acerbities and conventionalities
of life are banished; an
atmosphere in which the freshness of
morning and the peace of evening
are woven into one eternal day,
which, as he says elsewhere, <q>hours
no more offend.</q> How thoroughly
Dantesque in its homely sublimity is
the conception of Our Lady and
her handmaids at their weaving:

<p>
We hardly think that this poem of
Mr. Rosetti's strikes a single false
chord even to Catholic ears. The
utmost that can be said is that the
blessed soul is too absorbed by her
longing for her earthly love. But
then the heaven of theology is an
assemblage of paradoxes which faith
alone can knit together; and, in its
entirety, wholly without the realm of
art. In this poem we have one aspect
of the life of the blessed, <q>securus
quidem sibi sed nostri solicitus,</q>
as S. Bernard says, presented
to us most vividly in the only colors
an artist's pencil can command&mdash;those
of earthly love. But this love is serene
and pure, and, despite its intensity,
free from all pain and impatience.
The passion is supplied by the refrain
in the earthly lover's heart, as
in his touching commentary upon
the confidence of her <q>we two</q> will
do thus and thus when he comes:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>Alas! we two, we two, thou sayst!</q></l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Yea, one wast thou with me</l>

<l rend='margin-left: 2'>To endless unity</l>

But soon the smile fades away as

<l rend='margin-left: 2'>The golden barriers,</l>
<l>And laid her face between her hands,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'><q rend='post'>And wept (I heard her tears).</q></l>
</lg>

</quote>

<p>
If it be objected that this is too gross
a violation of the state in which all
tears are wiped away, I answer, first,
that there are tears and tears; secondly,
that if anthropomorphism is allowable
in our realizations of God, <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>à
fortiori</foreign> is it allowable in our realizations
of those who, although they are
raised above the estate of humanity,
are still human. Again, even the
angels of Christian art have a prescriptive
right to tears, and is it not
written, Isai. xxxiii. 7, <q>Angeli pacis
amarè flebunt?</q>
</p>

<p>
And now we will say what we
have to say of perhaps the most
wonderful of all Mr. Rosetti's poems,
which somehow, for more reasons
than one, suggests itself as a pendant
<pb n='267'/><anchor id='Pg267'/>
to <q>The Blessed Damozel.</q> He
has called it <q>Jenny,</q> and Jenny is
the name&mdash;neither French nor Greek
will mend the matter&mdash;of a young
prostitute. We freely confess that
there are two or three lines in this
poem which we heartily wish Mr.
Rosetti had never written; but, take
it as it stands, few will be disposed to
deny that it is a very real sermon
against lust, all the more impressive
because it is indirect. The
story, such as it is, is this: A man,
young but not in his first youth, who
has been for some years settling
down to a student's life, throws his
work aside one evening, and goes
off to one of his old haunts. Having
spent half the night in dancing,
and being smitten with Jenny's
youthful beauty, he goes home with
her. She, poor thing, utterly tired, falls
dead asleep at supper, and he, watching
her, falls to moralizing, half cynically,
half tenderly, upon innocence
and lust and destiny, until at last
the pity of it all wholly possesses him
and kills every other thought. And
so musing till early dawn, till

Many a man would be fain to listen
to such a sermon who would reject
any other. For the preacher is no
missionary in disguise, but a fellow-sinner
converted in the presence of
his sin, if we may call it conversion;
at least, beaten down and overwhelmed
by the colossal horror and pity
of it, as a wild beast is tamed by a
prairie-fire.
</p>

<p>
Many beautiful things have been
said by non-Catholic poets of Our
Blessed Lady. Indeed, a very pretty
book might be made of these Gentile
testimonies, from Milton, Cowley,
Crashaw (before his conversion),
Wordsworth, Keble, and many others.
It would seem that Parnassus is as
one of the high places of Baal, where
the Spirit of the Lord rushes upon
the poet, whose eyes are opened and
he must needs bless her whom he
that blesseth <q>shall also himself be
blessed, and he that curseth shall be
reckoned accursed,</q> and he cries,
<pb n='268'/><anchor id='Pg268'/>
<q>How beautiful are thy tabernacles,</q>
O Mary, Mother of God, <q>as woody
valleys, as watered gardens near the
rivers, as tabernacles which the Lord
has pitched as cedars by the water-side.</q>
But with Mr. Rosetti it is
something more than this. One is
tempted to fancy that with his Italian
name he must have really inherited
an Italian's devotion to the Madonna.
His poem <q>Ave</q> is neither
more nor less than a meditation upon
the joyful, sorrowful, and glorious
mysteries of Our Lady's life, and it
breathes a devotion as tender and
sensitive&mdash;in a word, as Catholic&mdash;as
though it had been written by F.
Faber. We shall venture to transfer
the whole of it to our pages, for we
cannot otherwise justify what we
have said, and part of its specific
beauty is that it is in one breath:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
Ave.
</p>

<lg>
<l>Mother of fair delight,</l>
<l>Thou handmaid perfect in God's sight,</l>
<l>Now sitting fourth beside the Three,</l>
<l>Thyself a woman Trinity,</l>
<l>Being a daughter born to God,</l>
<l>Mother of Christ from stall to Rood,</l>
<l>And wife unto the Holy Ghost:&mdash;</l>
<l>Oh! when our need is uttermost,</l>
<l>Think that to such as death may strike</l>
<l>Thou wert a sister, sisterlike!</l>
<l>Thou head-stone of humanity,</l>
<l>Ground-stone of the great mystery,</l>
<l>Fashioned like us, yet more than we!</l>
<l>Mind'st thou not (when June's heavy breath</l>
<l>Warmed the long days in Nazareth)</l>
<l>That eve thou didst go forth to give</l>
<l>Thy flowers some drink that they might live</l>
<l>One faint night more amid the sands,</l>
<l>Far off the trees were as pale wands</l>
<l>Against the fervid sky; the sea</l>
<l>Sighed further off eternally</l>
<l>As human sorrow sighs in sleep.</l>
<l>Then suddenly the awe grew deep,</l>
<l>As of a day to which all days</l>
<l>Were footsteps in God's secret ways:</l>
<l>Until a folding sense like prayer</l>
<l>Which is, as God is, everywhere,</l>
<l>Gathered about thee; and a voice</l>
<l>Spake to thee without any noise.</l>
<l>Being of the silence: <q>Hail,</q> it said,</l>

<l>Did thy great sorrow dawn on thee&mdash;</l>
<l>And through his boyhood year by year</l>
<l>Eating with him the Passover,</l>
<l>Didst thou discern confusedly</l>
<l>That holier Sacrament, when He,</l>
<l>The bitter cup about to quaff,</l>
<l>Should break the bread and eat thereof?</l>
<l>Or came not yet the knowledge, even</l>
<l>Till on some day forecast in Heaven</l>
<l>His feet passed through thy door to press</l>
<l>Upon his Father's business?&mdash;</l>
<l>Or still was God's high secret kept?</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Nay, but I think the whisper crept</l>
<l>Like growth through childhood. Work and play,</l>
<l>Things common to the course of day,</l>
<l>Awed thee with meanings unfulfill'd,</l>
<l>And all through girlhood, something still'd</l>
<l>Thy senses like the birth of light,</l>
<l>When thou hast trimmed thy lamp at night</l>
<l>Or washed thy garments in the stream:</l>
<l>To whose white bed had come the dream</l>
<l>That He was thine and thou wert His</l>
<l>Who feeds among the field-lilies.</l>
<l>O solemn shadow of the end,</l>
<l>In that wise spirit long contain'd!</l>
<l>O awful end! and those unsaid</l>
<l>Long years when it was Finished!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Mind'st thou not (when the twilight gone</l>
<l>Left darkness in the house of John)</l>
<l>Between the naked window-bars</l>
<l>That spacious vigil of the stars?</l>
<l>For thou, a watcher even as they,</l>
<l>Wouldst rise from where throughout the day</l>
<l>Thou wroughtest raiment for his poor;</l>
<l>And, finding the fixed terms endure</l>
<l>Of day and night which never brought</l>
<l>Sounds of his coming chariot,</l>
<l>Wouldst lift through cloud-waste unexplor'd</l>
<l>Those eyes which said <q>How long, O Lord</q>?</l>
<l>Then that disciple whom he loved,</l>
<l>Well heeding, haply would be moved</l>
<l>To ask thy blessing in his name;</l>
<l>And that one thought in both, the same</l>
<l>Though silent, then would clasp ye round</l>
<l>To weep together&mdash;tears long bound,</l>
<l>Sick tears of patience, dumb and slow.</l>
<l>Yet, <q>Surely I come quickly,</q> so</l>
<l>He said, from life and death gone home.</l>
<l>Amen: even so, Lord Jesus come!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>But oh! what human tongue can speak</l>
<l>That day when death was sent to break</l>
<l>From the tired spirit like a veil,</l>
<l>Its covenant with Gabriel</l>
<l>Endured at length unto the end?</l>
<l>What human thought can apprehend</l>
<l>That mystery of motherhood</l>
<l>When thy Beloved at length renew'd</l>
<l>The sweet communion severèd&mdash;</l>
<l>His left hand underneath thine head</l>
<l>And his right hand embracing thee?</l>
<l>Lo! He was thine, and this is He!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Soul, is it Faith, or Love, or Hope,</l>
<l>That lets me see her standing up</l>
<l>Where the light of the Throne is bright?</l>
<l>Unto the left, unto the right,</l>
<l>The cherubim, arrayed, conjoint,</l>
<l>Float inward to a golden point,</l>
<l>And from between the seraphim</l>
<l>The glory issues for a hymn.</l>
</lg>

<l>O Mary Mother! be not loth</l>

Mr. Rosetti certainly does not affect
classical subjects. There is nothing
in his curious Treasury at all
corresponding to those most exquisite
of all Mr. Tennyson's poems, <q>Ulysses</q>
and <q>Tithonus.</q> In the few
instances in which he does handle
classical legend, it is always its quaint
reflection in the mediæval mind that
attracts him, as in <q>Troy Town,</q> but
he is at home everywhere. <q>Eden
Bower</q> and <q>Sister Helen</q> are like
and unlike enough for comparison.
They are both monologues of deadly
sin; the first is spite, the second
hate, set to music. The conception
of Lilith in <q>Eden Bower</q> is a monstrous
waif of rabbinical tradition.
She is a sort of woman-snake, supposed
to have been Adam's first wife
before the creation of Eve, and in
her jealousy of the wife who supplanted
her is found the origin of her conspiracy
with the king-snake of Eden
which brings about the Fall. The
poem is one prolonged musical but
most diabolical chuckle of Lilith
over the immortal mischief she is
about to perpetrate. She is indeed
all the while coaxing the serpent to
help her, but her tone throughout is
one of assured triumph. The woman
and the fiend are interwoven with
marvellous subtlety&mdash;a fiend's colossal
blasphemy and a woman's petty
spite. The fiend does not shrink
from declaring open war against
heaven.

How she wriggles and gasps and
hugs herself at the thought of the
woe she is to bring upon her victims,
gloating over every detail of their
desolate exile, and forecasting the
death of one son and the damnation
of another. Lilith after all is a fiend,
and, as a creation of art, a fiend is a
creature that lives and revels in wickedness
as a salamander was supposed
to inhabit fire, with a keen sense of
pleasure and without moral responsibility;
but in <q>Sister Helen</q> we have
something much more dreadful because
more human&mdash;<q>Hate born of
Love</q>&mdash;hate that has devoured all
love, even love of self&mdash;the hatred
that is despair. A ruined girl, dwelling
in a lonely tower with her little
brother, seeks vengeance upon her
seducer after the mediæval manner,
by consuming his waxen image before
the fire. And now upon the
third night she is nigh upon its
achievement, for the wax is wasting
fast. The child takes a child's interest
in the little figure that was once
so plump, but through which the
flame is now shining red. He prattles
about it, but understands nothing,
nor yet that there is anything to
understand. His sister coaxes him
out into the balcony to look out and
say what he sees, for she knows what
must come. And one after the other
the brothers and father of the dying
man ride up in the wild night and
implore her mercy, at first that she
will save his life, and then that at
least she will forgive and save him
from his despair, that body and soul
may not perish. There is something
simply appalling in the way in which
each entreaty, as it comes to her repeated
by her little brother's voice,
is slain by the calm, ruthless, sometimes
ironical comment in which she
conveys her refusal.

One is tempted to say of Mr. Rosetti
as was said of his patron Dante,
<q>Lo, he that strolls to hell and back
at will.</q> We speak advisedly of his
<q>patron Dante,</q> for his devotion to
his great namesake is of the intensest
kind. Almost the longest poem in
the volume is <q>Dante at Verona,</q>
in which every conceivable detail in
the poet's painful exile at that court
is dwelt upon with a solicitude that
reminds one of an early Christian
sponging up a martyr's blood. To
appreciate the poem thoroughly, one
ought to share with Mr. Rosetti in
the intimacy of the great Florentine.
There are, however, many exquisite
bits of description in it that must
come home to every one. Surely the
Gran Cane's jester will live for ever:

We cannot of course pretend to

But for the sake of quoting one stanza,
we must say a word of the <q>Staff

wronged innocence, finds himself,
whilst returning from Palestine,
in the land of a fair lady, which her
triumphant foemen are ravaging, and
where all hope of resistance is dead.
He goes out on her behalf, and conquers
and dies. This is the description

Nearly a third of Mr. Rosetti's
volume consists of sonnets. Now, a
sonnet should be grave but not heavy.
It must have a severity tempered
by sweetness like the breviary character
of the Venerable Bede. It must
linger meditatively; it must not loiter,
or fumble with its meaning. It must
be sinuous, never headlong; feeling
its rhymes delicately, not falling upon
them; for these are less rhymes than
the most prominent of many assonances,
upon all of which the rhythm
hangs. Indeed, the texture of the
sonnet resembles more that of blank-verse
than that of any other metre
we possess. Without denying the
perfection of some two or three of Milton's
sonnets, and perhaps in a lesser
degree of about as many of Wordsworth's,
we may be permitted to say
that among our sonnet-writers Milton,
as a general rule, is too fierce and
headlong, as Wordsworth says of him,
in words of praise which to our ears
suggest blame. In his hands, <q>the
thing became a trumpet</q>; whilst
<pb n='271'/><anchor id='Pg271'/>
Wordsworth has too poor a vocabulary
for a composition in which every
word ought to tell. Shakespeare's
sonnets are only sonnets in name.
They do not fall into two, or rather
one and a half, like an acorn and its
cup, but are simply short poems of
three independent stanzas of alternate
rhymes, the whole concluding
with a rhyming couplet. The Elizabethan
writers who used the genuine
sonnet&mdash;Sidney, Spenser, Drummond,
especially the last&mdash;attained, we cannot
help thinking, to a more exquisite
use of the sonnet than either Milton
or Wordsworth, although the beauty
of their sonnets is somewhat marred
by the twanging effect of the concluding
rhyming couplet to which
they persistently cling. Many of
Mr. Rosetti's sonnets strike us not
only as beautiful poems, but as very
finished specimens of the sonnet. He
seems to have attained to the Italian
delicacy of the best of the Elizabethan
sonneteers, without loss of originality
and force. He is, however,
perhaps rather too fond of fretting
the melody of his lines by a harsh
emphasis, which, effective enough in
a liquid medium like Italian, is rather
trying to the naturally broken music
of the English tongue. An example
of this may be noted in the sixth
line of the following very beautiful
sonnet. He has called it <q>Inclusiveness</q>&mdash;a
title with which we venture
to quarrel, for the phenomenon
described is not a quality of anything,
but a fact or law; we would
substitute, in spite of its technical
flavor, <q>Introsusception.</q>

<p>
Mr. Rosetti has adopted, as we
have already indicated, more fully
than a Catholic could approve, a
principle which is obtaining a very
dangerous prominence amongst the
rising generation of English poets,
that art is justified of her children&mdash;that
to the artist all things are chaste.
Thus inevitably there are some lines
one could wish unwritten, and more
that one would not have every one
read. Yet for all this the <emph>ethos</emph> of
the book is chaste and noble, nor do
we know any poet by whom purity
is more honestly appreciated and
worshipped. The volume is a remarkable
example of the extent to
which a love of the Madonna and
the ascetic inspiration of Dante can
counteract and restrain the growing
sensuousness of English poetry.
</p>

<p>
If Mr. Rosetti is sometimes obscure,
it is not that his touch is ever otherwise
than delicate and precise, but
because his art is rather the art of the
musician than of the painter. His
changes of key, so to speak, are so
<pb n='272'/><anchor id='Pg272'/>
swift and subtle, and the harmonies
with which the theme is clothed are
so manifold and so quaint, that his
compositions have sometimes the
difficulty of a sonata of Beethoven,
and require considerable familiarity
before their proportions can be grasped.
Indeed, we must confess that
there are passages the meaning of
which we despair of ever grasping
with any precision; we must be content
to accept them as a sort of hieroglyphic,
for splendor or purity, like
the scroll and lily-work of a mediæval
goldsmith. This is the more provoking,
as obscurity is not here, as often
in Mr. Browning's poems, covered
by an oracular use of certain crabbed
expressions, which at least indicate
the nut that is to be cracked, but
coexists with a diction consistently
pure and flowing.
</p>

<p>
Although we have compared Mr.
Rosetti's art to that of the musician
rather than to that of the painter,
we have been told that he is a painter
of a high order. Anyhow, his
fondness for painting is proved by
the number of sonnets which he has
made upon pictures, ancient and
modern. We cannot more fitly conclude
our review than with his sonnet,
<q>For our Lady of the Rocks, by
Leonardo da Vinci</q>:

<head>Visit To An Artist's Studio.</head>

<p>
I do not know if, outside his own
small circle of patrons and acquaintances,
any one has heard of
the artist Van Muyden. Yet hidden
talent is none the less a divine
gift because few know it; it gives a
more pathetic interest to a life to
know that it is a life harassed with
care, vexed by non-appreciation,
hampered with poverty. Perhaps
Van Muyden is only obscure because
he would not lower his art to
suit the dealers' terms or the public
taste. When I visited his studio,
he was settled in a small house
in the suburbs of Geneva, Switzerland.
His own appearance was
striking: the supple form, not very
tall, but very spare; the large eyes
that seemed to dart through you
and search your soul, the high forehead,
wrinkled and bald, told of a
man with an intellect higher than
that of his fellow-men, an ideal enthroned
beyond the region of which
they know the bearings, and of the
cares with which they can sympathize.
He was a man past the
prime of life, eager and enthusiastic&mdash;eccentric,
perhaps, as the
world's estimate goes; but who is
not?&mdash;I mean amongst those whose
characteristics are worth studying
at all. He wore over his vest
and trowsers an old brown dressing-gown,
suggestive of the appearance
one is used to connect with mediæval
scholars and seers. His forte
is not landscape-painting, and, indeed,
he seemed lost at Geneva, despite
the southern beauty of its environs,
for Van Muyden's predilections
were evidently for the representation
of the human kind. But
then, if it was man that he loved to
copy, it was not broad-cloth man,
sleek, respectable, decorous, well-off,
but man as you find him in Italy
or Spain&mdash;picturesque as his scanty
surroundings; an unconscious
artist, a born model; man imbued
with the spirit of the sun-god; man
carolling and trilling without effort,
believing himself born to sing
like the birds; man in himself a
study, a picture, a statue, a marvel.
</p>

<p>
Van Muyden explained his theories
very freely, and they were well
worth listening to.
</p>

<p>
<q>In the north, you see,</q> he said,
<q>an artist is forced, if he wishes to
be truthful, to copy a thousand
pitiful details of upholstery. Such
pictures are called <hi rend='italic'>genre</hi>; and this
realistic, mathematical accuracy,
utterly destructive of the picturesque,
is lauded to the skies; but,
good God! could not a Chinese do
as well with his wonderful imitative
faculty, altogether apart from the
<emph>feeling</emph> of art? The North makes up
for the picturesque by the comfortable;
what a compensation for the
artist! But modern art has more
<pb n='274'/><anchor id='Pg274'/>
to contend with than vitiated taste
or the loss of that free and natural
life which in simpler times was
more conducive to artistic inspiration;
we have to struggle on without
a school or a standard of taste.
We no longer have those centres
where the traditions of art were religiously
kept; those high-priests who
gathered round them numerous and
docile disciples, as of old the Athenian
philosophers in the groves of
Academe. Even in Italy, in Rome
itself, no such centre can be found.
A young artist has to make his
own solitary way, pursue his ideal
alone, keep up his enthusiasm by
his own unaided exertions, and
probably find neither patron nor
master to care for his works or
guide his attempts.</q>
</p>

<p>
The artist was surely right; for
the great schools of painting were to
art what the religious orders are to
the church&mdash;centres towards which
a vague vocation may be directed
and find its true mission, with
brethren to share its enthusiasm
and superiors to guide its aspirations.
Most of his pictures were
Italian scenes, some domestic, but
mostly treating of the monastic
life. The cool cloister, with its ilex
or orange-trees seen cornerwise
through the railings; the old portico,
with a monk seated in meditation
on the fragment of a sculptured
pillar: the noon-day siesta; the begging
friar coming home with his
sack of food; the preacher starting
meekly, staff in hand, for the distant
station where he is to preach
a Lent; the novice arranging the
altar; the monk digging his own
grave in the sunny cloister, or washing
the altar-plate in the sparkling
fountain, etc. etc.&mdash;such were chiefly
the subjects chosen. Why? He
was not a Catholic, this artist; but
it seems to have come to him intuitively
that there is more room for
artistic expression and artistic liberty
in things pertaining to the
old church. His own studio was
as perfect a picture as any he could
have painted; a treasure-house of
antiquities carelessly displayed. It
was lighted by two immense windows,
one of which was shaded by
a sort of slanting tester, throwing
the light on the easel in the middle
of the room. Between these windows
stood a nondescript piece of
furniture in carved oak, very black
and old&mdash;a species of <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>secrétaire</foreign>, with
an <q>extension</q> holding a small
washing-bowl, surmounted by a
dolphin's head, which was crowned
for the nonce with a scarlet <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>berrétta</foreign>.
Large jars of old porcelain were
placed here and there, either on the
ground or on substantial <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>étagères</foreign>,
and two corners of the room were
filled with high chests equally carved,
on whose capacious tops rested a
medley of distaffs, horns, helmets,
old swords, a spinning-wheel, and a
confused mass of tattered garments
or drapery, dingy and time-stained,
crimson cloaks, blue tunics,
purple veils, etc. An array of pipes,
hooked into the wall for security,
stood on the high mantel-piece,
together with one of those common
brass kitchen lamps in use at Rome,
with four projections enclosing
wicks, and whose shape has never
been altered since the days when
Nero rode in the arena and the
Christians went calmly to the stake.
On the unoccupied spaces on the
wall hung the artist's pictures,
some few representing touching
family scenes (all Italian) strewed
among the monastic subjects.
Right in the centre of the ceiling
hung a movable apparatus, in which
was placed a lamp&mdash;modern, alas!
This came down quite close to the
easel, and gave all the light required
<pb n='275'/><anchor id='Pg275'/>
for night-work. A carved table
with curiously-twisted legs, and two
high-backed mediæval arm-chairs
covered with tapestry, completed
the furniture, besides a green baize
stage for the models. This reminded
me of the <foreign rend='italic'>palco</foreign> used for
preaching in Italian churches, even
when there is a proper pulpit;
some of my readers may remember
these miniature stages, raised about
five feet from the floor, and on
which the excited orator can promenade
like a lion in his cage while
hurling his burning periods at his
awe-stricken listeners. Van Muyden
has a wife and nine children,
which fact we ascertained through
the reply to a question prompted
by the enormous quantity of under-linen
hung out to dry on the balusters
outside the studio. We did
not see Mme. Van Muyden, and
were thankful we did not; for such
a reckless display of household secrets
must argue a woman whose
appearance would frighten romance
out of the veriest sentimentalist
that ever lived. So we speculated
in silence on this domestic guardian
of the artist's peace&mdash;an excellent
and worthy woman, no doubt, a capital
house-keeper, a careful mother,
a faithful wife, but scarcely a help-mate,
a companion, a Beatrice, to
her husband. How few men of sensitive
nature, high-strung character,
aspiring organization, have fit wives!
Why is it that they generally take
a fancy to peculiarly unsuitable
women? Is it that they are so soft-hearted
that they cannot resist the attraction
of the first pretty face they
see, or so rapt above the reach of common
interests that they form, as it
were inevitably, an incongruous union,
and only wake up to find themselves
irretrievably tied to a showy
slattern, or a plodding, unappreciative
housewife? What perverse fairy
casts her spell on the poor artist's
marriage-day, and makes of the
chime of his wedding-bells the knell
of his possible fame?
</p>

<p>
Poverty is the safest ladye-love
for an artist, as one of Dante's
friends was always telling him.
Artists and scholars are the Francis-of-Assisiums
of the intellectual
world, and the same bride as that
spiritually wooed by the heroic
voluntary beggar, is the most fitting
companion for them. With her,
at least, they can enjoy the perfect
freedom from care which alone
makes want supportable; they can
throw around their destitution that
halo of romance which the prosaic
details of a household invariably
strangle out of existence. But in
the early choice of a wife more
hopes go down, more aspirations
are smothered, than those whose
aim is worldly success and the favor
of the great. The ideal is the victim
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>par excellence</foreign>; for the struggling
artist, tied by his own hasty imprudence
to a woman of inferior mould,
soon feels the spark of genius die
within him; the incentive to <q>do
and dare</q> has dwindled down to
the necessity of <q>earning and eating.</q>
A woman with uncomprehensive
soul peevishly reminds
him at every moment of the world
of matter, without even offering him
the compensation of a blind and
admiring worship of his talents in
his own peculiar sphere; in short,
he is a living example of the adage,
<q>A man that's married is a man
that's marred.</q>
</p>

<p>
Far be it from me to bring this
reproach on any particular individual;
but such was the train of
thought naturally induced by the
unsightly array of house-linen hung
like delusive flags of truce on the
balusters of the artist's home.
Early marriage is undoubtedly
<pb n='276'/><anchor id='Pg276'/>
best for the generality of men in
the world, but it is intellectual
ruin to artists. Let us wish them
the rare fortune of a wife that will
be a real helpmate to their higher
and better selves, a staff to lean on
up the thorny road to Parnassus,
and then recommend early marriage;
but unless such exceptions be found,
let them beware of the fate typified
by the prosaic decoration of Van
Muyden's abode at Geneva.

<head>A Word For Women.</head>

<p>
By One Of Themselves.
</p>

<p>
It has been urged that women
should refrain from writing for the
public, and busy themselves with
interests more strictly within their
own domain than those of literature.
The demand might claim
respectful notice, if all women
would give heed to it. Since they
will not, is there any reason why
those who employ their pens in
the production of sensational stories
and other demoralizing works
should have the field all to themselves?
Or is it right that others
of equal ability should shrink from
entering it in defence of religion
and morality?
</p>

<p>
The space is ample for all combatants.
Our learned and venerable
doctors, stern champions of
truth, who keep their logical and
polemical lances ever poised to
strike the foe, to demolish error,
and force conviction upon minds
firmly closed against less cogent
weapons, need not fear being jostled
by humble handmaidens of
the same mistress, who have ventured
within the lists. These may
do good service, also, with a large
class whom their telling blows
shall fail to reach.
</p>

<p>
Our women and youth, who will
read and be influenced for good or
evil by <q>feminine literature,</q> cannot
be amused with metaphysical
discussions that gain an attentive
hearing from men of philosophical
tastes, or even by moral essays and
reflections, however excellent and
edifying.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, it is not a question
of forming the tastes of readers.
Alas! these are already formed
by a vitiated literature, flowing
from a godless system of education,
and carrying the poison through
the whole length of its course.
</p>

<p>
The only question is, Where
shall the antidote be found, and
how administered? Certainly not
in moral lectures that will not be
read, or in fiction of the goody-goody
sort.
</p>

<p>
Our only hope&mdash;and it is a bright
one&mdash;for the future of our young
Catholics lies in the blessed awakening&mdash;effected
by the clear tones
of that infallible voice which never,
in any age, gave forth an uncertain
sound&mdash;that is causing schools for
Christian culture to spring up
through the whole length and
breadth of our country. But what
for our children of a larger growth,
whose tastes are already perverted?
</p>

<p>
We think it is unquestionable
that, as the daughters of the first
Eve, according to the flesh, have
aided powerfully in commending
the forbidden fruit to the lips of a
deluded public, so the daughters
of the second Eve, according to the
spirit, may do much to remedy the
consequences of the fatal banquet.
</p>

<p>
There are certain influences exercised
almost exclusively by women.
There are certain subjects
to the consideration of which the
flexibility of her nature enables her
to bend her efforts with graceful
success, and to far better purpose
than the <q>stern masculinity</q> of
man's heart, head, and pen can
compass.
</p>

<p>
Well, then, if women <emph>may</emph> write,
<pb n='278'/><anchor id='Pg278'/>
it behooves them to treat of such
matters, and in such manner, as
shall secure readers. For our people
must and will read. Right
or wrong, it is a necessity of the
age. From the abodes of wealth
and leisure, in the metropolis of
fashion, to village homes and rural
firesides, our people must and will
read. Happy for them if the
nourishment their fevered imaginations
so morbidly crave be at least
harmless! A highly-seasoned sensational
literature has stimulated
the craving to a degree of frenzy,
if not to actual organic disease;
happy, indeed, for them could such
mental pabulum, such agreeable viands
and cooling fruits, be furnished
and accepted as would
gradually assuage the wild thirst
for excitement, until wholesome
correctives should become palatable!
</p>

<p>
To secure success in tilling the
field from which so desirable a harvest
is to be gathered, the most
conscientious writers must be content,
however they may deplore the
necessity, to sharpen their plough-shares
in the camps of these Philistines
of literature. With no blunt
implement can the soil be compelled
to yield such harvest.
</p>

<p>
We may furnish entertaining and
edifying biographies, and gain a few
readers. For this department women
are by nature peculiarly fitted,
if they will guard against the tendency
to exaggeration which is
their besetting sin. But for one
reader of such a book there will be
fifty, even among Catholics, who
will prefer the demoralizing trash
in cheap newspapers and dime
novels to the best biography that
can be produced.
</p>

<p>
Truth should be presented in a
sharp and, to use a phrase of the
times, <emph>taking</emph> way which shall compel
a hearing. The popular absurdities
and glaring depravities of
this <q>enlightened XIXth century</q>
should be set forth with vehement
energy and convincing force.
</p>

<p>
It is no shadow, but a real, all-pervading,
soul-destroying power
with which the Christian athlete of
this day is brought into close conflict.
The foe must be met by an
attitude as firmly hostile to its evil
enticements as it assumes against
all good influences. <q>Beating the
air</q> will win no victory. Seeking
to compromise or modify the stern
principles of eternal truth held and
proclaimed by the Catholic Church
from first to last will only ensure
defeat.
</p>

<p>
If our women join in the struggle
to resist the forces of infidelity
which threaten to overwhelm our
sons and daughters in temporal and
eternal ruin, and, in their zealous
enthusiasm, step beyond the sphere
of domestic privacy and humble retirement
that is happily their own;
if some literary Judith even throws
off for the moment the delicate tenderness
of her sex, and seems to
pass the limits of female decorum
to strike off the head a leading
Holofernes, let us not cry, Out upon
her for such unwomanly act! Let
us reflect that it would have been
more in accordance with her nature
and inclination to have remained
quietly in her sequestered home
and at her ease, if she could have
forgotten the fearful interests that
were at stake.
</p>

<p>
What woman could look on with
apathy when husband, brother, or
child was exposed to certain death,
from which her strongest effort
might possibly snatch the dear one,
or listen to the remonstrance that
it was unbecoming and improper
for a woman to put forth such effort,
and that it must prove a very
<pb n='279'/><anchor id='Pg279'/>
feeble and faulty one at the best?
And shall we ask her to fold her
hands in ease, and remain silent
in fitting retirement, when the
souls of her beloved are exposed
to eternal death? No; it is her
inalienable right to speak and act
when by word or deed she may
possibly rescue souls.
</p>

<p>
Should sentiments of mere human
feeling, and affections from
which it is most difficult to detach
the heart of woman, enter into, imbue,
and even control the means
she uses to promote interests dearer
than mortal life, she has nothing
to fear but the critics. Her heavenly
Judge will never condemn her
for using such weapons as he has
endowed her withal in his holy
cause.
</p>

<p>
Honey is sometimes better than
vinegar, feminine sentiment often
more effective than masculine wisdom,
and fervor always to be preferred
to apathy.
</p>

<p>
We need not fear that the Catholic
woman will be carried too far
by her fervent zeal in resisting the
<q>spirit of the age.</q> She can never
be led into the mistakes of the
so-called <q>strong-minded.</q> Our
vigilant and loving mother, the
Holy Catholic Church, arms her
daughters with invulnerable shields
against all fanaticism. She holds
also in her hands the power to
sanctify all influences by which
souls are attracted to her embrace;
to transmute all metals into gold.
</p>

<p>
If an appeal to the sentimental
and emotional element in the heart
of a stranger to her fold has drawn
the wanderer to her maternal bosom,
her gentle, all-prevailing inspiration
soon condenses feeling
into principle, and the romantic visionary
stands clothed in the panoply
of a martyr.
</p>

<p>
If fitting words bravely spoken
have called hither a soul from the
slough of transcendentalism, spiritism,
free love, or from the ranks of
the <q>strong-minded,</q> there is no
fear that it may prove less docile to
the genial influence than that of the
dreamer, or fail to be speedily invested
with all the delicate attributes
and simple dignity of the true
woman.
</p>

<p>
All honor to the Catholic women
in our own country and in Great
Britain who are striving, each in
her own way, to promote the interests
of a sound and truly Catholic
literature. When there were but
few of these in America, our sisters
beyond the Atlantic reached their
hands across the great waters to
rescue souls. It will be known
only at the great accounting day
how many they first attracted to
the consideration of eternal verities.
From that time they have increased
in number, and have continued to
enrich British Catholic literature
by their contributions, while encouraging
their American co-workers.
</p>

<p>
A feminine Catholic literature
may not be faultless, and yet gain
numerous readers, and prove a
power for good, not only within the
church, but beyond her pale. Women
are human, and therefore liable
to imperfection.
</p>

<p>
When we notice the faults of female
writers, we must not forget the
difficulties which encompass them.
Few American women who write
are exempt from a multitude of
vexatious household cares, or even
from kitchen drudgery. Many are
oppressed with poverty, have no
power to earn a subsistence but by
the pen, with helpless families dependent
upon their literary exertions.
Among the most favored,
scarcely one can be found who has
not some invalid&mdash;a husband, parent,
<pb n='280'/><anchor id='Pg280'/>
or child&mdash;who requires her attentions
by night and day. It may
be safely asserted that such literary
leisure as men devoted to these
pursuits ordinarily enjoy is unknown
to American women. With
all their disadvantages, the marvel
is, not that their performances
should be imperfect, but that they
have really accomplished so much
under the shadow of the crowding
cares and duties which surround
them in their various domestic relations.
</p>

<p>
Let them take courage, then, and
persevere in their laudable efforts,
striving diligently to make the productions
of their pens more and
more perfect. And to this end let
them bestow their cordial smiles
and most graceful bows of acknowledgment
upon their best friends&mdash;the
critics who will take the pains
to examine and pass honest and intelligent
verdicts upon their productions.
Acute criticism is the purging
fire of literature, without which
it would soon become overburdened
with nonsense. As the friend
who kindly admonishes us of our
faults is entitled to the warmest
corner in our hearts, so the critic
who frankly sets forth the defects
of any production may justly claim
the most sincere gratitude of its
author.

<p>
This pamphlet is worth reading by all
who are interested in hospitals. The need
of reformation in this branch of philanthropic
work is only too well proved.
The gentlemen and ladies who interest
themselves in the care of the sick poor
merit both honor and gratitude. All that
is written or done, however, by the most
zealous and disinterested persons who
seek to accomplish their end outside of
the Catholic Church only adds to the
evidence that the church alone is competent
to deal with great social evils and
miseries. The state is cold, selfish, and
merciless, except so far as it is Christianized.
Mercenaries are always lacking in
the qualities necessary to secure a truly
faithful and charitable care of the sick
and miserable. Division among those
who are seeking to carry out the precepts
of Christian charity, and the want of organization
and of religious institutions
among those who are out of the one true
church, paralyze their efforts. It is only
Christian unity which can give the proper
remedy for this lamentable state of
things, and without Catholic faith and
obedience this unity is impossible. Religious
orders are alone capable of carrying
out great works of charity, and they
cannot exist and flourish except in the
Catholic Church. If modern society does
not return to the bosom of the church, its
evils are incurable, however much individuals
may do in a partial way. Nevertheless,
these partial and imperfect efforts
ought to be encouraged; and during
this past winter we have had occasion to
admire and rejoice in the outflow of a
stream of beneficence upon our suffering
population in New York which has relieved
an immense amount of misery. In
so far as the special subject of this pamphlet
is concerned, it is obvious that the
erection of a new Bellevue Hospital is
imperatively demanded, and we trust that
it will be accomplished.

<p>
Goethe somewhere remarks that many
of an author's best thoughts are to be
found in his letters to his intimate friends;
written, not for the public, not for fame
but from the strong desire to communicate
that which is most living within him
to a kindred spirit.
</p>

<p>
In the confidential correspondence of
great minds there is a yet greater charm.
We feel a kind of personal interest in men
who have exercised great intellectual
power over us; they become our heroes,
and we endow them with imaginary qualities,
<pb n='282'/><anchor id='Pg282'/>
from lack of more certain information
concerning them. The minutest
details in their lives become to us affairs
of moment. How they looked, how they
dressed, what they thought about the
most trifling subjects, seem to us to be
matters worthy of becoming a part of
history. There is a still higher interest
in the story of the unfolding of a powerful
intellect. It contains a lesson in psychology
more instructive than any which
can be learned from abstract treatises on
this subject. This it is that gives the chief
value to autobiographies of philosophers,
poets, and theologians. Yet an autobiography
can never be a mirror in which
we may behold the workings of the human
mind. It is an after-thought, a reflex
judgment, the expression of what
men now think they once felt or thought.
It does not give us the process of intellectual
growth, but a theory concerning
what that process must have been; and
a theory formed by the individual concerning
the flux and reflux of the currents
of his own life can never be wholly
trustworthy. Autobiography is necessarily
subject to all the vices inherent in
special pleading.
</p>

<p>
The truest history of the intellectual
and moral development of a man is to be
found in his letters to his intimate friends.
There we have, not what in after-years he
thinks he thought and felt, but what he
really did think and feel; and in this
view of the matter, the egotism which is
always so prominent in letters to friends
gives them an additional value. Instead
of being offended with the writer for
talking so much about himself, we are
grateful for the weakness which gives
us a truer insight into his character.
</p>

<p>
These considerations will prepare our
readers for a favorable criticism upon the
volume before us. Few men have lived
to whom we more gladly give the homage
of admiration and respect than to Charles
de Montalembert; and though we strongly
condemn certain words which he uttered
when his mind was troubled by
suffering and disease, and which, had he
lived longer, he himself would have been
the first to wish unsaid, he was yet so
great a man that we willingly forget that
he made this blunder.
</p>

<p>
These <hi rend='italic'>Letters</hi>, of which Mr. Audly has
given us an excellent English translation,
were first published in the <hi rend='italic'>Contemporain</hi>
(June, 1872, to March, 1873).
</p>

<p>
They run from 1827 to 1830, and, as the
work of a youth from his seventeenth to
his twentieth year, are of course fresh,
frank, and ardent; but they also reveal
in the future orator and historian a depth
of feeling and a command of language
rarely to be met with in one of so tender
an age.
</p>

<p>
They are addressed to M. Léon Cornudet,
whom Montalembert calls the friend
of his soul, his dearest friend; to whom
he is bound by a common sympathy in
every noble feeling and high aim; whom
nor time nor absence can make him
even for one moment forget. What chiefly
strengthens him in his faith in the permanency
of this friendship is the fact that
it is based on religion, which becomes
the immortal mediatrix between his soul
and that of his friend.
</p>

<p>
When he travels and contemplates the
beauties of nature, his only regret is that
his friend is not near him; when he reads
a poem, and his soul is borne aloft on
the wings of inspiration, he exclaims,
<q>Oh! if he were but here to share my
delight.</q> He never dreams of the future,
of battling for religion and freedom,
of victories won and defeats nobly borne,
that he does not behold his friend by his
side; and when, picturing to himself the
vicissitudes of life, he imagines that possibly,
in spite of his high resolves and
strong purposes, he may fail, may be
doomed to obscurity and the contempt
of the world, he seeks for consolation in
the thought that in the heart of his friend
he will find a better world.
</p>

<p>
His friend is, as it were, his other self,
which gives to him a twofold life; making
him feel always that <q>joy was born
a twin,</q> and that all who joy would win
must share it, and that sorrow, too, longs
to pour itself into the heart of love.
</p>

<p>
This strong friendship&mdash;<q>the only impulse
of the soul admitting of excess</q>&mdash;which,
like a thread of gold, runs through
all these letters, wins at once our sympathy
and our confidence.
</p>

<p>
There is something noble and great in
the youth who is capable of such pure
and deep love. After all, it is the heart
that reaches highest and deepest, and
through it man attains to the best.
</p>

<p>
Of course there is in these letters much
that is immature; were it not so, they
would not be the letters of a mere boy;
but the infinite faith in the possibility of
divine realities even on earth, the lofty
contempt for what is mean and ignoble,
the self-confidence that never doubts of
<pb n='283'/><anchor id='Pg283'/>
itself, the restless activity that no work
satisfies, the boundless craving for knowledge,
the freshness of the heart that falls
like dew upon every lovely thing, giving
it health and beauty&mdash;all this so charms
and delights us that we have no eye for
defects.
</p>

<p>
<q>A contempt for life,</q> he writes to his
friend, <q>is, in my opinion, the finest privilege
of youth. As we grow older, the
more we cling to a frail existence which
becomes a burden to ourselves and to
others.</q>

Young Montalembert, with wealth and
noble birth, which gave him the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>entrée</foreign> of
the highest circles, found no charm in
what is called society. His mind was too
serious, his ambition too lofty, to permit
him to throw away the precious time of
youth in frivolous amusements.
</p>

<p>
<q>People usually say,</q> he writes to his
friend during the summer vacations of
1827, <q>that in youth we ought to give ourselves
up to the pleasures of society.
In my opinion, this amounts to downright
absurdity. I should think that in youth
we ought to plunge into study or
into the profession we wish to embrace.
When a man has done his duty towards
his country; when he can come
before the world with laurels won in the
senate or on the field of battle, or at
least when he enjoys universal esteem;
when, again, he is sure of commanding
universal esteem and respect, then I
can understand that he has a right to
enjoy himself in society, and to mix in it
with assurance.</q>
</p>

<p>
Montalembert had a passion for labor,
which is the only sure road to excellence
and power, and which is also the greatest
evidence of ability.
</p>

<p>
We find him, when not yet ten years
old, shut up in his grandfather's library,
acting as his secretary, helping him in
the designs of his geographical maps,
and absorbed in the study of the great
English orators; and later, at college, giving
up his recreations, and devoting fifteen
hours a day to the severest mental discipline.
By saving five minutes every
morning in his cell at Sainte-Barbe out
of the time allowed to the pupils for rising
and dressing, he managed in one
year to translate a whole volume of
Epictetus. He spent a portion of the
summer vacation of 1827 at La Roche-Guyon,
the country-seat of the Duc de
Rohan; and though the castle was filled
with guests, for whom the duke provided
every kind of amusement, this intrepid
young worker is able to write the following
lines to his friend:
</p>

<p>
<q>While you are idling your time away,
pray just hear what I shall have read
during my month's residence at La
Roche: in the first place, all Byron,
which is no trifling job; Delolme, on the
<hi rend='italic'>British Constitution</hi>&mdash;a capital and highly
important work; the whole of the <hi rend='italic'>Odyssey</hi>,
twenty-four cantos, at the rate of one
a day; Thomson, Cowper, Pliny's <hi rend='italic'>Letters</hi>;
the <hi rend='italic'>Lettres Provinciales</hi>; the <hi rend='italic'>Life of
S. Francis Xavier</hi>, by Bouhours, which
the duke obliged me to read; three volumes
of the <hi rend='italic'>Mercure</hi> newspaper; and,
lastly, the poetical part of the Greek <hi rend='italic'>Excerpta</hi>.</q>
</p>

<p>
Even in Stockholm, whither he went
in 1828 with his father, who had been
appointed French ambassador to the
court of Sweden, he is able, in the midst
of the endless and tiresome routine of
court etiquette, to devote six or seven
hours a day to study. <q>In the morning,</q>
he writes, <q>I read Kant, whom I study
deeply, not finding him over-difficult in
the beginning. At night I plod in detail
over Northern history. In the afternoon
I devote all the time I can catch to my
correspondence, to reading a few German
poems and novels, and to certain
statistical or political studies.</q>
</p>

<p>
Not content with working himself, he
seeks to rouse the flagging energies of
his friend by pointing out to him' what
great things he may be able to do for
God and his country. The ruling passion
in Montalembert's heart, in these
early years as during his whole life, was
the love of the church and of freedom.
</p>

<p>
<q>Religion, liberty,</q> he writes&mdash;<q>such
are the eternal groundworks of all virtue.
To serve God, to be free&mdash;such are our
duties. In order to fulfil them, we must
use every resource, every means, which
Providence has placed in our hands.</q>
And again: <q>I have succeeded in preserving
my faith in the midst of one hundred
and twenty infidels; I hope that God
<pb n='284'/><anchor id='Pg284'/>
will not allow me to lose my independence
of mind in the midst of half a dozen
absolutists.</q>
</p>

<p>
And then he pictures to himself the
great good which might be accomplished
by a writer who, bidding defiance to the
prejudices of youth and the public, would
raise a bold and eloquent voice in defence
of freedom and the church. <q>What
a noble part he would have to play!</q> he
exclaims. <q>What blessings he would
confer upon mankind! What services
he would render to religion! Ah! wherefore
has not God deigned to give me
talent? With what passionate ardor I
would have embraced such a glorious future!</q>
Who does not perceive here how
the thoughts of the boy were father to the
deeds of the man?
</p>

<p>
No author of our time has written more
feelingly or eloquently of Ireland than
Montalembert. He was drawn to her by
a double attraction&mdash;he loved her for her
faith, and he sympathized with her because
she was wronged. The finest portion
of his history of <hi rend='italic'>The Monks of the
West</hi> is that devoted to the Irish saints.
Nothing could be more beautiful or
more consoling than the noble pages
which he has devoted to this subject. As
his <hi rend='italic'>Histoire de Sainte Elisabeth</hi> opened a
new path across the vast field of Catholic
history, his studies on S. Columba and
S. Columbanus called attention to the
wealth of religious poetry and Christian
example which was suffered to remain
buried in the archives of the early Irish
Church. In these letters we perceive the
first awakening of his love for Ireland,
and are able to trace the causes which
led him to study the history of that most
interesting but unhappy land.
</p>

<p>
<q>By reading the admirable speeches
of Grattan,</q> he writes in 1828, <q>I have
discovered, as it were, a new world&mdash;the
world of Ireland, of her long-sufferings,
her times of freedom and glory, her sublime
geniuses, and her indefatigable
struggles. The universal interest now
felt for Ireland, and the remarkable circumstances
in which she is placed at
present, have tempted me to unfold before
the eyes of those Frenchmen who care
for Ireland the highly interesting annals
and the sundry revolutions of her history.
My Irish parentage on my mother's side,
my deep knowledge of English, and my
acquaintance with several families in that
country have confirmed my first ideas on
this matter, and I have determined upon
writing a history of Ireland from the year
1688, and to do it as soon as possible, in
order that it may be published, if that
can be done, before the vital question of
the emancipation is solved. There is
perhaps no country presenting such a
plentiful harvest of events equally interesting
and unknown.</q>
</p>

<p>
Montalembert was in Sweden when he
wrote this letter, and he at once sent to
England for books, that he might without
delay set to work on his proposed history
of Ireland. In addition to this, he
proposed at the end of the year to visit
Ireland itself, that he might consult libraries
and make a thorough study of
the people and country. This somewhat
ambitious project of the youthful Montalembert
led to no other immediate results
than an article on Ireland in the
<hi rend='italic'>Revue Française</hi>, and a journey to the
Emerald Isle in 1830; but to it we are no
doubt in part indebted for the eloquent
chapters on the Irish Saints in <hi rend='italic'>The
Monks of the West</hi>. His first letter from
Ireland to his friend is full of the enthusiasm
with which the history of that country
had inspired him:
</p>

<p>
<q>As for the Irishwomen,</q> he writes,
<q>they are bewitching. They form the
most beautiful female population I ever
beheld. But I reserve all my remarks
on the country and the people for our
conversations in Paris. For the present
I must simply beg of you to pray that
my passion for Ireland may not become
criminal, for it threatens really to lead
me astray from the lawful object of my
affections; and I am but too often tempted
to turn away my thoughts from our
France to a country so completely responding
to my beliefs, my tastes, and
even my most trifling prepossessions.</q>
</p>

<p>
He visited the county Wicklow in September,
1830, and wrote to his friend from
the <q>meeting of the waters in the vale of
Avoca.</q> <q>No, never,</q> he exclaims, <q>in
France, England, the Netherlands, or
even in Germany, have I met with anything
comparable to the wild and picturesque
defiles of this Wicklow County....
Only figure to yourself the grandest
and yet the most lovely landscape; torrents
abounding in numberless cascades,
struggling to make their way through
perpendicular rocks; forests of almost
fabulous depths; meadows and swards
full worthy of the Emerald Isle; and then
old abbeys, modern residences, and lodges
built in the purest Gothic style. Place,
<pb n='285'/><anchor id='Pg285'/>
moreover, in such a landscape, the most
pious, most cheerful, most poetical population
in the world. Then, again, say to
yourself that Grattan passed his childhood
here; that he meditated his speeches
along these torrents; that one of these
residences was bestowed on him by his
fatherland, and that therein he lived in
his old age; that all these beautiful lands
were sanctified and immortalized by the
Rebellion of 1798. Well, figure to yourself
all this, and you will still have but a
faint idea of what I have felt for the last
few days.</q>
</p>

<p>
As in his eyes Irishwomen were the
most beautiful, and Irish scenery the
most lovely, he was prepared to admire
enthusiastically the men of the country.
At Carlow College he dined with the
celebrated Bishop Doyle and several of
his professors, who, he says, received him
with a truly Homeric hospitality.
</p>

<p>
<q>I really don't know,</q> he writes, <q>which
I ought to admire most, the people or the
clergy. I feel confounded at the sight
of this people, equally faithful&mdash;as I said
in my article, whilst myself hardly believing
it&mdash;equally faithful to its old misery
and to its old faith, who, of all the
possessions of their forefathers, have preserved
nothing but their religion, the
only relic snatched from the conqueror,
without ever allowing themselves to be
carried away by the invincible attraction
of imitation.... As for the priests,
they are all model priests&mdash;manly, open,
cheerful, energetic. No hypocrisy, no
assumed reserve, to be read on their candid
and serene countenances; they talk
of freedom with all the buoyancy of a
Paris school-boy, and of their country, of
their dear and unfortunate Ireland, with
an accent that would melt a heart of
stone. One can see that over their hearts
religion and patriotism hold equal sway.
Indeed, in order to comprehend fully
what patriotism is, one must hear an
Irish priest talk of his country.</q>
</p>

<p>
It is a mistake to affirm, as has been
done, that Montalembert made this journey
to Ireland merely, or chiefly even
from a desire to see O'Connell.
</p>

<p>
The great Liberator had indeed fired
his young heart with enthusiasm, and he
rode sixty miles through a dreary country
to have the pleasure of talking with
him; but from these letters it is evident
that a feeling, higher and more general
than any which could be inspired by an
individual, however great, had drawn him
to the Isle of Saints. At Derrynane he
found O'Connell, surrounded by his
twenty-three children and nephews, looking
like a plain country farmer. <q>I was
struck,</q> he writes, <q>but not dazzled, by
him. He is by no means the most interesting
object in Ireland.</q>
</p>

<p>
He heard O'Connell speak, and, in spite
of his enthusiastic and impressionable
nature, was disappointed.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is but a demagogue,</q> he tells his
friend, <q>and by no means a great orator.
He is declamatory, inflated, full of bombast;
his arguments are loosely strung
together; his fancy is devoid of charm or
freshness; his style harsh, rough, and
choppy. The more I see of him, the
more I hear him, the more I am confirmed
in my first opinion&mdash;to wit, he is not
stamped with the mark of genius or with
true greatness. But he defends the finest
of all causes. He has before him no
mighty antagonist or rival, and circumstances&mdash;as
is the case with many
others&mdash;will stand him in lieu of genius.</q>
</p>

<p>
We have given our readers but a faint
idea of the warmth, and glow, and freshness
that pervade these letters; of the
frank and unaffected candor with which
their youthful author lays open his whole
heart to his friend; of the deep spirit
of religion and reverence which runs
through them; of the noble sentiments
and generous resolves which, as from an
inexhaustible fountain, well up from
young Montalembert's heart. In reading
them, we have felt our own heart grow
younger and kindle with new fire; we
have seemed to catch the accent of the
olden time, when men lived for honor,
and were glad to die for faith and truth,
rather than the metallic tone of this age,
<q>when only the ledger lives, and when
only not all men lie.</q>
</p>

<p>
We know of no book which we would
more gladly see in the hands of our
Catholic youth who lack enthusiasm and
are without the courage which a noble
and high purpose in life can alone give.
</p>

<p>
They need the education which will
lift them above low and petty aims, and
cause them to take an interest in things
of an unselfish kind. They must learn
that worth is more than success, and
honor better than wealth; they must be
taught to outgrow the narrow, calculating
spirit of the huckster and the shopkeeper,
the disposition to sneer at enthusiasm
and to depreciate high principles of action;
and to this end we know of nothing
<pb n='286'/><anchor id='Pg286'/>
that is likely to contribute more effectually
than the example and writings
of such men as Montalembert, who devoted
the labor of a lifetime to high aims
and noble purposes; who loved the truth
for its own sake, and freedom, not for
himself alone, but for all men; who never
worshipped the rising sun or paid court
to success, but fought for the just cause
without stopping to reflect whether he
would win or lose.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us never forget,</q> said Montalembert,
towards the end of his life, speaking
to his friend&mdash;<q>let us never forget
that Rio, when we were young, cultivated
enthusiasm within our souls, and for
such a blessing we must be bound to
him by the deepest gratitude.</q> This
is a debt which many a Catholic to-day,
not in France alone, but throughout the
world, owes to Charles de Montalembert.

Of Sales.</hi> Gathered from his writings
and arranged in order by the Rev. Père
Huguet. Boston: Patrick Donahoe.
1874.
</p>

</quote>

<p>
This work is really beyond the scope
of the reviewer or the critic, as it is made
up wholly from the writings of a great
saint. To every one who knows the
works of S. Francis of Sales, it will be a
fresh pleasure to see such well-arranged
parts of them in an English dress. Père
Huguet has had the happy thought of
choosing from the saint's spiritual treatises
everything that could console the sorrowful,
strengthen the weak, and encourage
the doubtful. The translator made it a
labor of love to put these thoughts within
the reach of many millions of English-speaking
people. S. Francis has been
read and admired by every one, within
or without the church; and there is between
him and the modern mind a peculiar
sympathy which makes him essentially
welcome to men of our day. Non-Catholics
would call him a thoroughly
<emph>reasonable</emph> saint. Everywhere his counsel
will be found on the side of moderation.
The <q>smoking flax</q> and the <q>bruised
reed</q> need not fear him; his gentle touch
is the very thing they require. The care
with which Père Huguet has made this
compilation is apparent; for though the
sentences that compose one page may, as
he says, have been taken from twenty
various treatises, they all follow each
other in admirable order. The author
has also supplemented them with footnotes,
consisting of appropriate passages
from other spiritual writers, ancient and
modern, bearing on the same subjects as
those treated of by S. Francis. A few of
these notes are signed with no name, and
are probably the adapter's own. S. Francis
has a wonderful power of expressing
spiritual truths in little terse sayings that
might well be called proverbs. A few
quotations will give an idea of this peculiarity
of his style:
</p>

<p>
<q>Persecutions are pieces of the cross
of Jesus Christ; we should scruple very
much to allow the smallest particle of
them to perish.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is not with spiritual rose-bushes as
with material ones; on the latter, the
thorns remain and the roses pass away;
on the former, the thorns pass away and
the roses remain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is necessary that all these sentiments
should sink deep into our hearts,
and that, leaving our reflections and our
prayers, we should pass to our affairs
sweetly, lest the liquor of our good resolutions
should evaporate and be lost, for
we must allow it to saturate and penetrate
our whole soul; everything, nevertheless,
without strain of mind or body.</q>
</p>

<p>
Some very beautiful thoughts will be
found on death, and the sorrow of the
living for the loss of their dear ones; also
some merciful and encouraging conjectures
on the number of the saved, which
S. Francis thinks will be the greater
number of Christians.

There are several reasons which incline
us to speak favorably of this book
of poems. The first, perhaps, is the appearance
of its printed pages, which are
neatly executed upon tinted paper. We
notice, also, that the red on the edges does
not rub off on our fingers, which is a
great source of satisfaction to one who is
obliged to handle new books. On turning
the book over, it occurs to us that
green muslin does not form a pleasant
contrast with red edges; but as we notice
a gilded harp and shamrock on the cover,
the arrangement of color is perhaps intended
to be typical of the sentiments of
the authoress.
</p>

<p>
The book-noticer&mdash;for we shall not
claim the august title of critic&mdash;pauses
with instinctive reverence at sight of the
works of a poet, and, above all, of a
poetess. The rhymes must be either
good or bad. If good, how shall he condense
the ecstasies, the harmonies, of one
volume into the prosaic compass of a
notice? If bad, how shall he run the
risk of breaking by rude treatment the
strings of a lyre which is perhaps just
working into tune, or inflict a wound on
those gushing hearts which sing with
the birds or bubble with the brooks? In
the present instance, we are glad to be
able to say that the verses are not bad.
The writer has talent. While there is no
marked or striking originality in the subjects
chosen, and not much of deep and
moving pathos, there are many well-turned
and pretty stanzas, and at times
quite a wealth of imagery and illustration.
The lines on <q>The Nightingale,</q>
<q>To Cashel,</q> <q>The Wayside Shrine,</q>
will furnish instances of this; and the
volume will be found agreeable to lovers
of poetry. The writer deserves to be encouraged.
We wish her success in the
fortune of her volume.
</p>

<p>
There is, however, a tone in some of
the strains which grates somewhat upon
our ears. Although no one suffers from
the abuse of arbitrary power as greatly
as the holy church, it is not her spirit to
seek relief by violence, nor is this permitted
to her children, even under oppressive
tyranny, excepting when it promises
to be a true remedy. There is
much more to be feared in these days
from the spirit of lawlessness and rebellion
than from intelligent submission to
governments, even when imperfect in
form and unjust in practice. Our Holy
Father, while branding with his apostolic
eloquence the iniquities of which he is
the victim, has forbidden violent resistance,
<pb n='288'/><anchor id='Pg288'/>
for the time being, to the oppressors
of Italy. The Catholics of Germany, under
the most diabolical tyranny, have not
sought relief by agitating insurrection.
And while we do not propose to submit
to injustice, or to call bad things by
good names, we will never wilfully stain
our hands by unnecessary bloodshed.
Under these circumstances, the <q>Hymn
to Liberty,</q> page 39, strikes us as a piece
of heated declamation.

to the emancipation of Ireland as the
work of the sword, though highly gratifying
to martial spirits, will not wholly
commend themselves to those friends of
Ireland who are now seeking it by peaceful
means, and tread in the paces of the
great O'Connell. There is no beauty
without truth; and those who lose
sight of it, even in minor details, run the
risk of a false inspiration. We are glad
to notice, on the other hand, several
poems in the volume full of Catholic
thought and piety. As for the melodies,
harmonies, etc., before alluded to, those
who wish for them must lay aside our
notice and read the book.

<head>The Principles Of Real Being. VI. Principles of Nominal Realities.</head>

<p>
There are beings which are called
<hi rend='italic'>real</hi>, not because they have any
special reality of their own, but
only on account of their objective
connection with real beings. Thus
possibilities are called <q>real,</q> although
the things possible have no
formal existence and no actual essence;
relations are called <q>real</q>
when they have real terms and a
real foundation, although they are
not found to possess (unless they
be transcendental) any new and
special reality; distinction, too, is
called <q>real</q> from the reality of
those things that are distinct, although
distinction in itself is neither
a new thing nor aught of any
real thing. Hence possibility, relation,
and distinction are to be
looked upon as entities having
only a conventional reality, from
which their denomination of <q>real</q>
has been desumed. Let us therefore
inquire what are the principles
on which these nominal realities
depend.

<head>Principles of possible being.</head>

<p>It
has been proved, in one of our preceding
articles, that every created
being is constituted of an act, of a
potential term, and of their formal
complement. It is now to be observed
that an act, when conceived
as ready to be produced and to
actuate its term, is called a <q>first
act</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>actus primus</foreign>; whilst the same
act, when already produced and existing
in its term, is called a <q>second
act</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>actus secundus</foreign>. In
the same manner, the potential
term, or the potency, when conceived
as ready to be first actuated
by an act and to complete
it, is called a <q>first potency</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>potentia
prima</foreign>; whilst the same
term, when already actuated and
completing its act, receives the
<pb n='290'/><anchor id='Pg290'/>
name of <q>second potency</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>potentia
secunda</foreign>.<note place='foot'>These expressions are frequently employed
in philosophy, but are not applied in a uniform
manner by several writers. It is known that
<q>first matter,</q> or <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>materia prima</foreign>, usually
means matter without form, or potency without
act; and nevertheless it is not rare to find the
denomination of <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>materia prima</foreign> applied to the
matter which is in the bodies, and which is certainly
not without a form. We cannot enter
here into a discussion about this subject; but it
is obvious that, if we wish to be consistent and
avoid equivocation, we must carefully guard
against applying to anything actual the very
epithet we employ to characterize its contrary.</note>
</p>

<p>
When treating of being as possible,
it is evident that we cannot
consider its act as really actuating
a term; for such a real actuation
would immediately be followed by
the real actuality of the being.
Yet the quiddity of a possible being
is always conceived through
the same principles and the same
ratios through which the quiddity
of the actual being is conceivable.
For a being is adequately possible
when an act is terminable or can
give existence, when a term is actuable
or can receive existence, and
when, from the concurrence of the
two, one complete actuality can
result. The act, the term, and the
complement are therefore implied
in the possible no less than in the
actual being; with this difference,
however: that in the actual being
the act and the term are actually
existing in one another, whereas
in the possible being the act and
the term are not really existing in
one another, but only mentally
conceived as ready to conspire
into one common existence. In
other words, in the actual being
the act is a <hi rend='italic'>second act</hi>, the term is
a <hi rend='italic'>second potency</hi>, and the complement
is a real and formal <hi rend='italic'>result</hi>;
whilst in the possible being the act
is a <hi rend='italic'>first act</hi>, the term is a <hi rend='italic'>first
potency</hi>, and the complement is a
mere <hi rend='italic'>resultability</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Hence the intrinsic possibility
of a being may be regarded under
two correlative aspects&mdash;that is
either as the terminability of a first
act, or as the actuability of a first
potency. Under the first aspect,
possibility involves a positive reality,
because it implies a real entity
which is eminently (that is, in a
more perfect manner) pre-contained
in the entity and power of its
cause. Under the second aspect,
possibility does not <emph>involve</emph> anything
positive&mdash;unless we speak of
the possibility of accidents, which
require a positive subject&mdash;but
only <emph>connotes</emph> something positive, to
wit, the first act by which the term
is to be formally actuated. Possibility,
under this second aspect,
and with reference to primitive beings,
is nothing else than the potentiality
with which we clothe
nothingness when we conceive it
as a term out of which beings are
educed by creation; for nothingness
thus conceived connotes the
act by which the non-existing term
can be brought into being.
</p>

<p>
Every possible being has, therefore,
a twofold incomplete possibility&mdash;the
<hi rend='italic'>formal</hi> and the <hi rend='italic'>material</hi>.
The formal consists in the terminability
of a first act; the material
in the actuability of its term;
while the complete and adequate
intrinsic possibility of the being is
a simple result of the concurrence
of the two.
</p>

<p>
It must be manifest, as a consequence
from the preceding remarks,
that a possible being is not
truly, but only <hi rend='italic'>nominally</hi>, real.
For its material possibility, or its
possible term, is only an entity of
reason, since it means nothing
more than a non-entity conceived
as liable to actuation; and its
formal possibility, or its possible
act, although involving, as we have
said, the notion of a positive reality
<pb n='291'/><anchor id='Pg291'/>
eminently contained in the entity
of the Creator, is still nothing
formally in that line of reality to
which we refer when we speak of
its possibility. Thus the possibility
of man, so far as it is eminently
contained in the entity of the Creator,
is no human entity at all, but
simply God's entity and power;
just as the possibility of velocity,
so far as it is eminently contained
in the entity of its cause, is no
formal velocity at all, but simply
the entity and power of the agent
by which the velocity can be
brought into being. Certainly, the
velocity with which a drop of rain
falls to the ground has no formal
existence in the earth which produces
it, but only in the drop itself;
it being evident that the attractive
power of the earth is not velocity,
but the principle of its production.
And the same is to be said of any
other effect inasmuch as it is eminently
contained in its efficient
cause. Nothing, therefore, that is
merely possible has any <emph>formal</emph> being
in its cause; whence it follows
that whatever is merely possible is
nothing more than an entity of reason&mdash;that
is, an unreality&mdash;whether
we consider its material or its
formal possibility. All entities, in
fact, of which the act and the term
are beings of reason, can have no
actuality but an actuality of reason.
Hence possible beings are themselves
only beings of reason, and
have no reality, either physical or
metaphysical. Why, then, are they
called <hi rend='italic'>real</hi>? Certainly not for
what they are, but simply because
their possibility is the possibility
<hi rend='italic'>of real beings</hi>. Many philosophers
are wont to style them <hi rend='italic'>metaphysical
realities</hi>; but this is a mistake, for
all metaphysical reality implies existence.
</p>

<p>
Possibles, as mere beings of reason,
have neither actuality nor
formal unity, except in intellectual
conception; whence it follows that
they do not constitute number, except
in intellectual conception.
This inference is evident. For
every multitude is made up of distinct
units; and therefore no real
multitude can be conceived without
real units really distinct. On
the other hand, possible beings are
not real, but conceptual, units, nor
are they really, but only mentally,
distinct from one another. As,
however, they are distinctly conceived,
and have a distinct ideal
actuality in the intellect that conceives
them, they constitute what
may be called an <hi rend='italic'>ideal</hi> multitude.
Such a multitude, as seen and exhaustively
comprehended by God's
intellect, is absolutely and positively
infinite; for possibilities are nothing
but the virtual degrees of
being which God's infinite reality
eminently contains, and which
God's infinite power can produce
outwardly. The range of possibilities
is therefore co-extensive with
God's infinity, and thus actually
comprises an infinite (not an <hi rend='italic'>indefinite</hi>)
multitude of distinct terms.
</p>

<p>
This infinite multitude is distinctly
and <emph>positively</emph> known to God
in the perfect comprehension of
his own infinite being, which is the
inexhaustible source of all possible
beings; to our intellects, however,
which cannot comprehend infinity,
the same infinite multitude is
known only <emph>negatively</emph>, inasmuch as
we understand that the multitude
of possible beings admits of no
limit whatever. We have, in fact,
no positive intuition of the infinite,
but acquire a notion of it by means
of abstraction only, as we remove
the limits by which any finite reality
directly perceived by us is circumscribed.
In other terms, our
<pb n='292'/><anchor id='Pg292'/>
notion of the infinite is not an intuitive
<emph>idea</emph>, as the ontologists assume,
but only an abstract <emph>concept</emph>.<note place='foot'>See <hi rend='smallcaps'>Catholic World</hi>, July, 1873, page 471.</note>
</p>

<p>
Thus far we have spoken of what
is called <emph>intrinsic</emph> possibility. Besides
this possibility, which is theoretical
and absolute, there is also a
relative possibility which is <emph>extrinsic</emph>
and practical. Extrinsically possible
we call that which is in the
power of some being to do. With
regard to God, all that is intrinsically
possible is also extrinsically
possible; for his omnipotence has
no bounds. With regard to creatures,
whose power is confined to
the production of accidental acts,
the range of extrinsic possibility is
very limited, since it is reduced to
acts of a determinate species, and
depends on extrinsic conditions.
Still, as the efficient power of created
substances is never exhausted
by exertion, creatures virtually contain
in their own power a multitude
of possible acts which has no limit
but that of the multitude of terms
or subjects which can be placed
within the sphere of their activity.
This amounts to saying that the active
power of creatures can be exerted,
not only successively, but
even simultaneously, in the production
of any number of accidental
acts of a certain kind. Thus the
attractive power of the sun sufficiently
accounts for the possibility
of innumerable movements which
can take place at any time and at
all times in any number of planets,
comets, or particles of matter
around it; so that the multiplication
of the effects does not require
the multiplication of the power, but
only that of the number of subjects,
or potential terms, in which the
acts proceeding from that power
must be received.
</p>

<p>
From what we have just said of
real possibility, it will be easy to
determine in what real impossibility
consists. Really impossible we
call that which cannot exist in nature.
Now, nothing can exist in
nature which is not an act completed
by a suitable term, or a term
actuated by a suitable act, or an
actuality resulting from the conspiration
of an act and a suitable term,
as we have shown in a preceding
article. That, therefore, is absolutely
and intrinsically impossible in
which this essential law of being is
not fulfilled. Thus passion without
action is absolutely and intrinsically
impossible, because a term cannot
be actuated without an act; whiteness
with nothing white is absolutely
impossible, because no mode of
being is conceivable where there is
no being; a material form actuating
an intellectual term is absolutely
impossible, because the one cannot
give that kind of reality which
the other should receive, and thus
they cannot conspire into one essence;
rotundity and triangularity
in the same subject are absolutely
impossible, because they exclude
and destroy one another. Generally,
whenever the assumed principles
of a thing do not conspire into
one essential ratio, the thing will
have no essence, and consequently
no possibility of existence. Hence
everything is intrinsically impossible
which lacks some constituent,
or of which the constituents cannot
meet together.
</p>

<p>
Things intrinsically impossible
are no beings, not even ideal beings;
for since they have no essence,
they have no objective intelligibility.
Nevertheless, they are
said to be <hi rend='italic'>really</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>truly</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>entitatively</hi>
impossible, inasmuch as they are
the opposite of possible entity, reality,
and truth.
</p>

<pb n='293'/><anchor id='Pg293'/>

<p>
Besides this intrinsic and absolute
impossibility, there is a relative
impossibility, which is styled <hi rend='italic'>extrinsic</hi>,
arising from a deficiency or
limitation of extrinsic power. It is
evident that a thing intrinsically
possible may be extrinsically impossible
to causes possessing limited
power. To God nothing is impossible.
When we say that God
cannot sin or make a square circle,
we do not limit his power, but only
point out the <hi rend='italic'>intrinsic</hi> impossibility
of the thing. And let this suffice
with regard to possibles and impossibles.
</p>

<index index='pdf'/>
<head>Principles of real relation.</head>

<p>
Relative
we call <q>that which connotes
something else</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>id quod se habet ad
aliud</foreign>. Thus the greater connotes
the less, as nothing can be styled
<q>greater</q> except as compared with
something less; and, similarly, the
less connotes the greater, as nothing
can be styled <q>less</q> except as
compared with something greater.
Hence greater and less are both
relative.
</p>

<p>
That one thing may connote another,
there must be some link between
them&mdash;that is, a communication
in something that reaches them
both, and thus connects the one
with the other. Hence, to constitute
a relative being, three things
are required: 1st, that which is to
be related, or the <hi rend='italic'>subject</hi> of the relation;
2d, that to which it is to be
related, or the <hi rend='italic'>term</hi> of the relation;
3d, that through which it is related,
or the <hi rend='italic'>foundation</hi> or <hi rend='italic'>formal reason</hi>
of the relation.
</p>

<p>
It is worth noticing that the word
<q>relation</q> is used by philosophers
in two different senses. Sometimes
it is used as meaning simply <q>the
respect of a subject to a term</q>; as
when we say that the father by his
paternity is related to his son, or
that the son by his filiation is related
to his father. Here paternity
and filiation are simple <hi rend='italic'>relativities</hi>,
which may be called <q>transitive relations,</q>
as the one leads to the
other. But sometimes the word
<q>relation</q> is used as meaning <q>the
tie resulting between two terms from
the conspiration of their distinct
relativities</q>; as when we say that
between the father and his son there
is a tie of consanguinity. Relation
in this sense is nothing else than
the actuality of two correlatives, inasmuch
as connected by their distinct
relativities, and may be styled
<q>resultant relation,</q> or <q>intransitive
relation,</q> as it does not lead
from the subject to the term, but is
predicated of both together.
</p>

<p>
The precise distinction between
relativity and resultant relation is
marked out by the two prepositions
<hi rend='italic'>to</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>between</hi>. Relativity relates
the subject <hi rend='italic'>to</hi> its term; resultant
relation, or correlation, intervenes
<hi rend='italic'>between</hi> two terms. Relativity
needs completion in a term having
an opposite relativity, as it is evident
that paternity has no completion
without a son; and thus one
relativity essentially needs to be
completed by the other; but correlation
is perfectly complete, as it is
the result of the completion of one
relativity by the other. And, lastly,
the formal reason or foundation of
the simple relativity is that which
induces the connotation, or the respect
of one term to another; whilst
the formal reason of the correlation
is the conspiration of two relativities.
Thus the foundation of paternity
and of filiation is <hi rend='italic'>generation</hi>,
active on the part of the father, and
passive on the part of the son; but
the formal reason of consanguinity
is not the generation, but the conspiration
of paternity and filiation
into a relative unity. This shows
that these two kinds of relation are
<pb n='294'/><anchor id='Pg294'/>
entirely distinct, though they are
essentially connected with one another
in the constitution of the relative
being.
</p>

<p>
Let us now inquire in what the
<hi rend='italic'>reality</hi> of relations consists. Here
again we have to make a distinction;
for among the relations which are
called <hi rend='italic'>real</hi>, some are real in fact, as
the transcendental relations, and
others are real by denomination
only, as all the predicamental relations.
</p>

<p>
Transcendental relation is that
which intervenes between the act
and the term, or the formal and the
material principles of one and the
same being. Such a relation is
called <q>transcendental,</q> because
it transcends the limits of any particular
predicament, and, like <hi rend='italic'>being</hi>,
extends to all predicaments. This
relation is truly real, whether we
take <q>relation</q> as a simple relativity
or as a resultant correlation.
For the relativity of an act to its
term is nothing less than the <hi rend='italic'>actuality</hi>
of the act in the same term; in
like manner, the relativity of a term
to its act is nothing less than the
<hi rend='italic'>actuality</hi> of the term in the same act.
We know, in fact, that the common
foundation of the two relativities is
<hi rend='italic'>actuation</hi>, active on the part of the
act, and passive on the part of the
term; and from actuation nothing
but actuality can result. And since
by such an actuation the act and
the term are <hi rend='italic'>really</hi> constituted in
one another, hence their relativities
need nothing extrinsic for their
completion, but the one intrinsically
completes the other in the same individual
being, and both conspire
into one absolute actuality, which
is the formal complement of the
same being, as we have shown in
another place.
</p>

<p>
But with predicamental relations
the case is different. The subject
and the term of the predicamental
relation do not communicate with
one another through themselves
immediately, but through something
else, and are always physically
distinct, as we shall see hereafter;
whence it follows that the
predicamental relativity always refers
the subject to a term extrinsic
to it, and thus needs something extrinsic
for its entitative completion.
But nothing which is extrinsic to
the subject can complete anything
intrinsic to it so as to form a real
entity. Therefore the relativity of
the subject to its term is not a real
entity of the subject, but only a real
denomination. The minor of this
syllogism can be easily proved; for
two things which are, and remain,
extrinsic to one another cannot
conspire into <emph>one</emph> real unity; but
the subject and the term of predicamental
relations are, and remain,
extrinsic to one another; they cannot,
therefore, conspire into one real
unity. Hence they cannot give
rise to any new real entity; for
<hi rend='italic'>unity</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>entity</hi> are convertible
terms.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, predicamental relations
arise between two absolute
terms without anything new being
introduced into them. For if we
have two real terms, <hi rend='italic'>A</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>B</hi>, possessing
something which is common
to both, their communication in
this common thing will make them
relative. Yet such a communication
leaves <hi rend='italic'>A</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>B</hi> in possession
of that reality which is said to be
common, and adds no real entity to
them. If <hi rend='italic'>A</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>B</hi> are both white,
the whiteness which is in <hi rend='italic'>A</hi> is by
no means modified by the existence
of whiteness in <hi rend='italic'>B</hi>. The fact that
<hi rend='italic'>A</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>B</hi> are both white, simply
means that whiteness is not confined
to <hi rend='italic'>A</hi>; but it does not imply
any new real entity in <hi rend='italic'>A</hi>, and
<pb n='295'/><anchor id='Pg295'/>
therefore <hi rend='italic'>A</hi> remains identically the
same, whether there is another
white body, <hi rend='italic'>B</hi>, or not; and if there
were one thousand white bodies, <hi rend='italic'>A</hi>
would become related to them all,
and acquire a thousand relativities,
without the least real modification
of its entity.
</p>

<p>
Not even the relation between
agent and patient, which is the
nearest possible imitation of the
transcendental relation between the
essential constituents of absolute
being, is a new entity. A being
which acts is an <hi rend='italic'>agent</hi>; and a being
which is acted on is a <hi rend='italic'>patient</hi>.
Agent and patient are connected
by predicamental relation, the <hi rend='italic'>act</hi>
produced by the first, and received
in the second, being the foundation
of their relativities. Now, is the
relativity of the agent to the patient
a new real entity above and
besides the substance of the agent
and its action? By no means.
For such a relativity arises from
this only: that the act produced by
the agent <hi rend='italic'>is received in the patient</hi>;
and as the patient is a being distinct
from the agent, the <hi rend='italic'>reception</hi>
of the act in the patient cannot
concur to the constitution of any
new reality in the agent. Hence
the whole reality of the agent, as
such, consists in its substance and
its action; while the reception of
its action elsewhere can add no
real entity to it, but simply gives it
a real denomination desumed from
the reality of the effect produced.
For the same reason, the relativity
of the patient to the agent is no
new real entity above and besides
the substance of the patient and its
passion. This relativity, in fact,
arises from this only: that the act
received in the patient <hi rend='italic'>comes from
the agent</hi>; and as the agent is a
being distinct from the patient, the
<hi rend='italic'>coming</hi> of the act from the agent
cannot concur to the constitution
of any new reality in the patient.
Hence the whole reality of the patient,
as such, consists in its substance
and its passion, or reception
of the act; while the coming of this
act from a distinct being can add
no real entity to it, but simply gives
it a real denomination desumed
from the reality of the causation.
</p>

<p>
From what precedes we may
conclude that the reality of predicamental
relations requires no new
real entity superadded to the real
terms and the real foundation of
their relativity, and accordingly
predicamental relations are only
nominal realities.
</p>

<p>
Relations are either <hi rend='italic'>virtual</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>formal</hi>,
or <hi rend='italic'>habitual</hi>. Virtual relativity
is predicated of a subject which contains
in itself virtually (<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>in actu primo</foreign>)
something through which it can
communicate with a distinct term.
Thus everything visible has a virtual
relativity to the eye before it
is seen; because all that is visible
has the power to make an impression
upon the eye. Hence <hi rend='italic'>visibility</hi>
is a virtual relativity, or, if
we may so call it, a mere referability.
In Latin, it is called <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ordo</foreign>&mdash;<q>ordination</q>;
and in the language
of the schools, the visible
would be said to have <q>a special
ordination to the eye</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>visibile ordinem
habet ad oculum</foreign>. In the same
manner, the eye has a special ordination
to the visible, the intellect
to the intelligible, etc.
</p>

<p>
The formal relativity is predicated
of a subject which is formally
(<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>in actu secundo</foreign>) connected with its
correlative by the formal participation
of a common entity. Thus,
when the visible object strikes the
eye, the action of the one upon the
other entails a formal link of relativity
between the two, and it is
thus that the previous virtual relativity
<pb n='296'/><anchor id='Pg296'/>
of the one to the other becomes
formal. This formal relativity in
Latin is often called <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>respectus</foreign>&mdash;<q>a
respect</q>; and the things thus related
are said <q>to regard</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>respicere</foreign>&mdash;one
another.
</p>

<p>
The habitual relativity is predicated
of that which has been
brought into relation with its correlative
by something in which both
originally communicated, but which,
owing to the destruction of one of
the two, has ceased to be common.
This relativity in Latin is properly
called <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>habitudo</foreign>&mdash;that is, <q>habitual
connotation</q>; and the subject
thus related is spoken of as <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>habens
se ad aliquid</foreign>&mdash;a phrase which we
do not attempt to translate, and
which is used by philosophers in a
more general sense to express all
kinds of relations.<note place='foot'>The general definition of relation is, <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Id.
cuius totum esse est ad aliud se habere</foreign>.</note> Thus a murderer
is still habitually related to
the man whom he has killed, although
the man killed is no more a
man; and, in the same manner, a
son is habitually related to his father,
even after his father's death;
for he is still the same son of the
same father, and it would be absurd
to pretend that he has lost his
own relativity and ceased to be a
real son only because his father is
no more. It must be remarked,
however, that this habitual relativity
cannot be real, except when the
relation has an intrinsic foundation.
For when the foundation is extrinsic,
there is nothing formally remaining
in the subject which, after
the suppression of the term, can
keep up its relativity. Thus, if the
moon were annihilated, the distance
from the earth to the moon
would totally vanish, as every one
will easily admit.
</p>

<p>
Much might be said about predicamental
relations, both intrinsic
and extrinsic; but, in a general
treatise like this, we cannot well
enter into matters of detail. We
will only state that relations are
divided according to their foundations.
Intrinsic relations are respectively
founded on substance,
on action and passion, on quality,
and on quantity; and therefore
may be reduced to four kinds.
Extrinsic relations also may be divided
into four kinds, as they are
respectively founded on a common
cause, on a common region of ubication,
on a common duration, or
on a common extrinsic term of
comparison.
</p>

<p>
Substance, and everything else
considered absolutely, founds the
relations of <hi rend='italic'>unity</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>plurality</hi>.
Action and passion found the relations
of <hi rend='italic'>causality</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>dependence</hi>.
Quality founds the relations of <hi rend='italic'>likeness</hi>
or <hi rend='italic'>unlikeness</hi>. Quantity founds
the relations of <hi rend='italic'>equality</hi> or <hi rend='italic'>inequality</hi>.
All these relations are called <hi rend='italic'>intrinsic</hi>,
because their foundation is
something intrinsic to the terms related.
</p>

<p>
A common cause founds the relation
which we may call of <hi rend='italic'>collateralness</hi>
between two terms proceeding
from it. Thus two brothers
are connected in mutual fraternity,
inasmuch as they are the offspring
of the same parents. A
common region of ubication and
movement founds the relation of
<hi rend='italic'>distance</hi>. A common duration
founds the relation of <hi rend='italic'>succession</hi>.
A common extrinsic term of comparison
founds the relation of <hi rend='italic'>site</hi>
or <hi rend='italic'>situation</hi>. All these relations are
called <hi rend='italic'>extrinsic</hi>, because their foundation
is extrinsic to the terms related.

<head>Principles of real distinction.</head>

<p>
Distinction
is nothing but a negation
of identity; and therefore
there must be as many kinds of
<pb n='297'/><anchor id='Pg297'/>
distinction as there are kinds of
identity which can be denied.
Hence we cannot properly determine
the principles of real distinction
without first ascertaining what
are the principles of real identity.
</p>

<p>
Identity is a <hi rend='italic'>relative unity</hi>, or a
relation founded on the <hi rend='italic'>unity</hi> of a
thing. For the thing which is to
be styled <hi rend='italic'>the same</hi> must be compared
with itself according to that
entity on account of which it is to
be pronounced to be identical with
itself; and it is evident that such
an entity must be <hi rend='italic'>one</hi> in order to
be <hi rend='italic'>the same</hi>. Thus if I say: <q>The
pen with which I am now writing
is the very same which I used yesterday,</q>
the pen with which I am
now writing will be the subject of
the relation, the pen which I used
yesterday will be the term of the
relation, and the oneness of its entity
will be the foundation of the
relation and the formal reason of
the identity.
</p>

<p>
As relations, like everything else,
are specified by their formal reasons,
it is clear that there must be
as many kinds of identity as there
are kinds of unities on which the
relation of identity can be founded.
Now, three kinds of unities can be
conceived: first, the formal unity
of a complete being, or a complete
unity, which may be called <hi rend='italic'>physical</hi>
unity; secondly, the unity of an
incomplete or metaphysical reality,
which may be called <hi rend='italic'>metaphysical</hi>
unity; thirdly, the unity of a being
of reason, which may be called
<hi rend='italic'>logical</hi> unity. Accordingly, there
can be three kinds of identity, viz.,
the physical, the metaphysical, and
the logical. Let us say a word
about each.
</p>

<p>
Physical identity is a relation
founded on the unity of a physical entity,
and is the most real of all identities.
Some philosophers taught
that this identity is merely a logical
relation, or a relation of reason,
because a relation cannot be real
unless its subject be really distinct
from its term&mdash;a condition which
cannot be verified when the subject
and the term are identical. But
they did not reflect that a thing
must be called <hi rend='italic'>really</hi> identical with
itself then only when it cannot be
<hi rend='italic'>really</hi> distinguished from itself, and
<hi rend='italic'>inasmuch as</hi> it excludes real distinction
from itself. It is therefore
manifest that real identity excludes
real distinction in that in which
there is identity. Nevertheless, the
thing which is substantially identical
with itself may still really differ
from itself in the manner of its being,
and may, as the subject of the
relativity, involve a real entity,
which it does not involve as the
term of the same relativity; and
accordingly the substantial identity
of a thing with itself does not exclude
<emph>all</emph> real distinction. The pen
with which I am now writing, although
identical with the pen that
lay on the table one hour before, is
now in different accidental conditions,
and has some real mode,
which was wanting one hour ago.
And this shows that there can be a
sufficient real distinction between
the subject and the term of the
relation, even though they are substantially
identical.
</p>

<p>
Physical identity may be divided
into <hi rend='italic'>complete</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>incomplete</hi>. It is
complete, or total, when a being is
compared with itself through the
unity of its physical entity, as in
the preceding example of the pen.
It is incomplete, or partial, when a
physical part is compared with a
physical whole, or, <foreign rend='italic'>vice versa</foreign>, as
when we compare the whole man
with his soul or with his body.
</p>

<p>
Metaphysical identity is a relation
founded on the unity of a
<pb n='298'/><anchor id='Pg298'/>
metaphysical entity, and possesses
a metaphysical reality. It may be
divided into <hi rend='italic'>adequate</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>inadequate</hi>.
It is adequate when a being
is compared with itself through
the unity of some metaphysical
reality which belongs to it. Such
is the <hi rend='italic'>personal</hi> identity of John
when old with John when young;
for although he has undergone
many physical changes in his body,
and therefore has not preserved a
perfect physical identity with himself,
still his formal personality,
which is wholly due to his soul, has
not changed at all. The identity
will be inadequate when any metaphysical
constituent of a complete
being is compared with the being
itself, or <foreign rend='italic'>vice versa</foreign>. Such is the
identity of the substantial act with
the substance of which it is the act,
of the matter with the material being,
and of any property or attribute
with the thing of which it is the
property or the attribute. Such is
also the identity of the divine
Personalities with the divine essence;
for, although the divine
Paternity identifies itself perfectly
with the divine essence, this latter
requires further identification with
the divine Filiation and with the
passive Spiration; for it must be as
whole and perfect in the Second
and the Third Person as it is in the
First.
</p>

<p>
Logical identity, or identity of
reason, is a relation founded on the
unity of a being of reason. It may
be divided into <hi rend='italic'>objective</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>subjective</hi>.
The objective has its foundation
in the real order of things;
the subjective has no foundation
except in our conception. Thus
the identity we conceive between a
horse and its owner as to their
animality is an identity of reason
only, although it is grounded on a
real foundation; for animality is
indeed to be found really in both,
but its unity is only a unit of reason;
for animality, as common to both,
is only a logical entity, which we
call <q>genus.</q> The same is to be
said of the identity between Peter
and Paul as to their humanity; for
humanity, though real in both, is
not numerically, but only specifically,
one, and its unity is therefore a
unity of reason; for <q>species</q> is a
logical being. On the contrary,
when we say that <q>a stone is
heavy,</q> the identity between a
<hi rend='italic'>stone</hi> and the <hi rend='italic'>subject</hi> of such a
proposition has no foundation except
in our reason, and therefore is
purely subjective; and the same is
to be said of the identity of the
verb <hi rend='italic'>is</hi> with the <hi rend='italic'>copula</hi> of the proposition,
of <hi rend='italic'>heavy</hi> with the <hi rend='italic'>predicate</hi>,
etc. It is evident, in fact, that the
ground on which these last relations
are founded is not a real unity, and
not even a unity having anything
corresponding to it in the real
order; since subject, predicate, etc.,
are mere conceptions and creations
of our mind.
</p>

<p>
We have thus three kinds of
identity: the physical, which is
either complete or incomplete; the
metaphysical, which is either adequate
or inadequate; the logical,
which is either objective or merely
subjective. Since distinction is
the negation of identity, it is obvious
that the distinction between
two terms always results from the
non-unity of the same, and is conceived
by the comparison of the one
with the other according to something
which can be affirmed of the
one, and must be denied of the
other. Those things, in fact, are
said to be distinct of which the one
is not the other, or in one of which
there is something not to be found
in the other.
</p>

<p>
First, then, to deny real physical
<pb n='299'/><anchor id='Pg299'/>
identity is to assert real <hi rend='italic'>physical</hi>
distinction. Physical distinction
may be either <hi rend='italic'>complete</hi> or <hi rend='italic'>incomplete</hi>
as well as physical identity. It
will be complete, or major, when,
comparing two complete wholes
with one another, we deny that the
one is the other; as when we deny
that the sun is the moon. It will
be incomplete, or minor, when,
comparing together the whole and
any of its parts, we deny that the
whole is any of its parts, and <foreign rend='italic'>vice
versa</foreign>; as when we deny that
Germany is Europe, or that the
roof is the house. It is evident
that incomplete physical distinction
always coexists with incomplete
physical identity.
</p>

<p>
The true and certain sign of real
physical distinction between two
things is their separability or their
state of actual separation. For
when two things are completely
distinct as to their physical entity,
they are each in possession of their
own distinct existence; and consequently
the existence of the one
does not depend on the existence
of the other. On the other hand,
although a physical whole cannot
exist as a whole, if its parts be
separated, yet each of its physical
parts can exist separated, as each
of them has its own existence independent
of the existence of the
whole.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, to deny real metaphysical
identity is to assert real <hi rend='italic'>metaphysical</hi>
distinction. Metaphysical
distinction may be either <hi rend='italic'>adequate</hi>
or <hi rend='italic'>inadequate</hi> no less than metaphysical
identity. It will be adequate,
or major, when, comparing
together two metaphysical constituents,
we deny that the one is
the other; as when we deny that
the act is the potency. It will be
inadequate, or minor, when, comparing
a metaphysical compound
with any of its constituents, we deny
that the constituent is the compound,
and <foreign rend='italic'>vice versa</foreign>; as when
we deny that existence is the thing
existing, or that person is personality.
The inadequate metaphysical
distinction always coexists with
an inadequate metaphysical identity.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, to deny an identity of
reason is to assert a distinction <hi rend='italic'>of
reason</hi>. A distinction of reason
may be either <hi rend='italic'>objective</hi> or merely
<hi rend='italic'>subjective</hi>, no less than the identity
of reason. It will be objective, or
major, when, comparing together
two entities which are really identical,
we find in their identical reality
a ground for denying their conceptual
identity; as when we deny
that God's eternity is God's immensity,
or when we deny that in any
given being one essential attribute,
as animality, is another, as rationality.
This distinction is objective,
because its ground is found in the
object itself; and yet it is not real,
because each term represents the
same thing under two distinct aspects.
Thus, in man, animality
really includes a rational soul, and
therefore implies rationality. But
the distinction will be purely subjective,
or minor, when, comparing
together two entities, we find no
ground whatever for denying their
identity, except in our subjective
manner of viewing them. Thus,
although <hi rend='italic'>man</hi> is identical with
<hi rend='italic'>rational animal</hi>, we can distinguish
man from rational animal as a subject
from a predicate; and it is
evident that this distinction has no
ground but in our conception.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, we have three kinds
of distinction: the real physical,
which is either complete or incomplete;
the real metaphysical, which
is either adequate or inadequate;
the logical, or of reason, which is
<pb n='300'/><anchor id='Pg300'/>
either objective or merely subjective.
This division is exhaustive.
Some will say that we have forgotten
the <hi rend='italic'>modal</hi> distinction. But
the fact is that we have abstained
on purpose from mentioning it in
connection with any special kind
of distinction, because it may fall
under the physical as well as the
metaphysical distinction, according
as it happens to be understood; for
it is differently understood by different
writers.
</p>

<p>
Some authors consider that there
is a modal distinction between the
spherical wax and its sphericity, between
the soul affected by fear and
its affection, between the finger inflected
and its inflection, and
generally <hi rend='italic'>between the modified subject
and its mode</hi>. Others, as
Suarez, seem to admit a modal distinction
between the wax simply
and its sphericity, between the soul
simply and its affection, between
the finger simply and its inflection,
and generally <hi rend='italic'>between the subject
simply and its mode</hi>. And others,
again, admit a modal distinction between
the wax having a spherical
form and the same wax having a
different form; between the soul
affected by a movement of fear and
the same soul affected by a different
movement; between the finger inflected
and the same finger not
inflected; and generally <hi rend='italic'>between a
subject having one mode, and the same
subject having another mode</hi>.<note place='foot'>There are philosophers who do not admit any
real distinction between a thing and its mode.
Thus Tongiorgi (<hi rend='italic'>Ontol.</hi>, n. 148) says that <q>the
mode of any being is really nothing else than
the being itself considered in a different manner.</q>
This view deserves no discussion, as it is evidently
false. If the mode of a thing were the
thing itself, then the sphericity of the wax would
be the wax, the joy of the soul would be the soul,
and every affection would be the subject of the
affection. The author seems to have confounded
<hi rend='italic'>being</hi>, the participle, with <hi rend='italic'>being</hi>, the substantive.</note>
</p>

<p>
These different opinions have
been occasioned by an imperfect
analysis of distinction. Those who
originally treated of this matter
called <hi rend='italic'>real</hi> all distinction which
was not a mere distinction of reason,
and overlooked the necessity
of subdividing real distinctions into
physical and metaphysical. Hence
the modal distinction was simply
called <hi rend='italic'>real</hi>, without further examining
whether it had a physical or a
metaphysical character; the more
so as it was assumed that real modes
were physical entities&mdash;which would
convey the idea that real modal
distinction is of a physical nature.
But the assumption is not to be
admitted, because, as we have remarked
in another article, modes
cannot be styled <q>physical</q> entities,
as they have no possibility of
separate existence. This being
premised, let us briefly examine
the three aforesaid opinions.
</p>

<p>
The first admits a modal distinction
between spherical wax and its
sphericity. Sphericity cannot exist
without a subject; and therefore
it must be ranked among metaphysical
entities. On the other
hand, spherical wax is a metaphysical
compound of wax and sphericity.
Hence, from what we have
said above, the distinction of the
one from the other is an <hi rend='italic'>inadequate
metaphysical</hi> distinction.
</p>

<p>
The second opinion admits a
modal distinction between the wax
simply and its sphericity. Sphericity,
as we have stated, is a metaphysical
entity, and so is <q>wax simply</q>
also; for wax, as such, is
not yet spherical, although, as a
subject of sphericity, it excludes
every other form. Such a wax
therefore has no form, and, as such,
it cannot exist; and accordingly
it is an incomplete being. Hence
the distinction between the wax
simply and its sphericity is that
which intervenes between two principles
<pb n='301'/><anchor id='Pg301'/>
of a complete being, and
therefore is an <hi rend='italic'>adequate metaphysical</hi>
distinction.
</p>

<p>
The third opinion alone gives
the true notion of the <hi rend='italic'>modal</hi> distinction.
For if a piece of wax
which is spherical happens to acquire
another form, say the cubical,
the comparison of the cubical
with the spherical wax will involve
two terms physically real; and as
the substance of the wax is still the
same, no distinction will be found
between the two terms, except that
which arises from denying the identity
of the cubical with the spherical
form. We have thus a real and
physical modal distinction: <hi rend='italic'>real</hi>
and <hi rend='italic'>physical</hi>, because the spherical
wax really and physically differs
from the cubic wax; <hi rend='italic'>modal</hi>, because
the negation of identity falls
on the two modes, and not on the
substance.
</p>

<p>
From this we learn that neither
the first nor the second opinion
above mentioned gives the true notion
of modal distinction. The
first denies only the identity of the
spherical wax with its sphericity;
the second denies only the identity
of wax simply with sphericity.
Now, it is evident that neither
spherical wax nor wax simply is a
mode. It is evident, therefore, that
neither opinion denies modal identity.
But modal distinction cannot
be anything else than a denial
of modal identity. Therefore neither
opinion gives the true notion of
modal distinction.
</p>

<p>
As modes are accidental formalities,
the modal distinction may
also be called <hi rend='italic'>formal</hi>. The Scotist
philosophers imagined a formal
distinction of another kind, which,
according to them, was to be admitted
between the attributes of
real being, and which was neither
real nor a mere distinction of reason,
but something intermediate.
They called it <q>formal distinction
arising from the nature of the
thing</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>distinctio formalis ex natura
rei</foreign>. We need not refute this
invention. We have already given
in full the general theory of distinction,
and we have found no
room for any formal distinction intermediary
between real distinctions
and distinctions of reason;
and, as to the attributes of real beings,
we have shown, in the article
before this, that they are not really
distinct from one another, but admit
of a simple distinction of reason,
which, however, has a real
foundation in the thing.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes distinction is styled
<hi rend='italic'>formal</hi> as contrasted with <hi rend='italic'>virtual</hi>.
Thus we may say that there is a
formal distinction between two
terms formally existing&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>, two
existing men, and a virtual distinction
between two virtual terms&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>,
two possible men. And generally,
whenever one and the same
thing virtually contains two or
more, these latter, as thus contained,
are said to be <hi rend='italic'>virtually</hi> distinct.
Thus intellect and reason
are only virtually distinct, as they
are one concrete power of acquiring
knowledge which can perform
its task by two different processes.
This virtual distinction is, of
course, nothing but a distinction
of reason.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, again, distinction is
called <hi rend='italic'>positive</hi> as contrasted with
<hi rend='italic'>negative</hi>. It is positive when the
two terms of which we deny the
identity are both positive, and it
is negative when one of the two
terms is negative; as when we distinguish
the existent from the non-existent.
Negative distinction is a
<hi rend='italic'>real</hi> distinction; for the negation
of <hi rend='italic'>real</hi> identity can be predicated
not only of two real beings, but
<pb n='302'/><anchor id='Pg302'/>
also, and with greater reason, of the
existent as compared with the non-existent.
</p>

<p>
It may be remarked that <hi rend='italic'>distinction</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>difference</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>diversity</hi> are
not synonymous. Diversity is
most properly predicated of two
things that are not of the same genus;
difference of two things that
are not of the same species, and
distinction of two things that are
not numerically identical. Nevertheless,
the terms <hi rend='italic'>distinct</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>different</hi>,
and <hi rend='italic'>diverse</hi> are very frequently employed
for one another, even by
good authors.
</p>

<p>
We observe, lastly, that distinction,
as such, is not a relation; for
all relation presupposes some distinction
between the terms related,
as a condition of its possibility.
Yet two positive terms really distinct
have always a certain <hi rend='italic'>relative</hi>
opposition, inasmuch as there is
always something common to both
(at least their being) which may be
taken as a foundation of mutual
relativity.
</p>

<p>
And here we close our investigation
about nominal realities. We
have shown that possibles, relations,
and distinctions are no <hi rend='italic'>special</hi>
realities, but are called <hi rend='italic'>real</hi> from
the reality of other things. Real
possibility is only the possibility
of a real being; real relation is
only the actuality of two terms
really communicating in something
identical; and real distinction is
only the existence of things of
which the one is not really the
other.
</p>

<p>
As this is our last article on the
principles of real being, we beg to
remind the reader that our object
in this treatise has been only to
point out distinctly, and to express
with as great a philosophical precision
as our language could permit,
all that concerns the constitution
of being in general. We may
have failed to employ always the
best phraseology, but we hope our
analysis of real being is philosophically
correct, and the principles
we have laid down under the guidance
of the ancients will be found
to shed a pure and abundant light
on all the questions of special
metaphysics. But the student of
philosophy should not forget that
the greatest difficulty in the settlement
of all such questions arises,
not so much from the nature of
the subjects investigated, as from
the imperfect knowledge and mis-application
of philosophical language.
And this is the reason why
we did our best to determine the
exact purport of the terms most
frequently employed in metaphysical
treatises.

<p>
During these terrible events, I
dare say the combatants were not
the most to be pitied. They, at
least, were in action, in the midst
of powder and noise; and if they
fell, wounded or dead, they scarcely
had time to know it. But think
of the poor friends and relatives
who remained without news, and
almost without strength to seek
any information! They were to be
pitied.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps you may live in a city,
which does not prevent you from
sometimes going to the country;
and so you can understand how
certain villages are isolated from
all daily communication. Our hamlet
of Ordonniers, although near
the large city of Issoudun, was, in
this respect, worse off than many
other places; for when M. le Marquis
was absent from the château,
there was no daily paper, none of
the villagers being liberal enough
to indulge in that luxury. The
Perdreaux, in their time, subscribed
for a paper, which came every
other day, and gave the market
prices and a jumble of news of
people and things here and there
about a month old. Even this resource
no longer existed. M. le
Curé was the only one who cared
for what was going on; but as his
means were very limited, he contented
himself with a little paper
which only came every Sunday.
</p>

<p>
Judge, then, of the terrible anguish
at Muiceron; above all, when
they saw all the able-bodied men
of the commune leave; for you remember
that then, for the first
time, the provinces showed their
teeth at the news of the horrors
in Paris, and rose <foreign rend='italic'>en masse</foreign> to go
and punish the rebellious children
of a city that, in her selfishness,
disturbed the whole of France
without any just right.
</p>

<p>
The women displayed great bravery.
They fitted out their sons,
husbands, brothers, and betrothed,
and let them leave for the dreadful
struggle without wincing. But the
next day&mdash;but the following days!
What anxiety and what tears!
</p>

<p>
It was touching to see them each
morning run before the country
stage or speak to the letter-carrier,
in hopes of hearing some words
to reassure them. Generally, the
stage drove rapidly on at a gallop;
for stage-drivers are not patient,
and the poor creatures' only information
was an oath or rough
word. As for the letter-carrier, he
knew nothing positive, and was
content to give the flying reports,
which were not enough to quiet
those troubled souls.
</p>

<p>
Jeanne and her mother kept at
home. They prayed to God and
wept, poor things! It was the
best way to learn patience; but
their hearts sank within them. It
was a hard blow to have been so
near happiness, and then suddenly
to see it fly, perhaps for ever.
</p>

<pb n='309'/><anchor id='Pg309'/>

<p>
Old Ragaud was miserable that
he could not go off with the other
men of the neighborhood. He was
too old, and this only increased his
vexation, as he was but three or
four years older than Michou, and
he was in the battle! The sadness
and ill-humor of the poor old fellow
rendered Muiceron still gloomier,
and the women neither dared stir
nor sigh before him.
</p>

<p>
The little they knew was very
terrible; and when the private
letters began to arrive, all the
families were plunged in despair
and sorrow. Our commune alone
lost three men; among them Cotentin,
the miller, an honest peasant,
and father of four children. He
was shot dead, almost at the
moment of his arrival; and the next
day came the news of the death of
Sylvain Astiaud, son of the head-forester,
one of our bravest boys.
Each one trembled for his own at
the announcement of these misfortunes,
and at last silence was
considered a sure sign that mourning
should be prepared.
</p>

<p>
Jeanne felt all her courage fail.
She could no longer either eat or
sleep, and even feared to question
the passers-by. Certainly the good
God, who wished to sanctify the
poor child, and make her a perfect
woman, did not spare her any suffering.
He acted with her like
a father who is tender and severe
at the same time; who corrects
the faults of his child, knowing
well that they are more hurtful
than death, and then recompenses
her when petting can no longer
spoil her.
</p>

<p>
Therefore this little Jeannette
had to go to the end of her trial
before relief came and her tears
were dried. And this happened
through that giddy, wild Pierre
Luguet, who had left, like the
others, singing and blustering,
assuring the people around that he
did not believe a word of the current
rumors, and that, in one hour
after his arrival in Paris, he would
find out the whole truth, and send
them all the news. But, behold! as
soon as he was in the midst of
smoking and bleeding Paris, he
lost his senses, imagined himself
killed before he had fired a shot,
and wrote in pencil, on a scrap of
blood-stained paper, a letter to his
parents, all sighs and tears. He
bade them farewell, and begged them
to pray for his soul, as he would be
dead before night; for no one could
live in such a terrible conflict. If
he had only spoken for himself, it
might have passed; but he added
that M. le Marquis, Jean-Louis, and
Michou were certainly dead. He
had sought for them everywhere,
asked everybody, and no one
could give him good news. To
crown his stupidity, he added that,
among the great heaps of corpses
that lay yet unburied, he had
recognized Jean-Louis' blouse of
gray linen bound with black; and
therefore they must weep for the
death of that good, brave boy.
</p>

<p>
Poor Mme. Luguet ran straight
to Muiceron to show that foolish
letter. If there had been the least
degree of cool good sense among
them, it would easily have been
seen they were the words of a
brain addled from fear; but in the
mortal anxiety of the poor Ragauds,
they took it all for good coin.
Jeanne fell on her knees, sobbing
aloud, and, losing the little courage
she still possessed, wrung her hands
in despair. Pierrette threw herself
beside her daughter, trying to
comfort her; and Ragaud wept
bitterly, although he had said a
thousand times a man in tears
is not worthy to wear breeches. In
<pb n='310'/><anchor id='Pg310'/>
the evening, the true religion which
filled those poor hearts came to support
them and give them some
strength. They lighted tapers before
the crucifix and around the
Blessed Virgin, and all night this
afflicted family prayed ardently for
the repose of the souls of the supposed
dead&mdash;who were never better.
</p>

<p>
The next day you would have
been shocked to have seen the
ravages grief had made on their
honest faces. Jeannette, wearied
out with weeping and fatigue, slept
in the arms of her mother, paler
than a camomile-flower. Pierrette
restrained her tears, from fear of
awakening the child; but her hollow
eyes and cheeks were pitiful to
see; and the sun shone brightly in
the room, without any one taking
the trouble to close the shutters.
</p>

<p>
It was in this state that M. le
Curé found the Ragaud family.
His entrance at Muiceron renewed
the lamentations; but Jeannette
was calm, which greatly pleased the
good pastor, as he saw that his
lessons, joined to those of divine
Providence, had borne their fruit.
</p>

<p>
He took the little thing aside,
and, much affected by her deathlike
appearance, spoke gently to her,
and asked her to walk with him on
the bank of La Range.
</p>

<p>
<q>My daughter,</q> said he, <q>it is
not right to sink into such utter
despair about news which is yet
uncertain. Show a little more courage,
for a while at least, until we
hear something positive.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is dead,</q> said Jeannette.
<q>May the will of God be done!
Alas! I should have been too
happy, if I had seen him again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are you so certain? As
for me, I confess Pierre's letter
would not make me lose all hope.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They were three together,</q> said
she. <q>Pierre has written; could
they not have written also?</q>
</p>

<p>
This argument was not bad. The
<foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign> could not reply; for, without
acknowledging it, he did think the
silence very strange. He made the
poor child sit down by the side of
the swift-running stream that glittered
in the bright sunshine, and
spoke to her for a long time in
such soothing, touching words,
Jeanne listened with profound respect
and piety. He spoke of the
happiness of this world, which is
but for a short time; of the necessity
of living and regaining her
strength, that she might console
her parents; of the beautiful day of
eternity; of the heavenly home,
where we will meet again the loved
ones gone before us, never again to
be separated.
</p>

<p>
At another time, Jeannette would
not have understood these words,
and perhaps might have even found
them out of place; but now they
fell upon her heart like soft caresses.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh!</q> said she, <q>it is only now
I understand how dearly I loved
him. Father, tell me, can he see
us from above?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You will have it, then, that he
is absolutely dead,</q> said the <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign>,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
Jeannette, in spite of her grief,
smiled in her tears.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is true,</q> she said; <q>perhaps
he is not dead.</q>
</p>

<p>
Hope had re-entered her soul
with the consolations of the holy
priest. They walked down the
road to the farm, and Jeannette
thanked him with much tenderness,
and remarked, as it was near sunset,
he must return home.
</p>

<p>
<q>One moment,</q> said the good
<foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign>; <q>you are a little egotist. I
can't go without saying a word to
father and mother.</q>
</p>

<pb n='311'/><anchor id='Pg311'/>

<p>
<q>Oh! yes,</q> said she, <q>of course
you must; but, dear father, I will
remain here, and say my rosary in
the shade under the trees; the air
will completely restore me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very well, dear child,</q> replied
the <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign>; <q>and may the Blessed
Virgin console you, my daughter!</q>
</p>

<p>
Jeanne retired under the heavy
foliage, and really took her little
rosary out of her pocket. But this
wood recalled many sweet reminiscences.
It was there Jean-Louis
had found her and saved her life
on that stormy night the year before.
She looked for the spot, near
the woodman's cabin, where he
had taken her in his arms with a
father's care; and as the remembrance
of all this past happiness,
which she had then slighted, came
back to her heart, she leant against
a tree, and hid her face in her
hands.
</p>

<p>
Whether they were tears of repentance,
of regret, of love, or of
prayer that fell from her eyes God
only knows; and surely, in his infinite
goodness, he waited for this
moment of supreme anguish, which
could not have endured much longer,
to say to that heart-broken
child, <q>You have suffered enough;
now be happy!</q>
</p>

<p>
For in that same hour Jean-Louis,
wild with joy, leaped from
the imperial of the country stage
on the highroad, and ran, without
stopping to take breath, toward his
beloved Muiceron.
</p>

<p>
He also remembered the stormy
night, and, from a sentiment you
can well understand, wished to see
again the little hut, if only to throw
a passing glance.
</p>

<p>
He reached the spot, and was
soon near the tree where Jeannette
leant motionless. He recognized
her. The beating of his heart almost
suffocated him; for, with a lover's
instinct, he immediately knew, if
she had come to weep in that spot,
it could only be on his account.
</p>

<p>
He advanced until he stood close
behind her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Jeanne!</q> said he, so softly he
scarcely heard his own voice.
</p>

<p>
Jeannette turned, and gave one
scream. Her eyes wandered a
moment, as if she had seen a phantom,
and she fell half-dead into his
arms.
</p>

<p>
<q>Jeanne! dear, dear Jeanne!
don't you know me?</q> said he, pressing
her to his breast. <q>I have
caused you much sorrow, but it is
all over&mdash;oh! it is all over; tell
me, is it not?</q>
</p>

<p>
The poor child could not speak;
her emotion and joy were too great.
But such happiness don't kill; and
gradually she revived, although she
still trembled like a leaf.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Jeannet!</q> she said at
last, <q>they wrote word you were
dead.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And was that the reason you
were weeping here all alone in this
wood, my poor, dear darling?</q> he
tenderly asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> said she, looking down;
<q>I could not be consoled. Why
did you not send us some news?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wished to surprise you,</q> said
he, with simplicity; <q>and now I
see I did wrong.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>One day more, and I would
have been dead also,</q> said she,
leaning on his arm. <q>Cruel boy,
go!</q>
</p>

<p>
She looked so lovely, still pale
with grief, and yet as lively and
coquettish as before, Jeannet was
obliged to clasp her once again in
his arms, and even kissed her, for
which I hope you will pardon him,
as I do.
</p>

<p>
<q>How good God is,</q> said he, <q>to
permit us to meet again in this very
place! This is the second time,
<pb n='312'/><anchor id='Pg312'/>
dear Jeannette, that I have saved
you when in great trouble; and I
hope it is a sure sign that poor
Jean-Louis will be able to comfort
and assist you all the rest of his life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You will never leave us again;
you will promise that?</q> she replied.
<q>When you are away, all sorts
of misfortunes happen. Oh! how
much we have suffered.</q>
</p>

<p>
And as these words suddenly recalled
the sad events of the last six
months, her flirtation, her thoughtless
conduct, and the lamentable
scenes that followed, she blushed,
sighed, and leant her face, down
which the tears were streaming,
against Jean-Louis' shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<q>My own Jeannette,</q> said he,
<q>you must no longer think of all
that sorrow, now that God has
made us so happy again. There is
no misfortune which does not carry
with it a profitable lesson when we
recognize in it the hand of the
Lord; and, for my part, although
I have been nearly dead with grief,
I say that my present happiness
has not been too dearly bought,
and I would consent to pass again
through the same trials, on condition
of possessing a second day
like this.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! no,</q> said Jeanne, <q>I have
had enough. I have not your courage,
and I will pray to God that I
may be spared from such great
trials. Come,</q> added she, taking
Jeannet's arm, <q>we must go and
surprise our parents. And the dear
<foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign> is just now with them! He
told me so&mdash;the good, holy man
told me you were not dead.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But who set such a report
afloat?</q> asked Jeannet. <q>For really
I was not even in danger.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! what a story,</q> cried Jeanne.
<q>You were in the fight; it could
not be otherwise.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly,</q> said Jeannet, <q>I
fought, and did my best; but I
never for an instant imagined the
good God would let me die without
seeing you again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is very well to have such
happy thoughts,</q> said Jeanne joyfully;
<q>if I could have had them, I
would not have been nearly dead
with anxiety, and hopeless from
such great fear. Now I regret my
tears, and would like to take them
back.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You would not be the richer for
it,</q> said he, laughing; <q>but, Jeannette,
don't laugh at me. It was
neither presumption nor carelessness
made me think so. The good
God put the faith in my heart; and
then, didn't I have round my neck
the silver medal you gave me the day
of your first communion? Wasn't
the image of the Blessed Virgin
powerful enough to turn aside the
balls?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What!</q> said Jeannette with
emotion, <q>have you still my medal?
Is it the very same one? Have
you always worn it, in spite ... in
spite of all.... Jeannet, show it to
me; let me kiss it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No,</q> said Jean-Louis, blushing,
<q>not now. I will show it to you
later.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Right away; I won't wait,</q> said
she in the peremptory manner
which so well became her. <q>I like
to be obeyed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But,</q> said Jeannet, much embarrassed,
<q>I can't, because....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Because what?</q> she replied.
<q>Don't think you are going to be
master here! No, no, not more
now than before, when, you remember,
my mother said, <q>Jeannette
is the boy....</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Really,</q> answered Jean-Louis,
<q>you have a good memory. Well,
then, since Jeannette is the boy,
and I am the girl, I must submit to
her wishes.</q>
</p>

<pb n='313'/><anchor id='Pg313'/>

<p>
And as, in spite of all this talk,
he made no attempt to show her
the medal, another idea entered
her head.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are wounded,</q> said she,
<q>and you don't wish me to see it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is not the reason,</q> he replied,
unbuttoning his vest. <q>I
don't wish you to believe any such
thing.</q>
</p>

<p>
On opening his shirt, he showed
the medal on his breast, and then
the curious Jeannette understood
his resistance; for, near the blessed
image of our dear Mother, she recognized
the long tress of blonde
hair which had been cut off during
her illness.
</p>

<p>
<q>It has never left me,</q> said he;
<q>but I dared not let you see it.
Do you forgive me? Your poor
hair! I said to myself, While it rests
upon my heart, it is as though my
little sister were watching over me.
And in the fight, I thought that, as
the medal of the Blessed Virgin
and your precious souvenir were
also exposed to the fire, I could
not be killed; and you see I was
not mistaken.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh!</q> cried Jeannette, with tears
in her eyes, <q>my dear Jeannet, I
do not deserve such love.</q>
</p>

<p>
They reached Muiceron, arm-in-arm.
Oh! how refreshing was the
shaded court-yard and the fragrant
hedges! And then, the dear
house looked so gay in its new
white coat, its green shutters, the
fresh young vines that hung from
the trellis, and its slate roof newly
repaired, all shining in the soft
rays of the sinking sun. The songs
of the bullfinch and robin were
more joyous than the trumpets and
horns on a patronal feast; and it
seemed as though the good God in
heaven were well pleased, so beautiful
was the blue sky, flecked with
golden-edged clouds! Was it really
the house we saw six months ago?
Jeannet, who had long loved it,
scarcely recognized it; he was
mute with admiration, and, although
he had left it in despair, he accused
himself of having neglected
to look at it until now; for surely
his memory did not recall anything
as joyous and beautiful as he now
beheld in his beloved Muiceron.
</p>

<p>
Shall we ask the reason? There
is a great artist who can paint, with
colors of unparalleled brilliancy,
whatever he chooses to place before
our eyes. He is called happiness;
and God wishes him to walk beside
us, both in this world and the
other.
</p>

<p>
The two dear children began to
run as soon as they entered the
court-yard of Muiceron. Jeannette
was the first to spring across
the threshold, and fell speechless
into her mother's arms. Jean-Louis
quickly followed her, and
stood in the door-way, holding out
his hands to his parents. Then
there were cries, and tears, and
confusion of kisses, and questions
without end and without reason.
Their hearts overflowed. The little
one, as they always called the tall,
handsome boy, was covered with
caresses, stifled with embraces
quite overpowering; for country-people
drink in joy by the bucketful
and don't put on gloves when
they wish to show their love. But
you can imagine Jean-Louis did
not complain. M. le Curé alone
kept aside, with clasped hands,
from time to time putting his
handkerchief to his eyes, and
thanking God, while he waited his
turn.
</p>

<p>
Gradually their happiness toned
down a little; but the excitement
was so great, each one showed his joy
in some particular manner. Old
Ragaud whirled around the room,
<pb n='314'/><anchor id='Pg314'/>
took off his cap to smooth his hair,
and replaced it, all the while laughing
as though he did not know precisely
what he was about; and
Pierrette forgot to ask the children
what they wished to eat, which was
a sure sign her head was completely
turned. As for Jeannette, I must
tell you that, like all innocent,
warm-hearted young girls, she
dared act, in presence of her parents
and M. le Curé, as she would
not have done alone with her
brother; she threw her arms around
his neck every half-second, and
clung to him so closely he could
not stir an inch. Jeannet did not
show greater timidity; seeing her
act with such <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>naïveté</foreign>, he neither
frowned nor looked sour, but accepted
willingly what was so sweetly
offered him.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, Marion, whom no
one thought of, and who bellowed
with joy in chorus with the others,
came to her senses sooner than any
of them, and thought of the supper.
Jeannet smelt the butter frying on
the stove, and acknowledged he
was very hungry. This covered Pierrette
with confusion. She felt very
guilty that she had so neglected
her duties, and asked a thousand
pardons; but Jeannet laughed, as
he kissed her, and told her not to
be excited, as he could easily wait
until the next day, being only really
hungry to see and kiss her.
</p>

<p>
Ragaud would not let the dear
<foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign> go home. It was right that
he should wait until the end of the
feast; and as the good pastor, who
always thought of everything, expressed
a fear that old Germaine
might be anxious about him, they
despatched a stable-boy, with the
wagon and quickest mare at Muiceron,
to fetch her.
</p>

<p>
What a fine supper that was!
All these good people recovered
their appetites, and ate and drank
as they had not done for a long
while. I leave you to imagine the
stories that were told of the revolution.
But Jeannet, not wishing to
cloud their present joy, was careful
to relate events as though all had
been a kind of child's play. Jeannette,
however, paused more than
once as she was about to take a
mouthful. She felt that Jean-Louis
stretched a point now and then for
love of her, and she showed her
gratitude by looking tenderly at
him, while she pressed his hand under
the table.
</p>

<p>
At the dessert, they formed plans.
They talked of re-establishing the
old order of things, of living together
again in peace and harmony,
and that there should be no more
separations. Ragaud, especially,
dwelt at length, and very particularly,
upon the happy future in
store for all of them; threw meaning
glances right and left, in which
could be remarked much hidden
meaning and not a little white
wine. Jeannette smiled, blushed,
looked down; and, I fancy, Jean-Louis'
heart beat high with hope
and expectation of what was to follow.
</p>

<p>
The good man ended by being
much affected, though he endeavored
to pass it all off as a joke; for
it was his wish always to appear
deaf to any kind of sentiment.
</p>

<p>
<q>After all,</q> said he, tapping
Jean-Louis on the shoulder, <q>here
is a boy upon whom we cannot
depend. He is here now at this
very moment; but who knows if
to-morrow he will not be out of
sight as quickly as the stars fall
from the sky on an August night?
Isn't it so, M. le Curé?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is just as you say, Ragaud,</q>
replied the <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign>. <q><q>He who has
drunk will drink again,</q> says the
<pb n='315'/><anchor id='Pg315'/>
proverb; and as this little one went
off once without giving warning,
how can we know but he will do it
again?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! what nonsense,</q> said Jeannet.
<q>My dear parents, I will never
leave you again!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hum!</q> replied Ragaud, <q>you
said that a hundred times before,
and then what did we see? One
fine morning, no Jeannet!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We must tie him,</q> said old
Germaine, laughing; <q>when Jeannette
misbehaved in school, I used
to tie her by the arm to an end of
the bench.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I remember it well,</q> said Jeannette;
<q>and more than once I broke
the string.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then we must find some other
means, if that will not do; think
of something, Germaine,</q> replied
Ragaud, winking over at the children.
</p>

<p>
<q>Think yourself, M. Ragaud,</q>
said she. <q>Are you not master
here?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That depends,</q> replied Ragaud.
<q>If I were master, I would say to
Jean-Louis, Marry, my boy; when
you will have a wife and children,
they will keep you in the country
more than all the ropes, even that
of our well. But Jeannet has declared
he will not hear of marriage;
and here is Jeanne, who can't be
relied upon for advice, as she said
the same thing not more than a
month ago, in presence of M. le
Curé; so we can't sing that tune
any longer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But how do you know? Perhaps
by this time they have both
changed their minds,</q> said the <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign>,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let them say so, then,</q> replied
Ragaud, his eyes beaming with paternal
tenderness that was delightful
to see.
</p>

<p>
<q>O father!</q> said Jean-Louis,
rising, <q>if I dared to understand
you, I would be wild with joy!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If you can't understand me,
little one, Jeannette perhaps can
be a little quicker. Speak, Jeanneton!</q>
</p>

<p>
The child instantly understood
his meaning. In a second she
was beside Jeannet, took his hand,
and both knelt down before their
father.
</p>

<p>
<q>My children, ask M. le Curé's
blessing before mine,</q> said Ragaud
solemnly. <q>He is the representative
of the good God, and it is God
who has conducted all.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was a touching scene. The
good <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign> extended his trembling
hands over Jean-Louis and Jeannette,
who bent low before him,
weeping; then Ragaud did the
same with great simplicity, which is
the sign of true piety, and then
Pierrette took each of their dear
heads in her arms, kissed them, and
said:
</p>

<p>
<q>My poor darlings! May God
protect you all the days of your life!
You have wept so much, you deserve
to be happy together.</q>
</p>

<p>
The poor children were overwhelmed
with joy so deep and
tranquil they could neither move
nor speak. They kept close together,
and looked tenderly at each
other with eyes that said much.
M. le Curé left them for awhile to
themselves and their new-found
happiness. He knew enough of the
human heart to understand that
great display of affection, loud
weeping, and noisy parade of words
and actions are often marks of a
very little fire in the soul; while
love which has been proved by
deeds, and which is scarcely seen,
is always very ardent. As he had
never doubted that Jeannet, hitherto
so perfect, would show and feel
sincere affection as a lover, he was
<pb n='316'/><anchor id='Pg316'/>
glad to see he was not mistaken,
and regarded with much pleasure
this young couple, who were so well
matched.
</p>

<p>
However, it was very easy to see
our <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign> had something to say.
Jean-Louis and Jeannette had softly
retreated to the corner near the
sideboard, a little out of sight of
the parents; and we must imagine
that, feeling themselves a little
more at ease thus sheltered from
observation, the faculty of speech
returned to them, as they could be
heard whispering and laughing like
children at recreation. It was so
charming to see them thus relieved
from all their difficulties, and swimming
in the full tide of happiness,
like fish in the river, no one had the
courage to disturb them.
</p>

<p>
But our <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign> had his own idea,
and would not leave until he had
made it known; so, as he saw Jean-Louis
and Jeannette might chatter
away a long while, he rose, as if to
say good-night, which made all the
rest rise; for, although intensely
happy, they did not forget to be
civil.
</p>

<p>
<q>My children,</q> said the pastor,
addressing the old as well as the
young, <q rend='pre'>I will go to sleep to-night
very happy. For forty years, come
next All-Saints, that I have been
your <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign>, never have I assisted at
a betrothal as consoling as yours,
for which I will return thanks to
God all my life. You are going to
marry as is seldom done in the
world nowadays; that is to say,
with hearts even more full of esteem
than of love, which enables me, in
the name of the Lord, to promise
you as much happiness as can fall
to the lot of mortals here below.
You know already that a house
built without foundation cannot
stand, and that the grain sown in
bad soil bears no fruit. It is the
same with the sacrament of marriage,
when it is received by a soul
that is frivolous and vain, and feels
neither regret for the past nor
makes good resolutions for the future.
Oh! how happy I am I cannot
say this about you; and how
my old heart, which has pitied all
your sufferings, now is gladdened
at your happiness, well deserved by
the piety and resignation of the one
and the sincere repentance of the
other&mdash;this is for our betrothed.
Great disinterestedness, and all the
domestic virtues of a Christian
life is the praise I unhesitatingly
bestow upon you, the good parents!
But if this reward is beautiful, if
nothing can exceed it, since it is the
pledge of a whole life of peace and
happiness, know that the Lord will
not be surpassed in generosity, and
that he has prepared a delightful
surprise by my mouth, which will
be like the crowning bouquet on
the summit of an edifice just completed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>My dear Ragaud, I speak now to
you. Twenty years ago, when your
generous heart received, without the
slightest hesitation, a poor, abandoned
child, it was an honorable and
religious act, which deserved the
warmest praise; but to-day, when
you give your only daughter to this
same child, from pure esteem of his
noble qualities, without regard to
the gossip of the people around,
this second action surpasses the
first in excellence, and deserves a
special recompense from our good
God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Well! you will soon have it.
Jean-Louis, my child, as it is generally
said, there is no sky without
clouds. Perhaps even at this moment
your heart may have a little
secret grief; for it is not forbidden
to feel an honest wish to give the
woman you love all possible honor;
<pb n='317'/><anchor id='Pg317'/>
and that cannot be done when one
comes into the world without family
or name.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alas! for the name. I cannot repair
that misfortune; but for the
family, know, my friends, that the
blood of him whom you call son
and brother is equal to yours. In
the name of my conscience, I here
declare that Jeannet is the son of
Catharine Luguet, who died in my
arms sincerely repentant, and most
piously giving me perfect license to
reveal this secret, confided in confession,
when I should judge it
necessary. I have waited a long
time, and I do not regret it. At
no other time, I think, could you
have been happier to hear me tell
such good news. So, Ragaud, embrace
your nephew; and you, my
daughter Jeannette, in taking a
perfect husband, you gain, at the
same time, a good cousin. Too
much happiness never hurts any
one!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah!</q> said Germaine, wiping
her eyes, <q>it was worth while staying
so late to-night. I have been
tempted half a dozen times to tell
what M. le Curé has just made
known; for I also received the
secret from poor dear Catharine,
and even before my master, although
I do not pretend to interfere
with his rights.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>M. le Curé,</q> said Ragaud, <q>if
I am very happy to learn that our
dear child belongs to us by nature
as much as by friendship, believe me
when I say that I am most grateful
to God that, without my knowing
it, he allowed me to repair the too
great severity with which I formerly
treated my niece. Alas! I well remember
it, and most sincerely do I
regret it; and if she gave us this
handsome boy a little too soon, according
to the laws of God and
man, I have no right to blame her,
as I was the cause, from want of
gentleness and kindness! Come,
my son,</q> added the good Christian,
extending his arms to Jeannet&mdash;<q>come,
that I may ask your pardon
in memory of your poor mother.</q>
</p>

<p>
Jean-Louis threw himself on his
father's breast, whom he could not
yet call <hi rend='italic'>dear uncle</hi>, while Jeannette
added her embrace, giving herself
up to the full joy of <hi rend='italic'>cousining</hi> her
future husband. Pierrette had her
full share of kisses, you can well
fancy. It was so delightful to feel
that he really had a family, and was
bound to the country by ties of
flesh and blood, and also to know
that he belonged to the best people
in the neighborhood, the Luguets
and Ragauds, that Jeannet, who in
his whole life never had a spark of
vanity, felt a little glow of excitement
and satisfaction, perfectly natural,
flame up in his heart. But
his beautiful soul quickly drove out
such a feeling, to which he already
reproached himself for having
listened, even for a moment, although
it could be easily understood,
and was honorable in itself.
The remembrance of his unknown
mother, dying in sorrow and want,
and who would have been so happy
could she have witnessed his present
joy, surmounted any personal
satisfaction. He questioned M. le
Curé, and spoke in the most tender
and respectful manner in memory
of his poor mother, and wished to
know every detail of her death,
which was sad, but very consoling
at the same time.
</p>

<p>
Every one listened with much
emotion to poor Catharine's story.
I doubt not that God then permitted
her to know something of the
loving sympathy and compassion
that filled those kind, good hearts,
which most certainly must have
added to her happiness; for, since
<pb n='318'/><anchor id='Pg318'/>
the church commands us to believe
that souls cannot die, can it be
wrong to think that they see and
hear us, when the Lord allows
them?
</p>

<p>
Jeannette, while the <foreign rend='italic'>curé</foreign> spoke,
was often much confused when she
thought of the dangerous result of
coquetry, wilfulness, and too great
love of one's own pretty face and
fine dresses. She felt how kind
God had been to her, that she had
not gone the same way as Catharine
Luguet; for she had walked
down the same path, and had nearly
fallen as low as she.
</p>

<p>
By way of recovering her spirits,
she embraced Jeannet, and promised
she would be a good housekeeper,
and nothing else.
</p>

<p>
<q>And also a pretty little wife,
that will make me very happy,</q> replied
Jeannet, pressing her to his
heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now,</q> said Pierrette, who for
several moments had been very silent
and thoughtful, <q>I have just
found out something that makes
me feel how stupid I am. I never
before noticed that Jeannet is the
living image of his dear departed
mother.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is fortunate, Mme. Ragaud,</q>
said Germaine, <q>that you have just
perceived it, after seeing him twenty
years; for, in truth, the likeness
is so striking it has caused M. le
Curé and me much embarrassment.
It was so easily seen that I prayed
God would protect him in case of
discovery; and if there is one miracle
in the whole story, it is that
such a strong resemblance did not
sooner strike you.</q>
</p>

<p>
As it had just been mentioned, in
the course of the story, that Catharine
Luguet, in her day, was the
most beautiful girl in the country,
this declaration made Jeannet
blush, and I dare not affirm it was
not from pleasure. They discovered,
also, that Solange had a strong
family likeness, and Pierrette, more
and more astonished, acknowledged
it was true, and that she was as
stupid as an owl.
</p>

<p>
They had to separate at last, although
no one felt the least fatigued;
but they had had enough
for one day, and a little sleep after
these heavy showers of happiness
would injure none of them.
</p>

<p>
As the surprises were not yet
over, Jeannet had another charming
one when he saw his room
newly painted and papered, and his
bed, with white curtains, perfumed
with the iris-root that our housekeepers
love to use in the wash.
They installed him like a prefect
on a tour of inspection, with a
procession of lights, and wishes of
good-night, and what do you want,
and there it was, and here it is; and
if he slept quietly is something I
cannot say positively; but, at any
rate, you needn't worry about his
eyes, whether they were open or
shut. What I can swear to is
that his good angel watched joyfully
by his bedside, and took care to
drive off all bad dreams.

<p>
Now, I might make my bow, and
wish you good-night in my turn;
for I think you are satisfied with
the fate of the little ones, and need
have no further anxiety on their
account. But just as two beautiful
roses in a bouquet appear still
more beautiful when they are
surrounded by other flowers and
green leaves that rejoice the eye,
so our friends will lose nothing if
I represent them to you for the last
time among the companions of
their adventures who have served
as an escort during the whole recital.
Consequently, if you will be
<pb n='319'/><anchor id='Pg319'/>
patient a moment and listen to me,
I will tell you what became of the
people and things that have remained
in the background for
some time.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, according to
the proverb, <q>Give every man his
due.</q>
</p>

<p>
So we will commence with our
good master, M. le Marquis, whom
we left, if you remember, wounded
in the arm and seated on a log
near the barricade in the bloody
days of June.
</p>

<p>
This wound, which was believed
to be nothing, became inflamed
and very dangerous, owing to the
great excitement of the patient
and the extreme heat of the summer.
The poor marquis was obliged
to keep his bed for a long time,
and they even feared they would
be obliged to amputate the arm.
When the physicians made the
proposition, he sprang up with a
start on his couch, and, weak and
feverish as he was, did not hesitate
to tell them, in the most emphatic
manner, that the first one who
mentioned it again would go out
of the window with one turn of the
hand that was still sound. They
advised him to be quiet and calm
himself, all the while giving him to
understand there was no hope for
him&mdash;which, in my opinion, was not
the best means of soothing him;
but doctors never wish to be
thought in the wrong, and, without
meaning to offend any one, I may
say very many of us are doctors on
that point.
</p>

<p>
Our master was brave. He contented
himself with saying:
</p>

<p>
<q>I prefer to be buried with two
arms, rather than to live with one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That depends on taste,</q> replied
Michou, who nursed his master
with loving fidelity; <q>but he must
not be contradicted.</q>
</p>

<p>
When the doctors left, M. le
Marquis said to Michou:
</p>

<p>
<q>Come here, old fellow; these
idiots of Parisians know as much
about revolutions and medicine as
planting cabbages. Send for Dr.
Aubry. I can get along with him.</q>
</p>

<p>
M. Aubry was summoned by
telegraph, and God so willed it
that scarcely had he seen the
wound of M. le Marquis than he
shrugged his shoulders, and said
he would answer for him; and
added, with much satisfaction, that
one had to come to Paris to find
doctors that talked like asses and
acted like butchers.
</p>

<p>
He made them bring him a
quantity of pounded ice, which he
applied to the wounded arm, and
took care that our master always
kept a piece in his mouth. In that
way his blood was refreshed, and
there was no longer danger of the
flesh mortifying. He added to
this remedy another potion not
less wonderful, which was to distract
the mind of the marquis by
telling him night and day&mdash;for he
never slept&mdash;all kinds of stories,
sometimes lively, sometimes serious,
but always suitable to his state; and
so kept him constantly amused and
interested, which prevented him
from thinking of his poor arm. At
the end of a week, he was out of
danger, and he could get up, eat
the breast of a chicken, and think
of going out in a few days. If I
would be a little malicious, I could
tell you that the Parisian doctors
were not very well pleased at the
triumph of their country colleague,
and perhaps would have been more
content to see our master dead than
their prophecies frustrated; but
I had better be silent than wanting
in charity, and therefore I prefer
to let you think what you please
about them.
</p>

<pb n='320'/><anchor id='Pg320'/>

<p>
Poor mademoiselle and Dame
Berthe, during this painful time
of anxiety, acted admirably and
showed great devotion and love.
It was then seen that, although
they had their little defects on the
surface, their souls were generous
and good. The old governess forgot
her scarfs and embroideries,
and devoted herself to making lint,
and no longer indulged in dreams
of the king's entrance into Paris,
but constantly recited fervent
prayers, which had not, I assure
you, <q>the cause</q> in view. Mademoiselle
received a salutary blow.
She became, through this trouble,
serious and recollected; began to
see that in Paris nothing is
thought of but pleasure and fine
toilets, and that, after all, at Val-Saint
there were a thousand ways
of passing her life in a pleasant way
worthy of a Christian whom God
had so liberally endowed with
riches.
</p>

<p>
One day, when she had gone out
to pray and weep in a neighboring
church, she returned with her eyes
radiant with joy, and said to Dame
Berthe:
</p>

<p>
<q>All will be right. My father will
be cured. I cannot explain to you
why I am so confident, but I am
sure of it. When I was in the
church before the altar of the
Blessed Virgin, the idea entered
into my head to make a vow; and I
have promised to return to the
country, and remain there the rest
of my life, to work for the poor,
and to occupy myself with all other
kinds of good works, as my mother
used to. I have too long neglected
to follow her example, and
henceforth I will act differently. I
depend upon your assistance.</q>
</p>

<p>
Dame Berthe nearly fainted with
admiration of her pupil's saintliness.
As she was naturally very
good, she was impressed with the
beauty of the project, and promised
to do all in her power to aid her.
</p>

<p>
After that, mademoiselle looked
like another person. She visited
churches and chapels, conferred
with pious priests; and as monsieur
improved every day, he could
accompany her in the carriage;
and she took great pleasure in
confiding to him her new plans,
proving to him that he could be
much more useful to <q>the cause</q>
by instructing the peasants in politics
than by fighting the rabble in
Paris; that, by his great wealth and
the high esteem in which he was
held, he could make himself still
more beloved; and that, when they
loved him, they would love the nobility
which he represented; so that
when the time came&mdash;and it would
not be far off&mdash;for the triumph of
his hopes, he could offer to the
king a faithful population devoted to
good principles, which was scarcely
possible in the present state of
affairs.
</p>

<p>
As she was in this happy frame
of mind, you can imagine with
what joy mademoiselle received the
news of the engagement of Jean-Louis
and Jeanne. She immediately
wrote a letter on the subject
which deserved to be put under
glass and framed in gold; for not
only did she congratulate the Ragauds
with the greatest affection,
but she humbly accused herself of
having nearly ruined the happiness
of her god-daughter, and thanked
God he had directed all in a manner
so contrary to her wishes.
When you think that this high-born
young lady spoke thus to the little
daughter of a farmer on her estate,
we must admire the miracles of the
religion which teaches us that those
who humble themselves shall be exalted;
and I add, for the benefit of
<pb n='321'/><anchor id='Pg321'/>
those who fancy themselves lovers
of equality, and talk all kind of
nonsense about it, that there never
would have been the slightest
chance of planting a seed of it in the
hearts of men, even though it were
no bigger than a grain of millet, if
they had not beforehand received
instructions on that virtue from our
dear mother, the church.
</p>

<p>
About a month afterwards, M. le
Marquis being perfectly cured, they
all returned to Val-Saint; and it is
unnecessary to say how universal
was the joy. It is equally useless
to tell you that their first occupation
was the marriage of our children,
which was so beautiful, so
joyous, so enlivened with the
music of violins and songs, it resembled
that of a prince and princess
in Mother Goose. During a
whole week, the boys of the neighborhood
beat tin pans and fired off
guns under the windows of Muiceron,
as signs of honor and rejoicing.
With us peasants, joy is
always rather noisy, but, at least, it
can be heard very far; and, besides,
as we don't often have a chance of
amusing ourselves, it is best to let
us have our own way.
</p>

<p>
There remains very little more
for me to say, except that mademoiselle
persevered in her laudable
resolutions, and became the angel
of Val-Saint. One of her first good
acts was to buy the house of the
unfortunate Perdreaux, which, since
the sad end of its masters, had remained
deserted and shut up, no
one daring to put it up at auction.
Mademoiselle sent for workmen,
who soon transformed it into a
fine school-house, divided into two
parts by a garden, where nothing
was spared in fruit-trees, flowers,
and vegetables. The following
year the school was ready for occupation,
and the Sisters were placed
in charge of the girls, and a good
teacher over the boys. By good
luck, they were able to obtain Solange,
who came among the first.
Thus all our friends met again, and
formed one family, of which the
good God was the true father.
</p>

<p>
M. le Curé was very old when he
died, and Germaine soon followed
him. This good pastor left many
regrets which are not yet assuaged;
but he departed from this world
happy that he saw all his children
around him leading good, holy
lives; and at the moment he expired,
they heard him softly repeat
the <hi rend='italic'>Nunc dimittis servum tuum,
Domine, secundum verbum tuum in
pace</hi>&mdash;which is a prayer of compline,
printed in all the Breviaries.
</p>

<p>
Muiceron continued to prosper
under the management of good
Jeannet and his dear wife. The
Ragauds passed their old age in
a dream of happiness, free from
clouds, amidst the love and respect
of the community. Pierrette, who
had never sinned but from weakness
of heart, was never cured of
this defect. On the contrary, it increased;
and she devoted herself so
completely to spoiling the beautiful
children that Jeanne gave her, that
more than once the parents had to
cry, Stop! But aside from these little
troubles, which did not cause
much difficulty, peace and concord
never ceased to reign in this house
of benediction.
</p>

<p>
As the last flower in the crown,
I will tell you that M. Aubry, who
was not remarkable for devotion,
was taken in hand by Sister Solange,
and quietly converted. He swore
a little at first, as might have been
expected, and said it was a shame,
at his age, to fall into the net of a
doctor in <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>cornette</foreign> and petticoats,
at whose birth he had been present,
and whom he had vaccinated; but
<pb n='322'/><anchor id='Pg322'/>
the end of all was, the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>cornette</foreign> led
him by the nose to Mass and confession,
where he was seen to weep,
although he tried to be very firm.
As he was a good man, frank and
open in all he did, once the step
was taken, he did not go back; and
I knew him a long while, and never
saw him act but like a perfect
Christian.
</p>

<p>
And now, at this late hour, I
pray that God may send down
upon you, as well as myself, his
choicest blessings, without which,
you may truly believe, there is nothing
worth living for here below.

<head>Public Worship.</head>

<p>
Few observing persons have
failed to remark the great change
which within a few years has been
wrought in the ideas of people at
large in regard to public worship.
It is not confined to any one of the
religious denominations around us.
It pervades all, from the High-Church
Episcopalian to those who
still cling to the law of Moses. Insensibly,
it may be, but surely,
the growth has all been in one
direction, as surely as the germ in
the earth pushes towards the light.
</p>

<p>
Time was when the plain, unadorned
meeting-house of the Society
of Friends seemed the type
all sought to attain in architecture;
painting and decoration would have
caused a thrill of horror; Gothic
architecture, with groined roof and
stained glass, were as far removed
from the thoughts and ideas as the
Crusades; and if the sister art of
music was admitted within the
portals of the room reserved for
worship, the execution was of such
a fearful character that Old Folks'
Concerts make it a sure guide to
success, to mimic, for the amusement
of this generation, the strange
religious music of half a century
ago.
</p>

<p>
Then religion, as expressed in
public worship, was plain, stern,
hard, unsympathetic, responsive to
none of the finer feelings, the loftier
aspirations, the panting hopes of
human nature feeling its misery, but
still looking heavenward.
</p>

<p>
Now the change has come. Insensibly,
almost unconsciously, they
have all more or less come to confess
their error. Just as they are
returning to the genuine Lord's
Prayer, after inflicting a spurious
one on their votaries for three centuries;
just as they are returning to
the true reading of the Greek Testament,
after three centuries' bondage
to the Received Text, so they
are returning, after three centuries
of dry, hard, formal worship, to
something more in unison with
man's nature, man's soul, and man's
heart.
</p>

<p>
But how? The Reformation, that
stern, matter-of-fact revolt, not only
stripped religion of all its poetry,
whether manifested in the carven
stone, the painted glass or canvas,
the strains of more than earthly
music, but it did more: it struck at
the life of worship; and the present
movement which has made synagogues
into temples and meeting-houses
<pb n='323'/><anchor id='Pg323'/>
into churches&mdash;the work of
men who <q>builded better than they
knew</q>&mdash;yet is but a factitious life;
it is placing artificial fruit and
leaves and flowers on a dead trunk
that has no vivifying sap to send
through all the full, gushing tide of
life.
</p>

<p>
What is public worship?
</p>

<p>
Is there really a question of the
day that can be brought home to
practical men like our American
countrymen more distinctly than
this? Long creeds and the discussion
of their various points, the
old controversies and chopping of
texts, seem to have become singularly
distasteful to the men of our day.
But the divine worship is a point
that, presented squarely and plainly,
is easily grasped, and really involves
in itself everything. It is
the generating principle, the fountain
of faith and works.
</p>

<p>
About a century ago, in London,
the question of worship was debated
by some of the leading ministers
of the day, and the pamphlets form
volumes. A more vague series of
arguments on all sides can scarcely
be found; all seemed to turn round
and round the text that men were
to <q>worship God in spirit and
truth,</q> but in what precise way
was a matter none seemed able to
approach, even in the most remote
manner. What constituted practically
the public worship of the
Almighty seemed to be a point that
was utterly indefinite and indefinable.
</p>

<p>
Suppose, now, we were to ask the
clergymen or laymen of the denominations
around us, What is
the essential element of public
worship, as distinguished, on the
one hand, from preaching, and on
the other from family worship of
prayer? What would the answer
be?
</p>

<p>
Public worship has, in common
ideas, come to be almost identical
with preaching. The preacher
makes the church; his popularity is
its success; with his decline in
health, vigor, or voice, the church
begins to melt away, and a new
preacher has to be evoked to give
it life. But oral instruction of the
people, laudable as it may be, is not
public worship; it is addressed to
the people, while worship is addressed
to God. The prevailing confusion
of ideas on this point has
turned the extemporaneous prayers
which in form are still addressed
to the Deity really into appeals to
the people; so that the reporter
who spoke of a prayer as being the
most eloquent ever addressed to
a Boston congregation was correct
in fact, though the form was against
him.
</p>

<p>
Preaching does not constitute
public worship. The object of
preaching is the people; the object
of worship is God.
</p>

<p>
What, then, is the essential element?
Prayer recited or chanted&mdash;prayer
extemporaneous or in forms
grown venerable by use, is common
alike to public and private
worship, to the worship of the individual
in his closet, the family, or
the gathering of families. It cannot
be the essential element of
public worship. What, then, is the
essential element, or, if there be
none, how can this public worship
have any claim on the individual
that may not be satisfied by him
alone, as in the case of Dr. Bellows'
preferring isolation on the steamer's
deck to joining in the religious
exercises carried on below?
</p>

<p>
But there is certainly an obligation
to render public worship to the
Almighty. The Sabbath rest prescribed
by the Mosaic law was negative
and subsidiary to the positive
<pb n='324'/><anchor id='Pg324'/>
command to worship God. It did
not tell what was to be done; that
was provided elsewhere with the
most detailed injunctions.
</p>

<p>
Even as ideas have changed on
one point, so they have on another.
</p>

<p>
With the Reformers of the XVIth
century, faith was all and everything.
Now we have reached a
time when faith has lost its ground;
and, in the thousands around us,
nine out of ten will tell you that
it makes no difference what a
man believes; if his life is right,
he is safe. But yet they make
a distinction in works. It is not
all works that have value in the
eyes of the world; it is those of
benevolence&mdash;the corporal works
of mercy. They will shrug their
shoulders and allow some little
value to the spiritual works of
mercy, but it will not be much.
Yet these works of mercy, whether
corporal or spiritual, have for their
object our neighbor. There is,
however, a higher class of works&mdash;those
which have God for their object.
</p>

<p>
Good works towards God! some
will exclaim; what need has God
of our good works? The need
may be on our side, and the question
is not one of need, but of duty
on our part.
</p>

<p>
Love is the fulfilling of the law&mdash;<q>he
that loveth me keepeth my
commandments.</q> The Commandments
to be kept, the works to be
done, are written on the two tables
of the law; and the works to be
done towards God form the first
and greater Commandment, and
foremost on it&mdash;first of the good
works of which God is the object&mdash;is
worship, public and private.
</p>

<p>
Have not common ideas, then,
perverted the whole order? With
the higher appreciation of good
works that is growing so visibly
will come a logical placing of them.
The first table will reassert its
rights; the great good work towards
God, public worship, will take its
rightful place, and be regarded as
the great, imperative act on the
part of man.
</p>

<p>
If so important, it must have its
distinctive characteristics, its essential
elements&mdash;some thymiama exclusively
assigned to it, never given,
we say, not to any mean use, but to
high or holy use or honor of anything
that is not God.
</p>

<p>
Should no one around us tell
what this element is, we must go
back to the past. The first Commandment,
in its positive form, is:
<q>The Lord thy God thou shalt
adore, and him only shalt thou
serve.</q> In what essentially does
this adoration and service consist?
</p>

<p>
If we open the two oldest books
we have&mdash;the Bible, record of a people
who preserved their faith in
God; Homer, describing the life of
a nation fallen so early into idolatry
that it preserved no tradition
of the time when the unity of God
was acknowledged&mdash;if we open
these to see what in the earliest
ages constituted divine worship, we
find the answer clear and plain&mdash;Sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
Leave the shores of the Mediterranean,
strike to India, China, the
islands of the Pacific, and ask what
constitutes public worship, the answer
still is, Sacrifice. Reach the
western shores of America, question
every tribe, from the more
savage nomads of the north and
south to the more cultured Aztecs,
to the subjects of the Incas, and
the answer never varies; it is, Sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
Cross the Atlantic as you crossed
the Pacific, the Celts of the Isles
and of Gaul, Scandinavian and
<pb n='325'/><anchor id='Pg325'/>
German, repeat the burden, Sacrifice,
till you come again to the
tents of the patriarchs on the plains
of the Euphrates or Jordan.
</p>

<p>
And what was sacrifice? A rite
cruel, repugnant to all our ideas&mdash;one
that could not spring from man
himself. It was the offering of an
inferior life to the offended Deity
as a substitute for man's life forfeited
by sin&mdash;a substitute deriving
its value from a human life that was
one day to appease the Almighty
absolutely.
</p>

<p>
The whole system is strange, yet
the whole is universal. Before
man slew the beasts of the field for
food, he slew them on the altar.
Not Cain, unaccepted of God, offers
this bloody sacrifice. Doubly the
type of sinful man&mdash;sinful by descent
and by act&mdash;Cain offers the
fruits of the earth&mdash;badge of sin and
toil and sweat of brow; while Abel,
pure and gentle, slays the lamb that
gambols affectionately around him&mdash;slays
it to find favor with a God
of love. It could not have entered
into the heart of man to conceive
this. Nothing less than a primitive
revelation and command can
explain sacrifice&mdash;that offering of
domestic animals as a type of the
great atoning sacrifice of the Lamb
slain from the foundation of the
world.
</p>

<p>
No matter how widely removed
from the original seat of the race,
no matter how low in the grade of
civilization, every known tribe on
earth has a worship and has sacrifices.
The red men of our own
land were long considered as an
anomaly in this respect; but they
really had the whole idea of sacrifice.
One example will show it.
When F. Jogues, the pioneer priest
of New York, was taken by the
Mohawks in 1642, and reduced to
the condition of a slave, he attended
a hunting party of the tribe.
Ill success in war and hunt had
befallen the Mohawks, and, ascribing
it to their offended deity, they
offered to this demon Aireskoi two
bears with this prayer: <q>Justly dost
thou punish us, O demon Aireskoi!...
We have sinned against
thee, in that we ate not the last captives
thrown into our hands; but
if we shall ever again capture
any, we promise to devour them as
we now consume these two bears</q>&mdash;recognizing
the idea of substitution
and the efficacy of human
blood as the great means of
reconciliation. And the missionary,
to his horror, saw two women
sacrificed and eaten in fulfilment
of this vow.
</p>

<p>
While the temple of Jerusalem
stood, the Greek, the Roman, the
Egyptian, the Gaul, and the German
would, on entering, have seen
naught removed from their ideas in
the sacrifice offered. They might
have wondered at the size and beauty
of the temple, the rich vestments
of the sons of Aaron; they might
have been filled with awe at the
absence of the image of the deity
worshipped there so grandly; but
in the great rite of sacrifice, there
was nothing that was not familiar
to them. In this the pagan nations
were still in harmony with
the divine institution; and in default
of the Mosaic revelation, its
appositeness could be proved by
the common consent of mankind
in a matter inexplicable except
on the supposition of a primitive
revelation.
</p>

<p>
The nearer and more striking
the resemblance between the pagan
sacrifices and those of the people
of God, the greater the evidence
they bear to corroborate it. Error
may be old, but truth is older.
</p>

<p>
What, then, is the meaning of
<pb n='326'/><anchor id='Pg326'/>
this ancient worship? The answer
is plain: <q>Jesus Christ, yesterday
and to-day and for ever</q>&mdash;<q>the
Lamb slain from the foundation
of the world,</q> whose death
was, when once accomplished in
act, to be thenceforward shown
forth until he came.
</p>

<p>
The offering on Calvary alone
gave life and efficacy to all the
sacrifices of Adam, of the patriarchs
before and after the Flood, of the
sacrifices of Abraham, and those
who, in his day, still believed in the
true God, in the sacrifices of the
law promulgated by Moses.
</p>

<p>
Their sacrifices were but types
and figures&mdash;substitutes for that
which was to be accomplished in
the person of the Messias; when
that was once accomplished, it became
the act of public worship, to
be offered by man to the end of
time.
</p>

<p>
The public worship of the new
law is the sacrifice of Calvary, not
renewed, not repeated&mdash;for <q>Christ
dieth now no more</q>&mdash;but <q>shown
forth,</q> made sensible.
</p>

<p>
The essential element of public
worship is the death of the Man-God
on Calvary; and under the
new law, this must be shown in
something higher and nobler than
the types and animal sacrifices of
the old law. It is the one sufficient
act of worship, fulfilling all
the intentions and designs of the
ancient typical sacrifices&mdash;adoration,
praise, thanksgiving, propitiation,
and impetration. No public
worship that does not directly connect
itself with this great sacrifice
can be at all a public worship acceptable
to God.
</p>

<p>
The Almighty has certainly instituted
a worship showing forth this
death, and that alone will he accept.
</p>

<p>
Man cannot set up a public worship
for himself. Worship is a
debt which man owes to the Most
High, and it is not for the debtor
to fix the mode of paying that
debt. In the discussion alluded to
already, they frequently quoted the
words of Jesus to the Samaritan
woman, but overlooked the great
lesson of that whole incident.
When that erring woman, pressed
hard on her moral delinquency,
changed the subject, with womanly
adroitness, to the great religious
division between the Jews and
Samaritans, she asked: <q>Our fathers
adored on this mountain; and
you say that at Jerusalem is the
place that men must adore</q>&mdash;meaning,
evidently, <q>offer the sacrifices
of the law.</q>
</p>

<p>
Christ answered: <q>Salvation is
with the Jews.</q> The Mosaic
church was the ark, and out of it
there was no salvation. And yet
the Samaritans had, according to
modern ideas, every requisite. They
had the law of Moses, and revered
and followed it closely; they had
priests of the sons of Aaron, won
to their side; they offered all the
sacrifices commanded by the law,
and as the law commanded; and
they had and exercised the right
of private judgment in the matter
of the place. And precisely this
last point vitiated the whole, and
made their sacrifices utterly worthless
in the eyes of God. They did
not conduce to salvation. To be
in the way of salvation, they must
be in communion with the high-priest
at Jerusalem, and their sacrifices
could not be vivified by man
or angel. They were worthless.
<q>Salvation was with the Jews.</q>
</p>

<p>
The essential element of public
worship is, then, the sacrifice of
Calvary; and the public worship of
the new law must be connected
with that act by divine institution.
No institution devised by private
<pb n='327'/><anchor id='Pg327'/>
judgment, however seemingly fit to
human eyes, can have any real
value. It is not for man to make,
by his private judgment, a form
of public worship that will avoid
the sentence, <q>Salvation is not in
it.</q> As the figurative sacrifices of
the old law derived their value from
divine institution as typical of Calvary,
so the public worship of the
new law must be connected with
Calvary by divine institution.
</p>

<p>
Now, in the popular forms of
public worship in our days, there is
no essential element, either of divine
or human creation, to connect
it with Calvary. It is inferior even
to the Samaritan worship, which
Christ so decisively condemned.
What claims, then, can it have?
</p>

<p>
The Catholic who is asked why
he cannot attend a Protestant worship
finds his answer here. <q>Why,</q>
it will be said, <q>there can be no
harm in it. Reading the Scriptures,
singing psalms out of Holy
Writ, and a moral explanation of
some part of Scripture cannot but be
good.</q> Even supposing the explanation
to contain nothing contrary
to faith, a Catholic cannot accept
it. It is not of God's institution,
and, as unauthorized and human,
must be rejected of God. There
was no detail in the Samaritan worship
that a Jew could condemn,
yet he had to condemn it as a
whole; for, by God's institution, all
this, done on Mount Sion, was acceptable
to him and contributed to
salvation; done elsewhere, was repugnant
and availed not.
</p>

<p>
So absolute is the necessity of
adhering to divine institution to
give any value to our religious acts
that we see in the Acts that the
Jewish priests, whose authority had
been so fully sustained, were, by the
institution of the priesthood of the
new law, superseded; and when they
attempted to exercise functions under
the new law, the very devils
laughed them to scorn. If men of
a priesthood instituted by God had
thus lost power, how could men
self-constituted make themselves
more acceptable, or create a form
of worship that could be acceptable,
to God?
</p>

<p>
Nor can any such power exist
in the civil authority, be it emperor,
king, parliament, or congress.
Saul, usurping the headship of the
church and the functions of the
priesthood, only drew down judgment
on himself, and his race
ceased to rule over the people.
</p>

<p>
The only example in the old law
that even remotely resembles the
liberty assumed in the last centuries
by men to form modes of worship
is that of Michas in the Book
of Judges, who made his own god,
his own temple, his worship, and
constituted one of his sons as
priest till he was able to obtain an
apostate Levite.
</p>

<p>
Man, of himself, would have as
much right to make his god like
Michas as to make his worship.
He can make neither, and cannot
give saving power to his form of
worship any more than he can divinity
to the deity his brain may
devise.
</p>

<p>
Let us, then, see whether there
exists under the new law an institution
in which the one great sacrifice
of Calvary is made perpetually
present to the end of time. The
Reformers, before introducing their
own experimental forms of public
worship, since so varied&mdash;now reduced
to the plainest form, then
more cheering, but all based on the
synagogue service of the Jews,
which was not divine worship, as
the temple service was&mdash;rejected a
form of public worship coeval and
coextensive with Christendom, full
<pb n='328'/><anchor id='Pg328'/>
of the spirit and echo of the temple
service of Jerusalem, that was really
and solely divine worship&mdash;they
rejected the Mass.
</p>

<p>
The Jews even now recognize that
their synagogue service is not worship;
they still admit the necessity
of a sacrifice, as witness one of the
most common forms of prayer offered
up in the synagogue: <q>O Lord,
in the time when the temple stood,
when a sin was committed the guilty
one brought sacrifices, and it was
atoned unto him; but now, through
our sins, we have no temple, no altar,
no priests to offer up sacrifices
which shall atone for our sins. Let
the remembrance of our prayers, of
the many prayers we offer up, O
Lord, be acceptable in the place of
sacrifices.</q>
</p>

<p>
There had been heresies and
schisms before the XVIth century.
They had been almost countless;
but Arian and Pelagian, Donatist
and Nestorian, all retained the
Mass, the authority of all tradition,
in Asia, Europe, and Africa, making
it too daring an attempt for any to
endeavor to modify or abolish it.
By the concurrent testimony of all
Christians of every tongue and land
the Mass was the public worship
of God, instituted by the apostles
under the command of Jesus Christ
and the direction of the Holy
Ghost; and to this day it is retained
in the Oriental lands, where the
apostles and their immediate successors
preached, although many
of those countries have for centuries
rejected the spiritual authority
of Rome, and would not adopt the
slightest form or ceremony peculiar
to the Latin Church.
</p>

<p>
A movement against the Mass
could not arise in any of these lands.
It could arise only in nations just
emerged from the darkness of paganism,
with its spirit still strong
within them, and with no apostolic
tradition to inspire them with reverence.
</p>

<p>
The German race, last to accept
the Gospel, was the first to reject it.
The Real Presence was denied, and
with that dogma they cast aside the
Mass as the great act of public worship,
and the whole theory of the
Christian priesthood. In England
alone an attempt was made to keep
a hollow form and a compromise
which James I. sneeringly styled an
ill-said Mass.
</p>

<p>
In each country, government or
individuals then attempted to get
up something to take the place of
the public worship which had for
fifteen centuries gathered Christians
around the altar of God, and,
while all cried for liberty, made the
new forms obligatory by civil law;
and in England, the government, by
fine and imprisonment, compelled
men to go to the churches torn
from Catholic worship, in order to
follow the newly-devised common
prayer; and in New England, men
who turned with loathing from this,
punished just as stringently all
who dissented from the standing
order or refused to attend the
congregational form of worship.
Yet both were confessedly mere
human inventions, to which no
more divine sanction could be
ascribed than to the form of opening
a court of justice.
</p>

<p>
Of course the first generation of
the Reformed recollected the old
Catholic worship, and kept up some
resemblance to it; but as the memory
died away, one point after another
was cast aside, till every original
trace was lost, and everything was
made as bald and plain as possible.
</p>

<p>
Then a new great discovery was
made. Satisfied with their own
position, they looked at the Catholic
worship, now become strange and
<pb n='329'/><anchor id='Pg329'/>
wonderful in their eyes, and they
discovered a striking analogy between
it and pagan worship. Middleton,
in the last century, expatiated
wonderfully on the point; and
our readers know how offensively
our fluent, superficial Prescott, in
his <hi rend='italic'>Conquest of Mexico</hi>, draws the
comparison. But these men never
seem to have thought that God
might have his own views of his
own worship, and that he could not
have left the world without a guide
on this point; they forgot that one
fully explained type of worship of
the ante-Christian era was before us
to guide us in our search.
</p>

<p>
Take one of our average countrymen,
from Prescott's own State, and
set him down in the temple of
Jerusalem while the high-priest
was still offering the sacrifices of
the law. What would his impressions
be? He would certainly
deem it a very pagan affair; the
architecture would, in his eyes, be
unsuited to a meeting-house; the
vestments heathenish or&mdash;what to
him would perhaps be synonymous&mdash;popish;
the incense clearly so; and
a radical defect in the whole would
be, in his eyes, that the congregation
took no part, and that the building
was not adapted to preaching.
</p>

<p>
If, at the morning hour of prayer,
or when the shadow of Mount Sion
fell lengthening towards the Mediterranean,
he entered the sacred
enclosure, and beheld the priest, in
rich robe, enter, incense in hand, to
offer it on the golden altar, while
the people were kept rigorously
without, he would have found it
sadly at variance with his ideas.
</p>

<p>
If, as the sun began to gild the
golden face of the tower, he saw a
devout Jew coming with his wife
and little ones, bearing in his arms
a lamb, to have it offered in sacrifice
for him or some sick child at
home, and taking back part to eat
as part of the religious rite, he
would think all this needed reforming,
and that it was very nearly as
bad as the popish way of having
Masses said.
</p>

<p>
The only question would be
whether the Almighty was wrong,
or whether his own stand-point was
utterly wrong.
</p>

<p>
Certainly, neither in the Jewish
temple service nor in the worship
of any pagan nation could he find
the type of his own. The pagan
had strong and striking resemblances
with the Jewish; the worship
of Christendom grew out of the
Jewish temple service.
</p>

<p>
To this day chants echo through
Catholic aisles that were first heard
on Mount Sion. To the Catholic
the old temple service would be
intelligible; the edifice, the vestments,
the incense, the priestly
performing of a great act, would all
be in harmony with ideas with
which he had been imbued from
youth; to him there would be the
most natural of natural things in
having sacrifice offered for him or
his; he would kneel without in the
crowd, offering, through the priest
within, the smoking incense&mdash;offering
it, as each one around him did,
for his own wants of soul or body.
In all the ideas of worship of the
Jew he would be at home, and
could join in the same spirit in
every religious act that marked life
from circumcision till the Kadisch,
or prayer for the dead, poured
forth beside the grave in the valley
of Josaphat.
</p>

<p>
Those who find the Catholic
worship too like the pagan would
have condemned the divinely-instituted
worship of the Mosaic law
as still more like it. That paganism
bears its testimony to the
Catholic worship is an argument
<pb n='330'/><anchor id='Pg330'/>
in its favor, not against it; for the
pagan worship was a divine institution,
perverted more in its object
than in its form. Had it been
purely the coinage of man's brain,
of man's private judgment&mdash;one of
those ways that seem right unto a
man, though the ends thereof lead
to death&mdash;there would be no such
resemblance.
</p>

<p>
Is it not a striking fact that the
Catholic, trained to the worship of
his church, would be at home in the
temple of Jerusalem during that
divinely-instituted worship, while
to the Protestant it would be utterly
repugnant?
</p>

<p>
The Mass in Latin, Greek, Coptic,
Armenian, Abyssinian, Sclavonic,
is almost identical, and in all
rites claims to have been instituted
by the apostles by divine authority.
The form is the same,
though varying parts have varied.
The Jewish worship was simply action;
the Christian worship has,
from the earliest period, combined
action and a form of words. The
language of the Mass is older than
any of the books of the New Testament.
Is it unworthy of the great
act? The answer will best be a
challenge to produce anything, from
the days of the Reformation, which
can at all approach it in grandeur;
in its recognition of all the attributes
of God and of the nothingness of man
in his sight; in all and everything
that could embody the idea of worship.
It has, perhaps, the most sublime
thought ever written. Longinus
quoted the <q>Let there be light,
and there was light,</q> as a sublime
thought that paganism admired. Yet
this record of the creative act is less
sublime than <q>We thank thee for thy
great glory.</q> That man, the creature
of God, should thank him for existence,
for his intellect and body,
for truth imparted, for life, health,
happiness, for loved ones and their
love, for all the blessings ever bestowed
on him, or, soaring higher,
ever bestowed on men and angels,
might be admirable; but when man,
losing sight entirely of himself and
of all created things, looks up to
God, and, overwhelmed with love,
thanks him for his great glory, for
his attributes, for being what he is,
he soars from the depths of nothingness
to the height of sublimity. One
of the modern objections to religion
is its selfish character; the Mass
answers this by its utter abnegation
of self, just as it formally disavows
the sufficiency of human works.
</p>

<p>
The action is worthy of divine
worship. A man stands at the
altar, not self-instituted, but called
as Aaron and his race were&mdash;stands
there with powers traced back
through the apostles to Christ. He
approaches as a sinner among sinners,
acknowledging his unworthiness,
striking his breast with the
publican, not vaunting himself with
the Pharisee. Then follow soon
the glorious canticle, in which the
sinner rises, in thought and hope,
to God, prayer, lessons from the
Old Testament or the New, a portion
of the gospels, a solemn profession
of faith. Then properly begins
the Sacrifice, at which, in early days,
only the baptized could be present,
and not even such of them as were
subjects of public penance.
</p>

<p>
Bread and wine appear on the
altar. Even among the pagans,
fruits of the earth were offered to
inferior deities alone. In the Bible,
they mark the sinful race, like Cain,
or men without the chosen people,
like Melchisedec. It is in itself an
inferior offering, and bears the
stamp of man's fall. Bread and
wine are doubly suggestive. It is
not merely fruits of the earth raised
by man's toil and the sweat of
<pb n='331'/><anchor id='Pg331'/>
his brow; it is food prepared by
still further toil.
</p>

<p>
The priest stands there as the
type of fallen man, with such offering
as fallen man can give; but if
this were all, his sacrifice would be
but that of Melchisedec. His language
shows that the sacrifice has,
so to speak, no beginning or end;
that it is one act, and that time is
not regarded. The bread and wine
are treated, not as what they are,
but what they are to become. It is
not that the sacrifice of guilty Cain
may become that of the pious Abel,
the sacrifice of the uncalled Melchisedec
become that of Abraham
the elect; not that this sacrifice of
fallen man may become the Paschal
lamb, but Christ our Pasch
himself; and such it is in thought
already when the priest offers the
bread as an immaculate host, and
the wine as the chalice of salvation&mdash;offers
them for his own sins and
those of all Christians; for the salvation
of those present and that
of the whole world. He offers it
again in memory of the passion,
resurrection, and ascension of our
Lord, and in honor of all who have
faithfully served him on earth.
</p>

<p>
He never separates himself from
the people for whom he offers it.
From the commencement to the
end, it is their sacrifice and his; in
fact, as if to prevent any forgetfulness
of this, he turns, as the awful
moment of consecration approaches,
to say: <q>Brethren, pray that
my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable
to God, the Father Almighty.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then, with the Preface that
sounds like the triumphant march
of an approaching monarch, comes
the consecration. The types of
sinful man disappear, and Jesus
Christ is all. He is the priest; he is
the victim. He makes the only oblation
that can take away sin. He
offers the only victim which can
render his Eternal Father due adoration,
homage, and honor; which
can alone call down graces and
blessings.
</p>

<p>
The priest and people, adoring
the divine High-Priest and Victim,
offer through him that sacrifice of
Calvary for all mankind, for the
living and the dead, for the church
and all its members. Then, repeating
the prayer he himself enjoined,
the divine Victim is consumed,
and the solemn rite hastens
to a close.
</p>

<p>
Sublime in its conception, sublime
in all its parts, sublime alike
in action and in words, the world
has never beheld a more adequate
public worship of God. In itself,
in its antiquity, its wide extent, it is
one of the strongest arguments in
favor of the church. Its wonderful
adaptability to all nations and all
conditions of social elevation are
no less striking. A public worship,
in which the most polished and cultivated
minds of civilized nations
can join, absorbed and taking part,
while the poor peasant enters as
well into its spirit, and offers it for
all his wants; a sacrifice that can
come home to the savage and the
sage, to men of the frozen North
and the parching tropics, which
makes the church a home in all
lands where not a syllable uttered
in the streets falls familiar on the
ear&mdash;such is the Holy Sacrifice of
the Mass of the Catholic Church&mdash;a
worship distinct from any other
service, offered to God alone, and
combining in the highest degree
everything that can be conceived
as fitting in that great act&mdash;divine
institution, the character of sacrifice,
identity with the oblation of
Calvary&mdash;the only adequate worship
ever offered to God.

<p>
From that day I resumed my
former habits, and, except the liveliness
of my childhood, which had
disappeared never to return, I became
almost the same as before.
This sudden and unhoped-for restoration
brought cheerfulness once
more to our gloomy house, and a
ray of joy to the sad, anxious face
of my father. I say anxious; for it
was more so, if possible, than sad.
There was an anxiety in his look,
whenever he turned towards me,
that was quite inexpressible. Had
he so trembled for my life, and
afterwards for my reason, as hardly
to credit I was restored to him?
Perhaps so; but if his anxiety had
really outlived its cause, though
that might explain his profound
solicitude, it could not account for
the coldness of manner he now
manifested, instead of the warm affection
to which he had accustomed
me from infancy. And when I endeavored
to fathom the cause of
this change, only one reason occurred
to me, which I repelled with
terror, and on which my mind utterly
refused to dwell!...
</p>

<p>
I had not seen my brother (the
elder of the two children by my father's
first marriage) since my illness.
When I went to the supper-table
for the first time, he was not
there. But this did not cause me
any great regret, for I feared Mario
more than I loved him. I was
glad, therefore, to find no one present
but my father, my sister Livia,
and Ottavia, who, from a waiting-maid,
had merited, from her long services,
to be promoted to a duenna. I
say <foreign rend='italic'>duenna</foreign>, and not governess; for
she would scarcely have been able
to teach us to read and write. But
she knew many things much more
important. She was one of those
good, simple souls, so frequently
met with in Italy among people of
her station, uncultivated from a
human point of view, but wonderfully
conversant with everything
relating to the principles of the
Christian religion, the practice of
charity, and the grandeur of the
Christian's hopes. Sometimes
thoughts came spontaneously from
her heart and lips which were far
more admirable than are to be found
in any book. Therefore my father,
notwithstanding her undeniable ignorance
in many respects, did not
consider her useless in the training
of his children, but treated her
with a consideration bordering on
respect.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto my life had been surrounded
by, and, so to speak, permeated
with a mother's love; and
when I was suddenly deprived of
this light and warmth, an overpowering
grief, as has been related,
took possession of my soul, which
at first it seemed impossible I could
survive. Now I was calmer; but
there was still a void, a wretchedness,
a grief in my heart, which,
<pb n='334'/><anchor id='Pg334'/>
though not as violent as at first, had
become fixed and permanent. I
thought sometimes of young birds,
whose mothers had been caught in
the fowler's net, left pining alone in
their nests, or of poor little fish
drawn out of the water and left on
the shore in the heat of the sun. I
seemed to be like them: my heart
and soul were out of their element
and deprived of their necessary
food.
</p>

<p>
In this state, Ottavia and my
kind sister Livia were the only persons
in the house who afforded
me any comfort. I always sought
shelter beside them; for the sight
of my father increased my depression,
and I was afraid of my brother's
stern and penetrating eye.
</p>

<p>
Mario, at this time, was twenty-seven
years of age. He was remarkably
handsome at first sight;
but his stern, gloomy face, seldom
expressive of kindness, and never
of affection, greatly modified this
first impression, and it was nearly
impossible to feel entirely at ease
with him. Nevertheless, he had
many noble qualities, and in some
respects resembled my father; but
he had not inherited his kindness
of heart.... My brother was unyielding
and jealous, and, if not
bad at heart, at least had an unpleasant
disposition, and was often
in an insupportable humor. He
made me habitually feel that he regarded
me as the child of a different
mother, and could not forgive
Livia, who was his own sister, for
loving one who, according to him,
had come to rob them of the full
share of their father's love.
</p>

<p>
At the time of Fabrizio dei Monti's
second marriage, Mario, then
only twelve years old, had manifested
so great a repugnance to it,
and so much ill-will towards her
who was about to take his mother's
place at their fireside, that Fabrizio
decided to send him away; and for
several years Mario lived away
from home, only returning from
time to time for an occasional visit.
It was only within a year he had
become a permanent member of
the household. At that time the
malady that was to prove fatal to
my mother had begun its ravages,
and the remaining days of her life
were already numbered. Whether
it was this knowledge, or because
he was softened and disarmed by
the charm of her beauty and the
angelic sweetness of her manner,
it is certain he became quite a different
person, and, in her presence
at least, was never harsh or severe
towards us. Perhaps this change
would have been complete could
he have remained longer under the
sweet influence we were all so unhappily
deprived of!
</p>

<p>
On the 15th of July&mdash;the day
that ended so fatally&mdash;Mario was
absent. He had left home the
evening before, and, when he returned,
he learned, at the same
time, the calamity that had occurred
and that which so speedily
threatened to follow. I have been
assured that he manifested a lively
grief at my mother's death, and
had inquired about me, not only
with interest, but even with anxiety.
But the recollections of the
past were still vividly impressed on
my memory, and it was not to him
my heavy, bleeding heart turned
for consolation at such a time.
</p>

<p>
At the end of our gloomy repast,
my sister was informed that there
were several visitors in the drawing-room.
It was the hour when
my father received his friends and
the clients he had not been able to
see in the morning. Livia immediately
left the table, and I was
about to follow her, when my father
<pb n='335'/><anchor id='Pg335'/>
stopped me, and kept me beside
him till he had looked over some
documents which had just been
brought him. He then gave me
his arm to the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salon</foreign>. This was
certainly done with kindness and
an air of affection, but with a kind
of gravity constantly perceptible as
he kept me beside him the remainder
of the evening. How gladly I
would have exchanged this affectionate
solicitude, that could not
lose sight of me, for one such look
as I used to receive!...
</p>

<p>
It was strange! but when I
thought of my mother, no remorse
was mingled with so affecting a remembrance.
I felt as if a constant
communication was maintained between
her soul and mine; that she
<emph>saw</emph> my repentance, was aware of
my resolutions, and, to sum up my
impressions&mdash;childish, perhaps, but
so lively and profound that they
have never been effaced&mdash;that
<hi rend='italic'>peace had been made between us</hi>.
But the thought that my father
might be aware of all that took
place during that hour of fearful
memory, or the possibility of his
knowing the foolish act I committed
in my mother's presence, alas!
while she was dying, and that he
might attribute the dreadful catastrophe
that followed to that act,
inspired me with genuine terror,
which was only checked by a secret,
constant conviction that my mother
had not been able, during the few
short hours of the following night,
to divulge my secret to any one,
even to him. But then, who could
have told him, or what other reason
could there be for the change that
made me feel as if I had lost my
father as well as my mother, and
that the heavens were darkened on
that side also?
</p>

<p>
The next day I was alone in
my chamber, collecting my books
in order to resume my studies, as
if my mother were still alive to
direct me, when my sister came in
breathless, as if from running. She
stopped to take breath, and locked
the door before speaking.
</p>

<p>
Livia was two years younger than
her brother. She was not handsome;
but her form was noble and
graceful, her eyes were strikingly
beautiful, and her smile, though
somewhat sad, was incomparably
sweet. But a nose somewhat too
long, a chin a little too short, and
thick hair parted on a forehead a
little too low, made her rather unattractive
at the first glance, and
perhaps caused the absurd notion I
shall soon have occasion to refer to.
But all who knew Livia regarded
her as an angel of goodness, and
forgot the defects of her face.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gina!</q> she hurriedly exclaimed,
as soon as she could speak, <q>my
dear little Gina! Mario has returned,
and is coming up to see you. Listen
to me,</q> embracing me as she
continued. <q>I think he means to
tell you something that will distress
you&mdash;something I wish you
could remain for ever ignorant of.
But it is useless. He is determined
you shall know it, and, after all,
it may be as well. Only, <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>carina</foreign>,
promise to be calm. If he scolds
you, or speaks in his usual severe
way, do not answer him. Control
yourself. Let him go on, Gina
mia! I beg of you. No matter if
he distresses you for a moment; he
will soon go away, and I will console
you....</q>
</p>

<p>
I had no time to answer these incoherent
supplications, for at that
very instant I heard my brother's
steps in the gallery. He stopped
at my door, and, finding it fastened,
gave a low knock.
</p>

<p>
<q>You need not worry,</q> I whispered
to Livia. <q>Remain here,
<pb n='336'/><anchor id='Pg336'/>
and I will do as you wish, I assure
you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Livia embraced me once more,
and then opened the door. Mario
entered. I advanced to greet him,
and then stopped with surprise at
seeing him so pale and altered.
He looked as if he had been ill
also. Neither of us spoke for a moment,
for he likewise seemed to be
astonished at my appearance. He
must, indeed, have found me greatly
changed since he last saw me. I
had grown so tall during my illness
that my face was nearly on a level
with his, and the long black dress
I wore made me appear even taller
than I really was. I had lost the
freshness of my complexion. The
thick, fair hair of which I had been
so proud no longer shaded my face,
but was drawn back from my forehead,
and confined under a black
net. He had no reason now to
chide me for too much attention
to my appearance. He could not
make any cutting jests about my
hair, as he used to when I arranged
it like a crown on my brow, or left
it in long curls at the caprice of the
wind, according to the whim of my
vanity. He had left me a child&mdash;a
child wilful and full of freaks,
whom he only noticed in order to
correct for some fault. He found
me a young lady, whose sad, distressed,
and somewhat austere look
seemed the very reverse of the picture
left in his memory. He seemed
affected to find me so changed,
and held out his hand with a cordiality
much more affectionate than
usual. Then, after a moment's silence,
he said with a kindness he
had never before manifested:
</p>

<p>
<q>You have passed through a
great trial, my poor Ginevra. I
have felt for you, and participated
in your grief, I assure you.</q>
</p>

<p>
I was touched by these words,
and was about to reply, when he resumed:
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, you have suffered, I see;
but it seems also to have been a
great benefit to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
My heart was ready to burst, and
I at once drew myself up: <q>Benefit
to lose my mother! O Mario!
how can you say so?</q>
</p>

<p>
He frowned. <q>I do not mean
in that sense, Ginevra, as you must
be aware. But perhaps I am mistaken,</q>
he continued, resuming his
ordinary tone, which I only remembered
too well. <q>It may be you
have only changed exteriorly. I
hope it is otherwise, my dear sister,
and that your childish vanity
and foolish coquetry....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mario!</q> murmured Livia in
a beseeching tone, scarcely raising
her eyes from her work. This
exclamation escaped her almost
involuntarily; for she knew better
than any one else that the least reply
only acted as a stimulant when
he was inclined to be ill-humored
or angry. Therefore this slight
interruption only served to make
him continue in a louder tone.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, it is possible her coquettish
disposition may not be overcome,
and it would not be right to spare
it. I am only acting as a friend by
speaking plainly about the misfortunes
it has caused.</q>
</p>

<p>
O merciful heavens!...
Did he know my fearful secret, and
was he about to tell me what I
dreaded more than anything else
in the world to hear? My heart
throbbed violently, but I breathed
once more when he added:
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank God, Ginevra, in the
midst of your tears, for having
taken your mother out of the world
without the least suspicion of your
behavior.</q>
</p>

<p>
Though these words allayed my
chief anxiety, they seemed far more
<pb n='337'/><anchor id='Pg337'/>
insulting than I merited. A flush
rose to my cheeks, and I haughtily
drew up my head, as I replied:
<q>I never concealed anything in my
life from my mother, Mario. And
now she is gone, who alone had the
right to admonish me, it belongs to
my father, and not to you, I beg
you to remember, my dear brother.</q>
</p>

<p>
I sat down and leaned my head
against my hand, that he might not
perceive the heart-felt anguish he
had caused me. I was by no means
prepared for what followed.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are mistaken, my charming
little sister,</q> he said in a cool, ironical
tone, <q>and it is well to tell you,
as you seem to be ignorant of it,
that when young ladies play a
game that endangers their reputation
and the honor of the name
they bear, they often oblige their
brothers to take a part in it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding my folly and
defects, I was really nothing but a
child at that time, and his words
conveyed no definite meaning to
my mind. I turned around and
looked him in the face with an air
of surprise that showed I did not
comprehend him. The eyes that
met mine were no longer full of
mockery, but sad and stern.
</p>

<p>
<q>Look at that, sister,</q> he said
in a grave tone, throwing on the
table a small paper package that
was sealed. <q>The contents of that
paper may recall a circumstance
you seem to have forgotten, and
perhaps make you understand my
meaning.</q>
</p>

<p>
I hesitated a moment. I was
afraid without knowing why. But
finally I took up the paper, and
tore open the wrapper. A withered
flower fell out, which I gazed
at with surprise, but without the
slightest recollection.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you not recognize it?</q>
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nevertheless, that flower came
from your hands.</q>
</p>

<p>
I shuddered. He continued in
the bitterest tone:
</p>

<p>
<q>It is true it was then red, ...
red as the blood that had to be
shed to restore it to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
The horror with which I was
filled at these words struck me
dumb. I clasped my icy hands,
and turned deadly pale, without
the power of uttering a word!
Livia sprang from her seat.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mario, you have no heart, or
soul, or mercy! Go away. It was
not your place to tell her about this
misfortune.</q>
</p>

<p>
But Mario, excited as usual by
contradiction, continued without
any circumlocution, and even more
violently than before.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no. It is better for
Ginevra to learn the truth from my
lips; for I am the only person
that dares tell her the real state of
the case. And I will do it without
any disguise, for it may cure her.
She shall listen to what I have to
say. It will do her good. And I
shall conceal nothing....</q>
</p>

<p>
I will not repeat the words that
fell from his lips like a torrent of
fire!... Besides, I can only recall
their import. All I can remember
is that they met the very evening
of that fatal day&mdash;where and how I
do not recollect. Flavio was talking
to several other young men, and,
without observing Mario's presence,
insolently mentioned my name.
My brother snatched the carnation
from his button-hole. The next
day the encounter took place....
</p>

<p>
I felt ready to drop with fright
and horror. <q>Oh!</q> I said in a
stifled voice, <q>can it be that my
brother has killed Flavio Aldini
with his own hand? O my God.
my God! My punishment is
greater than I deserve!</q>
</p>

<pb n='338'/><anchor id='Pg338'/>

<p>
<q>No, no,</q> he eagerly replied,
<q>it was not I who....</q> He stopped,
... and then continued in a
calmer tone, but somewhat bitterly:
</p>

<p>
<q>Compose yourself, dear sister;
it was my blood alone that was
shed in this encounter.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>May God forgive me!</q> I shudderingly
exclaimed with the fervent,
sincere piety I always manifested
with the simplicity of childhood.
<q>And may he forgive you, too,
Mario; for you likewise have committed
a deed forbidden by God.</q>
</p>

<p>
A faint smile hovered on Mario's
lips, but it immediately gave way
to a graver expression; for notwithstanding
his defects, he was by no
means disposed to be impious.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forbidden by God! That is
true, Ginevra; but it is, I would
hope, a deed he sometimes excuses,
especially when the person insulted
gets the worst of the encounter.</q>
</p>

<p>
As he said this, he put his hand
to his breast, as if suffering from pain.
I was again struck with his extreme
paleness, as well as other traces of
illness in his altered appearance,
and was penetrated with shame and
remorse. A feeling more akin to
affection than I had ever felt for
him sprang up in my heart, and I
said to him humbly:
</p>

<p>
<q>Mario, you have done right to
be plain with me, and I thank you.
What you have said will, I trust,
effect my entire cure. At any rate,
you have done your duty.</q>
</p>

<p>
He had never known me to yield
to him before. I had always revolted
against his ill-humor and
harshness, whether just or not, and
sometimes replied with an impertinence
that justified his resentment.
He was touched at seeing
me in this new attitude, and, for
the first time in his life, clasped
me in his arms and kissed me with
real affection. He then left the
room, making a sign for Livia to
follow him. She did so, but returned
in a few minutes. Tears were
in her eyes, and her lips were
slightly tremulous&mdash;a sure indication
in her of some sudden and
profound emotion.
</p>

<p>
Mario had not told me every
thing. His anger had died away,
and he left it for kinder lips than
his to communicate the rest.
</p>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>V.</head>

<p>
The affliction and repentance
that so speedily followed the brief
moment when I saw Flavio Aldini
for the last time seemed to have
effaced the transient impression
produced at our only meeting, as
a stream, suddenly swelled by a
storm, washes away every trace left
on the sand. I should have met
him again with indifference, and
perhaps even with aversion; for he
would have been always associated
with the first misfortune and first
remorse of my life. Nevertheless,
when Livia, after considerable hesitation,
uttered the words, <q><hi rend='italic'>Flavio
Aldini is dead</hi>,</q> a cry almost of
despair escaped from my lips; and
the horrible thought at once occurred
to me that Mario had deceived
me&mdash;that he was the murderer,
and that this flower, a thousand
times abhorred, had cost the life
of him who had obtained it through
my vanity and thoughtlessness!...
</p>

<p>
The terrible lesson I had already
received was not, however, to be
carried to such an extent; but it
was some minutes before I could
be convinced of it. Livia herself
had some difficulty in clearly relating
the account she was charged
<pb n='339'/><anchor id='Pg339'/>
with. At length I comprehended
that Flavio, while pursuing a successful
career of pleasure, was no
less careful to improve every opportunity
of repairing the inroads
made on his fortune. Among
these was the proposal to marry a
wealthy heiress, which he acceded
to without any scruple. But though
he thus triumphed over a large
number of suitors by means of his
good looks and captivating manners,
it was, in his eyes, only a
lucky bargain and another light
vow. He had been engaged only
a few days, and the marriage was
about to be publicly announced,
when he met me at the ball. The
sight of a new young face, and especially
the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>naïve</foreign> inexperience of
a girl it would be easy to dazzle,
inspired the wish to try his power
once more. But he had been followed
to the ball-room, and watched,
by one of the unsuccessful suitors
of the beautiful heiress. His
encounter with Mario a few days
after confirmed his rival's suspicions,
and afforded him a pretext
for gratifying his hatred and jealousy.
Consequently, when Flavio,
after leaving Mario wounded on
the field, returned to the villa he
occupied at a short distance from
Messina, he found a new opponent
to bring him to an account for his
faithlessness to his betrothed, on
the plea of a distant relationship
that gave him the right to declare
himself her champion. In this
second duel, fortune was adverse
to Flavio. He lived several weeks,
however, and had only died that
very morning from the effects of
his wounds!... The news had
just arrived.... And this was
what Livia had been commissioned
to tell me of....
</p>

<p>
If it is true that our souls are like
precious stones that only reveal all
their brilliancy after much cutting
and polishing, it is certain that for
both the first blow must be the
most trying.... My soul, over
which my mother had watched, and
which she said was dearer to her
than her own life, or even than
mine, was now undergoing this painful
process; or, rather, had undergone
it. But during the last hour,
it was no longer the knife, but fire,
that had been applied to my bleeding
heart!
</p>

<p>
Though I had no direct cause for
self-reproach concerning this new
catastrophe, as I at first feared, I
did not feel myself wholly irresponsible.
This was sufficient to deepen
the solemn gravity of my reflections,
in which I remained absorbed so
long&mdash;motionless and silent&mdash;that
poor Livia was seriously alarmed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Speak to me, Gina, I implore
you. Oh! why, tell me why, <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>carina</foreign>,
you have kept all this secret from
your poor sister? Who could have
dreamed you loved this unfortunate
man; that you loved any one unbeknown
to us all? Could we imagine
such a thing possible? You
know, dear child, I have never
found fault with you, and I will not
now. So tell me if it is true that
you eluded the vigilance of your
mother and Ottavia, in order to
meet Flavio in the garden? Was
it there you gave him the flower
you wore in your hair? And is it
true that more than once....</q>
</p>

<p>
Excessive surprise completely
roused me from my stupor, and I
eagerly interrupted her with a face
as red as fire:
</p>

<p>
<q>Never! never! never!...</q> I
exclaimed in a tone that would have
convinced the most incredulous, for
it had the indubitable accent of
truth. <q>I did not love Flavio Aldini,
and I never met him alone in
my life.</q>
</p>

<pb n='340'/><anchor id='Pg340'/>

<p>
Livia, in her turn, looked at me
with astonishment. <q>Did not love
him? Never met him alone?
Never gave him a bouquet or a
single flower?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will tell you the truth, Livia:
once, and then I did not speak to
him, I threw him from a distance
the carnation I wore in my hair.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Once? From a distance? Ah!
then tell me when and where you
did it?</q>
</p>

<p>
I made no reply. A thousand
thoughts flashed across my mind
with the rapidity of lightning....
It was evident that, by some wonderful
chance, no one knew exactly
what had taken place. A vague
story had been circulated, founded
on Flavio's exaggerated boasts.
My father, brother, and sister had
accepted this version&mdash;so far from
the truth&mdash;without understanding
the real extent of that which had
been alleged against me. I felt
that they considered me guiltier
than I really was. And yet I would
not have undeceived them for anything
in the world. They judged
me more severely than I deserved,
but of what consequence was it?
Was I not sufficiently culpable to
accept this injustice with humility?
Was it not enough, without complaining
of anything else, to be at
last assured that my secret was
safe with my mother in heaven?
Ought I not rather to bear all their
reproaches without a murmur?
There was only one that would
have overwhelmed me, and that I
was spared. All others were easy
to bear, and, moreover, were merited
by what they were ignorant of,
if not by what they supposed true.
</p>

<p>
Livia patiently waited for me to
break my long silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>You know I am incapable of
telling you an untruth,</q> I said to
her at last.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, and therefore I always believe
you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, then, I implore you to
believe me now, Livia, without
asking me anything more. And,
moreover,</q> I added in a supplicating
tone, <q>do not repeat what I
have just told you, and make no effort
to justify me to any one.</q>
</p>

<p>
My good sister looked at me attentively
for a moment, and then
gently drew my head against her
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<q>Poor Gina!</q> she said. <q>It
shall be as you wish. I believe
everything you say, and love you
too well to annoy you with any
more questions.</q>
</p>

<p>
Livia knew me thoroughly; for,
notwithstanding her apparent simplicity,
she had an eye that could
read one's soul. She saw the sincerity
and repentance of mine, and
read in my pale face and distressed
look the extent of my sufferings,
and her kind heart melted.... I
was, indeed, very young to experience
such a variety of emotions,
and was still too weak to endure
them. The habit of duelling, so
unfortunately prevalent in Sicily,
had, of course, accustomed me more
than would have been the case anywhere
else to occurrences similar
to that I had just heard about.
But to have my name connected
with so fatal an affair; to feel that I
was the cause of the blood shed in
one of these encounters, and that the
other had resulted in the tragical end
of one who had flashed for an instant
across my path, like one of those
meteors that are the ominous forerunners
of misfortune and death,
... was more than my young
heart and feeble frame could endure.
Livia perceived it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>carina</foreign>,</q> she said, <q>lean
against me. You need rest.</q>
</p>

<p>
I attempted to make my way to
<pb n='341'/><anchor id='Pg341'/>
an old sofa, covered with red damask,
at the other end of the vast
and scantily-furnished room; but I
had no sooner risen than my
strength failed me, and I was
obliged to lean against a table to
keep myself from falling. Livia
hastened to procure some cold
water, with which she sprinkled my
face. I soon recovered, but was
still pale and agitated when Ottavia
came in. She had left me
quite well an hour before, and,
finding me now in such a state,
she exclaimed with mingled impatience
and alarm as she advanced:
<q>Good heavens! what has happened
to her? She was so well this
morning.</q>... And giving Livia
a furtive, distrustful glance, she extended
the index and little finger
of her hand, closing all the others;
turning around as she made this
gesture, the meaning of which is
only too well known in our country.<note place='foot'>It is well known that the people of Southern
Italy think they can, by this gesture, avert the
effects of the <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>jettatura</foreign>, or evil eye, which they
attribute to some persons.</note>
This was done so quickly
that I hoped I was the only one to
perceive it.
</p>

<p>
<q>How foolish!</q> I angrily exclaimed
to Ottavia, seizing her hand
and covering it with mine. <q>Are
you going to treat me always as if
I were an invalid or an old woman?
<emph>Thanks to Livia</emph></q>&mdash;and I emphasized
these words&mdash;<q>I have entirely
recovered.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ottavia, half angry, half sorry,
was about to go away; but Livia
made a sign for her to remain, and,
pressing my hand as she embraced
me once more, left the room without
uttering a word.
</p>

<head>VI.</head>

<p>
The little incident I have just
related will doubtless excite some
astonishment, and be regarded as
scarcely confirming what I have
said before about Ottavia's piety
and good sense. But whoever has
lived in the southern part of Italy
knows there are hundreds of people
in that region whose education, and
even religious instruction, are in
no way deficient, and who, nevertheless,
are not exempt from the
singular superstition I have just
referred to.
</p>

<p>
I leave it to the erudite to prove
that Magna Græcia derived it from
classical Greece, the mother country;
that remote antiquity made
use of the same absurd gesture to
avert the effects of what it was still
more absurd to believe; and that
in those days, as well as now, people
multiplied this very sign under the
form of protective amulets&mdash;not
only as jewels to be worn, but in
the objects that surrounded them.
I likewise leave to them the task
of explaining why this evil has resisted
the influence of time and the
progress of civilization, as well as
the spirit of Christianity. All that
can be said, it seems to me, is that
in those regions this superstition
takes the place of all those that
abound in the North of Europe,
and from which Italy is exempt.
For instance, we do not hear people
there, as in Ireland, Scotland, and
Sweden, talk of strange, weird apparitions,
fairies, or malign spirits,
under the name of bogies or banshees.
They are not afraid, as in
Russia, of meeting people clothed
in black, of the number thirteen,
and a thousand other absurd notions
which Catholicism has condemned
without being able to eradicate,
and which Protestantism has
<pb n='342'/><anchor id='Pg342'/>
been much more powerless against.
Nor are the ruins, as in Germany,
associated with wild legends or
haunted by spirits. But, to make
up for all this, the jettatura holds
there its baleful sway. Though
frequently ridiculed, it is feared
more than any one is willing to admit;
and there is no one, even
among the most reasonable, who
would suffer this dreaded epithet
to be applied to himself, or any one
he loved, without manifesting his
displeasure. It would be impossible
to account for the cause of this
prejudicial notion in individual
cases, or explain why this fearful
term is sometimes applied to men
of special merit, and women who
are young, lovely, and amiable, as
well as to those whom a pretext is
wanted to avoid, or whose appearance
has something repugnant.
Sometimes it is sufficient that a
person has accidentally witnessed
some misfortune, and, if the same
thing is known to occur again, the
word escapes from the lips, flies
from mouth to mouth, and the foolish
prejudice is established. This
had been the case with poor Livia.
An accident once happened to me
in my childhood when she was with
me; shortly after, she was present
when another occurred to one of
our young friends; and a third
time, she happened, in one of her
charitable rounds, to be in the
house of a poor man at the time of
his death. This was spoken of at
first as a mere jest; but it gradually
became a source of mortification
and humiliation to her, though
none of us were ever allowed to
make the least allusion to it in her
presence. The repeated troubles
of the past few weeks had disturbed
the faithful Ottavia's equilibrium
and good sense to such an unusual
degree that when she found me, pale
and agitated, leaning on my sister's
shoulder, the first thought inspired
by her terror caused her instantly
to make this involuntary gesture.
</p>

<p>
I was so vexed at this occurrence
that for a moment I forgot everything
else. I felt angry with Ottavia,
and threw myself on the old
sofa without speaking, in a fit of
mingled sorrow and displeasure.
</p>

<p>
I had always been fond of Livia,
and now all the repressed and pent-up
tenderness of my heart was
poured out on her. She seemed to
be the only person in the world
that still loved me&mdash;the only one
that stood between me and what
appeared like a great void. Yes,
my mother was right in what she
said about the great necessity of
my nature. As a flower dies, deprived
of the sun, so without affection
I should soon cease to exist.
I placed no reliance on the durability
of that which my brother had
just manifested. As to my father,
his love seemed extinct in comparison
with that of former times. And
now that I knew the reason of his
coldness and severity, I had no
hope of overcoming them; for I felt
sure he would less readily excuse
the truth, were it revealed to him,
than the error which had caused
such a change in his manner.
</p>

<p>
Therefore for any one to wound
the feelings of Livia, my darling
sister, my indulgent and faithful
friend, was at this time like piercing
my very heart. I remained
with my head on the cushions of
the old sofa, while Ottavia was
bustling about the chamber, as if
trying to divert my attention from
what had taken place. At last she
approached and tried to get hold
of my hand. I withdrew it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, dear signorina,</q> she
said, <q>forgive your poor old Ottavia.
I did wrong.</q>
</p>

<pb n='343'/><anchor id='Pg343'/>

<p>
<q>Yes, very wrong, Ottavia,</q> I
replied in a tone almost severe.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know it, and feel as if I were
listening to the blessed spirit of
Donna Bianca herself when I hear
you and see you! You resemble
her so much, signorina!...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, Ottavia, what would she
say to you, if she had been present?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She would tell me that my fear
of the jettatura is both foolish and
wrong; and that is only what I
know myself, what I believe and
realize when I am on my knees before
God!... Oh! at such times
I really feel that his will alone is
everywhere accomplished; I only
love that holy will; I am afraid of
nothing, because I am convinced
that will must prevail. And yet,
after all, ... when my dear signorina
seems to be in danger, or I
imagine some one is going to bring
her ill-luck....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ottavia!... Ottavia!</q>... I
cried, suddenly interrupting her
with an outburst that almost frightened
her, <q>it is I, it is I, and
not she, who bring ill-luck to all I
approach....</q>
</p>

<p>
I burst into tears as I spoke.
This sudden return upon myself
effaced, with the mobility of youth,
the impression previously received,
and brought back, to my confusion
and remorse, all the reality of the
present.
</p>

<p>
Ottavia, like the rest, had been
told of my supposed fault, and was
ignorant of what I had really done;
but she was by no means in a
mood now to add any reproaches
to those I had already received
from my brother. On the contrary,
she tried to soothe me, not
by any direct reply, but by speaking
of that which she could talk
best about. I had always been
more or less piously inclined from
my earliest childhood. How could
it be otherwise under the excellent
influence that had hitherto been
the life of my life?... This piety
did not obliterate my faults, but it
existed in spite of them, and was
to exist through all the perils reserved
for me in the future. But
it was, if I may so speak, intermittent.
Sometimes it grew dormant,
if not absolutely extinct; at other
times it was kindled to a lively and
ardent degree. Therefore I frequently
recited my catechism with
indifference and <foreign rend='italic'>ennui</foreign>; but when it
was explained by Ottavia in her
peculiar way; when she spoke of
the sacraments, or dwelt on the life
and sufferings of our Saviour, and
more especially on the life to come,
I was filled with delight. The
loveliness of the natural world
around me seemed to assume an
additional charm; and when I considered
that this was only a faint
image of a far more beautiful realm,
I longed at once to exchange this
life for the other....
</p>

<p>
It was by such means the good
Ottavia now gently endeavored to
divert me, by speaking of God, of
heaven, and various other sacred
topics. By degrees she came
back to more indifferent subjects,
and finally to Livia, promising to
make her forget the mortification
she had experienced, and almost
persuading me she had not perceived
what had taken place.
</p>

<p>
I allowed her to talk on in this
way without interruption until her
somewhat monotonous tone produced
a drowsiness that was beneficial
to my over-excited nerves.
As soon as she saw my eyes grow
heavy, she placed one of the large
sofa-cushions under my head, closed
the window-shutters to exclude the
dazzling light, and then, after remaining
beside me till she was persuaded
<pb n='344'/><anchor id='Pg344'/>
I was fast asleep, softly left
the chamber.
</p>

<p>
I was not, however, asleep. But
my attitude and the profound silence
and solitude of the room were
very soothing, and I remained a
long time absorbed in a thousand
complex thoughts. Long years
have passed away since that day,
and other and more dangerous
temptations have assailed me, but I
have never forgotten the reflections
of that hour. My vanity had been
for ever shattered like the congealed
surface of some deep lake by some
sudden blow. It had not really
been a part of my inner nature, but
rather on the surface, and therefore
not the most dangerous trait of my
character. During the remainder
of my life, I can only recall a single
hour&mdash;and <emph>only one!</emph> ... when it
again blinded me.... But that
hour was long after the one of which
I have been speaking. At this time
I could say with assurance that
Mario's wish was fulfilled&mdash;that I
was effectually and radically cured
of my vanity. Associated with so
many poignant recollections, it had
become horrible in my eyes.
</p>

<p>
My health was somewhat affected
by the agitation I had undergone,
and I took advantage of this to remain
several days in my room, only
leaving it to take the air on the terrace.
I only saw my father for a
moment, morning and night. The
remainder of the day I passed with
Livia. Whether she had forgotten
what had distressed me so much, or
it was owing to her self-control, or
she really had not noticed it, it was
impossible to tell from her manner,
and I finally persuaded myself it
was as I hoped.
</p>

<p>
Livia, in spite of her amiable
disposition, had great firmness of
character. She never allowed herself
to be induced to tell anything
she wished to conceal, or to do
what was forbidden by others or by
her own judgment. But what especially
characterized her was her
self-forgetfulness. This did not
strike me at that time. When one
is only fifteen years of age, one receives
impressions without defining
them: one is repelled or attracted
by certain natures without being
able to analyze them. But in looking
back, not only over the events
of my past life, but what transpired
in the inner folds of my conscience,
I clearly see the difference between
my sister's nature and mine. From
her very childhood she had lived a
life of self-forgetfulness (sublime
and simple way to heights but little
known!), regardless of her own
tastes and inclinations, and even
of her own sufferings. Whereas, I
was constantly endeavoring to fathom
the workings of my heart
and soul and mind, and to find food
for them, as one tries to appease
one's hunger and thirst when importunate.
Not but that I was capable
of forgetting myself, and, so
to speak, of being absorbed in the
heart of another, as I had been in
that of my mother, but solely on the
condition of being to that other, in
return, the object of an infinite predilection;
... for this word of such
vast import does not seem to express
more than my heart craved. But
in spite of this difference, or rather
on the very account of it, Livia and
I were always at ease with each
other, and it was not without regret
I was at last obliged to resume my
usual life. I regretted this the more
because it had been regulated by
my father in a way that indicated
only too plainly how much he distrusted
me. Nevertheless, I submitted
with humility and docility
to this unaccustomed <emph>surveillance</emph>,
the cause of which was so evident.
</p>

<pb n='345'/><anchor id='Pg345'/>

<p>
I was only released from it during
the early hours of the day, which I
spent in my chamber with Livia.
I was not allowed to go into the
garden, except under Ottavia's escort;
and I was not permitted to
leave the house, unless accompanied
by my father or Mario. All the
rest of my time I passed in my father's
cabinet, where he had a table
placed for me near his own. There,
for hours together, I read, wrote,
or worked, varying my occupations
according to my own tastes, but
without any other liberty. To have
passed my days in this way beside
my father would have been delightful
once; but now, though he
was often kind and affectionate,
there was a certain gravity in his
affection that made me feel I was
the object of unjust suspicion, and
tortured me beyond expression.
But I submitted to this torture
without a murmur, acknowledging,
as I did so, that it was only a merited
chastisement.
</p>

<p>
This cabinet was like a vast hall
in form, and, like all the other
rooms of that old palace, grand in
its proportions, but only furnished
with what was absolutely essential.
One side of the apartment was
entirely lined with shelves filled
with books and papers, and at each
extremity stood a row of arm-chairs.
In the middle of the room, opposite
two large windows, was my father's
writing-table, near which was mine.
Between the windows hung a large
painting, which was the only ornament
in the room; but, to compensate
for this, the garden could
be seen, and further off, beyond
the verdure of the orange-trees,
stretched the blue outline of the
sea.
</p>

<p>
My father received many of his
friends and clients in the morning,
but seldom admitted any of them
into the room we occupied. A
servant half opened the door to
announce the visitors' names, and
my father went into the adjoining
room to receive them. It was only
on special occasions he gave orders
for any one to be admitted where
we were.
</p>

<p>
During the long hours I was
thus left alone, I sometimes
busily employed my time, but more
frequently remained with my arms
folded, plunged in a profound
reverie. At such times I always
avoided looking at the large painting
that hung on the opposite panel
between the two windows.
This was a fine copy of Herodias'
Daughter, by Guido, the original
of which I afterwards saw in the
Palazzo Corsini, at Rome. The
sweet, charming face of the girl
who is holding with a smile the
bleeding head of S. John had a
kind of fascination for me. It
seemed like the personification of
vanity in a new form, giddy and
thoughtless in its course and fatal
in its results, and often inspired me
with many silent, gloomy reflections....
I preferred looking at the
foliage of the orange-trees in the garden
below, or gazing into the blue,
illimitable heavens above. I often
amused myself, likewise, before a
cage, prettily painted and gilded,
that hung in one of the windows, and
contained a bird whose company was
a great diversion in the life of disguised
punishment I was condemned to.
This bird, whose melody surpassed
that of the nightingale in sweetness
and power, was one of those called
at Sorrento, where they are chiefly
found, the <foreign rend='italic'>passero solitario</foreign>. I was
so fond of its sweet music that my
father had allowed me to hang the
cage here, and more than once in
the day I climbed up on a bench
in the embrasure of the window to
<pb n='346'/><anchor id='Pg346'/>
see there was no lack of the singularly
copious and solid food which
this bird of angelic notes daily requires.
</p>

<p>
One day, while I was thus perched
at a considerable height from
the floor, the door opened much
wider than usual, and the old
servant that announced the visitors
said with a certain emphasis: <q>His
Excellency the Duca di Valenzano.</q>
</p>

<p>
My first thought was to descend
from the post I occupied; but before
I had time to do so, the visitor entered
the room, and stood regarding
me with an air of surprise. My
father rose to meet so unexpected
a client; but the latter held out his
hand to aid me in my descent, and
followed me with his eyes, without
speaking, as I hastily regained my
usual seat, blushing with confusion.
My father conducted him to the
other end of the room, where stood
the row of arm-chairs, and both
took seats. During the long conversation
that followed, I could
only hear the tones of their voices
as they rose and fell. Sometimes my
father's predominated, and at other
times the deep, sonorous voice of
his visitor. I saw it was a question
of business, for my father rose
several times to search for different
papers among the books arranged
on the shelves of the library.
Finally the conversation ended,
and the new client proceeded towards
the door. But when he arrived
opposite the cage where my
bird was singing, he said: <q>Really,
one's ears are charmed here no less
than one's eyes. It seems more
like a palace of fairies than a rendezvous
for all the contentions of
Sicily....</q>
</p>

<p>
He was then standing directly
before me.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don Fabrizio,</q> continued he,
<q>is not this your daughter, Donna
Ginevra, of whom I have so often
heard? Do me the favor of presenting
me to her.</q>
</p>

<p>
My father's face assumed a severe,
dissatisfied expression, and mine
was covered with a livelier blush
than before. <q>Heard of me so
often?</q> Alas! he had probably
heard me spoken unfavorably of!
Perhaps this was the very thought
that clouded my father's brow.
Nevertheless, after a moment's
hesitation, he said: <q>Rise, Ginevra,
and pay your respects to the
Duca di Valenzano.</q>
</p>

<p>
I rose, but without uttering a
word; for I was disconcerted by the
fixed, scrutinizing eye that seemed
trying to read my face. I lowered
my eyes, without being able to distinguish
the features of this new
acquaintance. I only remarked
that he was tall, and had a noble
air, in spite of his peculiar garb,
that made him look more like a
travelling artist than a person of
high rank.

<p>
We left Rome in a storm of thunder
and lightning. The rain poured
in large, cold drops, pattering
against the windows of the railway
carriage, and adding considerably
to the feelings of gloom and apprehension
with which we thought of
Rome&mdash;as Rome is now. When
should we visit the Eternal City
again? And would the veil of sadness
which now falls on all that is
dear and sacred to the Catholic be
raised once more in our time?
Mary was very silent for some
hours of our long journey; and
while I, with my habitual curiosity,
was peering through the rain-washed
window to discover the beauties
of the glorious country through
which we were rushing, she lay
back with closed eyes, absorbed in
thought; while Frank, with a fixed
frown on his face, was reading and
rustling, and finally crumpling up,
in paroxysms of anger, the numerous
Italian papers that he had
bought by handfuls at the station.
Presently Mary opened her eyes
once more, and condescended to
recognize the great fact that we
were travelling further and further
to the glorious South. I do not
think I felt less intensely than my
sister the sorrow that attends all
reflection on the present condition
of the great centre of Christendom
and the position of the Father of
the faithful. But my grief is apt to
take another form from that of
Mary's or Frank's. Mary grows
silent and outwardly calm. Frank
becomes gloomy. I am more irritable;
and irritability leads to activity.
My mind was working with
an incessant rapidity, and the impulse
to catch sight once more of
every shred that could carry me
back to happier times, and recall
once more the memories of the
past, kept me straining my eyes to
get a glimpse of Albano, where we
had spent a long, happy summer
when the Holy Father was at Castel
Gandolfo. Should I catch sight of
Lavinia, Æneas' own city, the object
of so many excursions in those
happy days? Should I see those
hills covered with chestnuts, bare
of leaves now, beneath whose shade
I had so often rested? Even Velletri,
though not in itself a specially
interesting place, had the charm
of association. I remembered how
I had gone to spend a long day
there, and had wandered to the
gates of some private house with a
large garden. I had stood looking
through the iron bars on a little
paradise, but, as usual in Italy, a
paradise in disorder. Stone vases
stood on a balustrade, filled with
bright flowers, but also with weeds.
The fertile valley lay below, and
beyond the blue and purple mountains
rose in tiers one above
another, with soft, violet shadows
<pb n='348'/><anchor id='Pg348'/>
and dim blue mists; and here and
there a peak of rugged rock, on
which the sun struck bright and
keen. A long avenue of shady
plane-trees was to my right. A
solitary peasant drove his mule,
with balanced panniers and pointed
ears like two notes of admiration
against the sky, far as my eye could
reach down the green distance. I
longed to wander on; to follow the
flickering lights along that silent
road, and know that it would lead
me out to the Pontine Marshes,
with the rugged Abruzzi beyond.
Here, too, rests the body of
Hyacinthe Mariscotti, a Franciscan
nun, who died in 1640, and whose
life, less known out of Italy than it
deserves, is one of the most marvellous
in its union of great graces and
great sufferings.
</p>

<p>
The rain pelted hard; the lightning
made me, from time to time,
shrink back suddenly; but still I
strained my eyes to catch sight of
the shifting scene, and allowed memories
to reawaken and imagination
to throw its glamour over the
past and the future.
</p>

<p>
Many of the stations along this
road are at some distance from the
towns whose name they bear;
and this, of course, diminishes a
little the interest of the journey.
For instance, Aquino, the birthplace
of the great father of the church,
S. Thomas Aquinas, is about a
mile off. Near here we were, for a
time, to take leave of Frank. He
had made up his mind to visit the
cradle of the great saint before
proceeding to Monte Casino, where
he had made arrangements to
spend at least a week. Our readers
are no doubt well aware that
Monte Casino is no longer what it
was. Its glories have been shorn
by the present government, as the
rays of the sun are shorn by the
twilight. There are comparatively
very few monks of the order of
S. Benedict still allowed to reside
there. Amongst them, however,
Frank had formed a real friendship;
and for a month previous, at
least, Mary and I had heard him
descanting upon all the charms
that he was to find in that wonderful
retreat of learning and sanctity.
Partly to tease him, and partly to
be revenged for the fact that I
must be for ever excluded, I generally
replied to his enthusiasm by
making a wry face and uttering the
words, <q>Kid, rancid oil, and garlic.</q>
Then he would toss back
that tiresome stray lock which is
always trying to shade his beautiful
violet eyes, and reply, with a
smile, <q>Oh! I shall not mind.</q> The
train stops a very short time at San
Germano, the station for the Monastery
of Monte Casino, and we had a
hurried leave-taking. I was endeavoring
to collect a few of his
newspapers, which I thought he
had not half read, and put them
into his hand as he left the carriage.
<q>No, no, dear Jane. Do
you think I would pollute those
sacred walls by carrying there all that
blasphemous stuff.</q> And he leapt
out just as we began to move on.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Mary!</q> I exclaimed, <q>how
dreadful it would be, if Frank were
to become a Benedictine monk.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What else do you want him to
do?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, live at home, of course,
as an English country gentleman
should do, marry, and bring up a
son to rule after him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What a thorough conservative
you are, Jane!</q> said Mary with
a smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am not so sure of that. I
have a dash of the liberal in
me at times. But I do love the
dirty acres; and I like to see them
<pb n='349'/><anchor id='Pg349'/>
going down from father to son
without a break.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are right there. It is
that permanence which is the
back-bone of England. I do not
believe in the lasting stability
of any country where there is
a perpetual and ever-recurring
division of property. What a
man <emph>has</emph> should always survive
what a man <emph>is</emph>, in a sufficiently
substantial form to make the cradle
of a future destiny. And
where no one is sure of inheriting
a large fortune with the large leisure
that it secures, it tends to make
all men equally mercenary. There
should always be a class apart who
have no need to fret about making
money, but can afford to spend it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But what if they do not spend
it well?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is an answer which in
one shape or another you may
make to the laying down of
any principle. What if it be abused?
It does not prove the falsity
of the principle, but only once
more calls to mind the truism that
everything is open to abuse.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I suppose you think there are so
many objects on which wealth may
be advantageously expended that it
is well to have an hereditary body
whose business it is to do so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; and I would certainly include
the cultivation of hot-house
grapes, and the elysium of fat porkers
who are washed and combed
twice a week. It is every man's
business to produce the best he can
of whatever he has in hand, including
pineapples and pigs.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well done, Mary. You are a
worse conservative than I am. But
do you really think that modern
civilization, as it is called, has its
uses?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By modern civilization, Jane,
I conclude you really mean material
improvements. Civilization
is a term which is so misused
that it has become hardly safe to
use it at all. It ought to mean
something much higher than increased
railway facilities, more looking-glasses
and buhl, hundreds of
daily newspapers, and a French
cook.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! of course. Civilization
ought to mean the intellectual
and spiritual development of mankind
from out of the rough block
of his animal nature and his uneducated
mind. If you add to this
the refinement which self-respect
and a perpetual inner consciousness
of a Being greater and higher than
ourselves, keeping all the man's
actions in harmony with himself
and with a higher law, you have a
really civilized man as distinct
from a savage.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is not a bad description
of what civilization ought to be.
But that is very different from
the idea most people have in their
minds when they use the term.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In point of fact, Mary, I mean
material progress. How far is it useful?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How people would stare at
you, Jane, for that query!&mdash;people
who think there is nothing more glorious
than to have invented a new
machine or a fresh adjunct to luxury.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, those are just the people
who would not the least
know what I meant by my implied
doubts about the value of material
progress. But you know what I
mean and why I question its nature
and deprecate its increase.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is a difficult question to solve.
But I have long since come to the
conclusion that there is never any
very great and generally diffused
advance made by mankind in any
one direction without its having
<pb n='350'/><anchor id='Pg350'/>
some definite purpose in the Eternal
Mind for the ultimate good
of his creation. The progress of
science is only second in importance
to the progress of religion;
and after these two comes the progress
of the useful arts, which are
the offspring of science, and often
seem only to pander to luxury, but
are really subsidiary aids in that
march, in the accomplishment of
which man is to fulfil his destiny of
possessing the earth and filling it.
Mankind is in no way benefited by
the discovery, for instance, of a
new perfume, whereby some silly
woman may add to the already
exaggerated expenses of her toilet;
but the process by which that
perfume has been produced is, in
itself, of the utmost value, and
exhibits mechanical invention and
scientific principles that are of the
last importance to mankind. The
perfume is an accident&mdash;a little of
the golden dust scattered by the
wheels of material progress.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Just so; and dust, albeit golden,
is not a good atmosphere to breathe
in.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Decidedly not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then do you think, dear Mary,
that material progress, or what we
generally call improvements, conduces,
on the whole, to human happiness?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! there lies the really difficult
question, and one which I have
again and again striven to answer
satisfactorily to myself. Happiness
is a term generally used to cover
more than it has any right to do.
There is only one real happiness,
and that is what man finds in himself,
in union with his God. That
happiness is positive, and there is
no other positive. We begin it
here, but with great drawbacks
and frequent interruptions. We
complete it in the light of glory.
But outside that, hanging on to the
skirts and fringes of real happiness,
there are contentment, pleasure,
ease, and last, but not least, comfort.
No one can impart happiness,
pure and simple, to another. The
nearest approach to doing so is in
a reciprocal affection. But God
alone can satisfy the soul of man.
What we can confer on others and
on ourselves are various degrees
of those lesser goods which I have
enumerated. Now, all these enter
into the general plan of God's dealings
with his creatures. The animal
world is susceptible of them
in its degree, and we ourselves
in a far higher degree. As they
enter into the general scheme, I am
at liberty to conclude, not only
from my own sensations, which
might delude me, but from that
very fact, that they are of very
great importance, and that everything
which augments the sum of
them is a blessing. They are the
ore out of which we coin our charities
to others. They are therefore
essentially God's gifts, to be given
by us again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know what you mean, Mary.
I shall never forget the pleasure I
had in taking one of your air-cushions
to that poor woman at T&mdash;&mdash;,
who was dying of cancer, and to
whom the slightest pressure of even
an ordinary pillow was so painful.
Now, air-cushions are a comparatively
modern invention. Dear mother
used to say no one ever heard
of mackintoshes and gutta-percha
in her day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Jane, nor yet of lucifer
matches. It was terrible work to
have to nurse the sick through the
night, with a flint and steel and tinder
as the only way of striking a
light. I think I see now my old
nurse, with her large frilled night-cap,
hammering away for what
<pb n='351'/><anchor id='Pg351'/>
seemed to us children a good three
minutes, because the rush-light had
gone out, and baby was crying. I
can remember I had for that flint
and steel very much the same
feelings an Indian has for his fetish.
I used to wonder how the flint hid
the fire in its cold bosom, and why
sometimes it seemed to require so
many more persuasive knocks than
at others before it gave out its
sparks. But for the matter of that,
as a child I had secretly embraced
the earliest form of religion, the
<emph>animism</emph> of the lower races of
savages&mdash;and I lent a soul to all
inanimate, and even all inorganic,
matter. I believe, if we could but
find it out, all children do so more
or less. The external world is so
wonderful to them that they vaguely
imagine a personality and a consciousness
to exist in everything.
There is not a little girl who does
not, in her heart, believe that her
doll is something more than wax
and sawdust; and I would not
give much for her, if she did not.
The exuberance of faith leads to
an exuberance of tenderness; and
the girl who believes in her doll has
the germ of a good mother in her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You seemed just now to attach
a great importance to comfort,
Mary. I am surprised at that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It arises, in a measure, from my
own personal experience. Besides
which, comfort may mean almost
anything; for it is generally whatever
we are used to. I remember
so well, years ago, when the sorrows
of my life first threatened to overpower
me, how thankfully I felt the
warm, soft arms of mere outward
well-being so closely round me.
To me they were no more than
comforts, because all my life I had
been used to them. To others
they would have seemed luxuries.
When I used to go up to London
alone to my father's house, and
find all ready to my hand&mdash;well-appointed
servants, large, warm
rooms, and a good table, with
nothing of meanness, or sparing, or
pinching in the unextravagant but
perfectly organized home that was
open to me&mdash;I used often to lean
back in my easy-chair, and say to
myself, <q>I am very unhappy;
but, thank God, I am not uncomfortable!</q>
Later on, you know, it
was not so. I was a Catholic, and
doors that had been open to me
before were closed for ever. Then
came the time for discomfort. If I
wanted to go to London, I had to
go to a lodging. The furniture
was shabby and dirty; the fires
smoked; the food was badly
cooked. I drove about in hired
vehicles, perished with cold, and
shaken to death. I knew I was in
no way degraded by it all; but it
was new and painfully strange to
me, and I <emph>felt</emph> degraded by an
amount of discomforts which in my
youth I had never approached. It
did not, in itself, make me unhappy,
but it added a thousandfold to the
suffering from real causes for unhappiness.
I used to say they were
the splinters of my cross, though
not my cross itself. Ever since
then, I never see a person in sorrow
without being anxious to make
them at least comfortable. There
is nothing, you see, approaching to
asceticism in my view, dear Jane;
but, at any rate, one is not bound to
be ascetic for others.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mary and I were sitting side by
side in the railway-carriage, I having
come from my seat opposite in
order the better to hear. But now
I returned to my old place, just as
we paused at the station of Caserta,
and saw the largest palace in Europe,
now empty and almost deserted,
not far off.
</p>

<pb n='352'/><anchor id='Pg352'/>

<p>
The great object in our visit to
Naples was to be as near as possible
to our friends, the Vernons.
We were to go first to a hotel, and
then look out for a villa at Posilippo,
near the one occupied by themselves,
which was called Casinelli,
from the family of that name to
whom it belonged. We had written
to Ida Vernon to beg she would
choose our hotel and our rooms.
She had lodged us at a very comfortable
<foreign rend='italic'>pension</foreign> on the Chiaja, and
wrote us word we must, on reaching
the station at 10 o'clock at night,
look out for their servant, Monica;
and that she would wear a red
handkerchief pinned across, gold
earrings, and a blue skirt. We
were not to expect the universal
black hair and eyes of the Italian
woman, as hers were soft brown.
The station is very large and very
badly lighted. But as soon as I
got out, I ran to the grating&mdash;a
high iron railing, behind which
stood the crowd of people, friends,
servants, porters, and mere lookers-on,
all pushing and squeezing to
catch sight of those they expected
by the train. I soon made out the
blue skirt, and red kerchief, and the
amiable, smiling face of Monica.
She welcomed us exactly as if we
had been old friends, and that it
was a personal pleasure to herself
that we had arrived. She had
brought a carriage for us the size
of a small house, but which refused
(through the coachman) to take luggage.
That was to follow in another
kind of conveyance immediately
after us. Every sort of injunction
was given as to its destination,
and, persuaded all was right,
we rumbled over the large flags of
the streets of Naples to the far end
of the Chiaja, where we were to
lodge. There were flowers in our
room and a note from Ida; and
the next morning we were to meet,
after a separation of seven years.
Meanwhile, our <foreign rend='italic'>impedimenta</foreign> was
slowly grinding its way past our
door, up the steep hill of Strada
Nuova, on to Posilippo, where our
friends reside&mdash;a good twenty minutes
from our abode&mdash;down the hill,
through the vineyard, and up to
the door of the Villa Casinelli,
where, arriving about midnight, they
thundered and thumped till the
tired Monica had donned once
more the blue skirt, while Lucia
was screaming that there were robbers.
Ida came forth in a warm
wrapper; Elizabeth's tall figure
was draped in white; Helen peeped
out of the half-open door; and the
good Padre Cataldo, their chaplain,
in <foreign rend='italic'>beretta</foreign> and <foreign rend='italic'>soutane</foreign>, had to emerge
from his little sanctum, at the
furthest end of the long, narrow
house, before peace could be restored,
and our mountain of huge
black trunks, portmanteaus, and
leather bags could be induced to
retrace their needless steps, climb
again that zig-zag road up the steep
tufa rock, and reach us, worn out
with waiting and feverish with impatience
for night-gear, at about
one o'clock in the morning.
</p>

<p>
Brilliant sunshine, streaming into
the room the next day, woke us up
to the sense of the joyous, bounding
life of these delicious climes.
O noisy Naples! what clamorous
cries, what vibrating shouts, what
shrill feminine voices, fill thy glaring
streets through the livelong day
and far into the unrestful night.
The horses neigh as they do not
neigh in any more tranquil climes.
The usually silent ass is here a garrulous
animal. The dogs bark and
snarl in a dialect special to Naples.
The women scream like cockatoos,
and never address each other in
lower tones than as if shouting
<pb n='353'/><anchor id='Pg353'/>
a word of command on board a
man-of-war in a gale of wind.
Their habits are not conversational,
but <hi rend='italic'>scream</hi>ational; and the most cordial
civility is communicated like a
threat, while an affectionate compliment
is conveyed in sounds sufficient
to startle the most supine into
lively attention. Young girls hiss
and squeal; infants bellow and
roar. It is noise, noise, all day
long; and over all a remorseless
sunshine on white, glaring pavements
of flag-stones a quarter of a
yard square and more, like the
pavement of the ancient Romans,
such as we still see it in the Via
Sacra near the Colosseum, and
which resounds to the metallic
tread of donkey, mule, and horse,
or to the softer, shuffling pit-a-pat
of the herds of bearded goats that
traverse the city at early morn and
eventide.
</p>

<p>
Mary's bed-room opened into a
large <foreign rend='italic'>loggia</foreign> full of flowers&mdash;geraniums,
petunias, and carnations in
full blossom, though it was only
the month of March; but so had
they blossomed more or less all
through the winter. A few orange-trees
in tubs were there with golden
fruit and star-like flowers. Then
the blue sky and the bluer bay!
Yes, it was the plenitude of life
that one only knows in the South,
with the delicious sense of the
pleasure of mere existence, which
tempts one to adopt the <foreign rend='italic'>dolce far
niente</foreign>, and makes living and breathing
seem a full accomplishment of
the day's duties.
</p>

<p>
Ida and Elizabeth Vernon came
early to carry us off to Posilippo;
first to call on Mrs. Vernon at Villa
Casinelli, and then to decide on
a lodging as near to them as possible.
We found them living in a
house whose foundations are washed
by the sea, and commanding a
view of wonderful beauty. The
descent from the main road was too
steep for any carriage, winding in
and out through vines and fig-trees,
oranges and Japanese medlars, ending
in a closely-knit avenue of the
white mulberry, which in the summer
makes a dense shade.
</p>

<p>
Our friends wanted us to take
the villa next to theirs, if only the
proprietor, a poor and proud <foreign rend='italic'>marchese</foreign>,
would let it to us. We went
over to look at it, but came away
in disgust. There was scarcely
any furniture, and none that would
have satisfied even the most modest
requirements. I do not remember
seeing any beds, although it is certain
the family come there from
time to time for a few days. I
asked Ida where they slept, and
she pointed to some roomy sofas
and wide divans, on which had
been flung the ashes and the ends of
cigars, as the probable resting-place
of the proprietors. We could only
shake our heads in horrified astonishment,
and think what a lovely
place might be made of this quaint
old house. It stands partly on
the rock and partly on arcades,
through which the sea comes rushing
when the waves are high, but
where, when it is calm, you may sit
on silver sands or on the stone
steps that lead down from the
house and the upper terraced gardens.
We had been so fascinated
by the appearance of this residence,
which looks outside like the fragment
of an old feudal castle, and
inside is bright with sunshine and
the glorious view it commands, that
we had requested Padre Cataldo
to write and ask the terms before
we had gone over it. On our return
from doing so, shocked at the
dirt and disorder we had witnessed,
we were amused to find a
magniloquent reply to the effect
<pb n='354'/><anchor id='Pg354'/>
that the titled owner would <q>condescend</q>
to let us his dwelling for
(and here he named an exorbitant
price), solely out of an amiable desire
to make himself agreeable; and
that he would call the following
morning to receive the ten weeks'
rent in advance! We finally decided
on the villa next but one to that of
our friends&mdash;the Villa R&mdash;&mdash; R&mdash;&mdash;.
We did not require more than one
floor of the house. The rest was
occupied by the family, and had a
second entrance. We came into
our part straight from the Strada
Nuova, down a few steps, and in at
a large folding door flanked by a
Stone seat and two vases with
huge aloes. We had a lovely view
of the bay in front, a little garden
on a sloping bank on one side, full
of oranges and lemons, now in
full fruit and flower; a <foreign rend='italic'>loggia</foreign>&mdash;that
great desideratum of an Italian
house&mdash;and a view of Naples and
Mount Vesuvius. On our return to
our apartments, we were met by the
woman who attends upon us, telling
us that Ann was in her room
with a bad headache. Little did
we guess what had befallen her!
We went in to see what was the
matter, and found her flung upon
the bed, with her clothes on, in
a profound stupor. In vain we
called her and shook her; we could
not rouse her. The landlady presently
came and told us that an hour
previous poor Ann had been brought
home by a <foreign rend='italic'>gendarme</foreign> in a carriage;
that she was unable to walk up-stairs
without assistance, and seemed
completely dazed when spoken to.
The <foreign rend='italic'>gendarme</foreign> said he had noticed
a young person sitting on a bench
in the Villa Reale, the long, narrow
garden which runs for a mile
along the Chiaja by the sea-shore;
that she looked extremely ill; and
that, noticing she had valuables
about her (alluding to her watch and
chain), he had asked her address,
put her into a carriage, and brought
her home. It was a mercy he had
done so. The Neapolitan police
are not always so honest. But our
dismay was increased when at
length, having awakened her, she
did not know any of us. She kept
entreating Mary, who held her in
her arms, to take her back to her
own Mrs. Gordon, her good Mrs.
Gordon. In vain Mary replied,
<q>But I am Mrs. Gordon, Ann.
Look at me; don't you know me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no; you look something like
her, but you have not her voice. Oh!
where is she. Where is Miss Jane,
and where is Lulu?</q>
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, Lulu, Mary's dog,
was in her room, and the probability
was that, though she failed to know
us, she would recognize Mary's Lulu
from any other Lulu. I flew to fetch
the little animal, and threw it into her
arms, to poor Lulu's great astonishment.
It succeeded perfectly. She
knew the dog, and thus recovered
her memory of the faces around
her, and her conviction that she
was in her own room. Evidently
she had a vague horror that she
might have been taken to the wrong
house, and that she had awakened
among strangers. When she had
entirely recovered herself, we found
that no trace of what had happened
to her remained on her memory
from the moment that she entered
the Villa Reale; yet she was
found more than half way down it!
She must have wandered on partially
insensible; and it is a blessing
that, when the <foreign rend='italic'>gendarme</foreign> found
her, she had enough consciousness
left to give the right address. She
had already been out in the morning,
and a second walk in the hot
sun had been too much for her. It
was a sun-stroke; and strangers
<pb n='355'/><anchor id='Pg355'/>
are more subject to such accidents
than persons who have become
habituated to the climate. It was,
however, long before Ann really
shook off the effects of gratifying
her over-curiosity to visit the beauties
of Naples on first arriving.
</p>

<p>
In a very short time, we were comfortably
settled at Villa R&mdash;&mdash;
R&mdash;&mdash;. The Vernons had arranged
everything for us with a forethought
for which we could not be too grateful.
They lent us the services of Monica
as cook, assuring us that, if we
took a Neapolitan, we should be
cheated and tormented out of our
lives. Monica was a Piedmontese,
and as good and simple-hearted a girl
as any one could wish to find. Her
economical scruples were positively
amusing. We could hardly induce
her to buy the particular articles
we desired for our dinner, because,
in her estimation, they were at too
high a price in the market; and she
would beg and entreat of us to wait
patiently a little longer until they
should have gone down. If it had
been her own money she was spending,
she would not have been so
economical; for, as we found out
later, she was always ready to lend to
those less well off than herself, and
would give away more than she
could afford. The name of the
young lad whom the Vernons engaged
to act as servant was Paolino,
a boy of eighteen, with glorious,
large brown eyes and bright complexion.
It was some time before
we taught him manners, as he had
never been in a gentleman's family
before. His father was a <foreign rend='italic'>vignaiuolo</foreign>
of the name of Camerota. He
had several sons and daughters,
some of them married. He rented
the vineyards of the <foreign rend='italic'>marchese</foreign>
whose dilapidated house we had
declined to hire, and each of his
children married from their home
with a good substantial dower and
a large <foreign rend='italic'>trousseau</foreign>. The eldest girl
had not long been a bride when we
arrived; and, after making the
acquaintance of the other members
of the family, we one day called
upon her. Their dwelling was
built against the tufa rock which
skirts the Strada Nuova. She
had three rooms, nicely furnished,
with marble tops to the chest of
drawers and the table, such as we
in England should only expect to
find in the houses of the rich, but
which here are common enough.
The bedstead was of walnut, and
the sheets like the driven snow for
whiteness. Ida, who had known
the girl for years, told us that her
<foreign rend='italic'>trousseau</foreign> contained a dozen of
every necessary article of dress and
house-linen, even to a dozen pairs
of stays!&mdash;enough to last a life-time.
There hung a crucifix at
the head of the bed, and a few
colored engravings ornamented the
walls of the sitting-room, in which
also there stood a tiny altar with a
statue of the Mater Dolorosa and
a few flowers.

<p>
The lower classes here have
what we should call strange notions
with respect to the sacrament of
marriage. It is treated as a deed
of darkness. The bride is conveyed
late in the evening, or by cock-crowing,
to church, by her mother
and a few respectable matrons.
No young girl, not even a sister, is
allowed to be present, and would
endanger her reputation were she
to appear on such an occasion.
A few days later, the bride once
more puts on her wreath, and her
veil, and her wedding-dress. All the
family and friends of both sexes
are gathered together, and the
women and men, in separate carriages,
drive fast and furious along
the Chiaja up the Strada Nuova,
<pb n='356'/><anchor id='Pg356'/>
past Posilippo, by the hour, and
finally pause at the Taberna del
Capo di Posilippo, or some other
house of entertainment, and have a
merry feast. We held this said
Taberna somewhat in horror. On
Sundays&mdash;the day on which everybody
seems to think his honor and
reputation are engaged in galloping
up hill and down dale at a
break-neck pace for the whole
afternoon&mdash;this was the chief place
of meeting; and in the lovely
starlight evenings, the returning
guests would come back with a
sadly rollicking air, hat on one side,
a long cigar in the mouth, and a leg
hanging over the side of the frail
vehicle, while the spirited little
Sardinian horse, all blood and
sinew, would fly along, with jingling
bells and bright brass harness, as
if his hoofs hardly struck the earth.
The drivers of these <foreign rend='italic'>cittadine</foreign>, as
the little hired open carriages are
called, take great pride in their
harness. The horse-collar more
resembles a yoke; and where it
meets over the horse's neck, there is
often a little brass image of the
angel guardian&mdash;a very necessary
angel, indeed, considering the pace
they go, and whose guardianship
must be severely put to the test by
the mad risks of the half-inebriated
coachmen. It is very rare to see
a Neapolitan really drunk. The
wine they take produces a light,
joyous, but brief intoxication,
which makes dare-devils of them
for the time, but soon loses its
effects, and is rarely stupefying.
It is the divine <foreign rend='italic'>inflatus</foreign> of the
Bacchus of old, and not the coarse,
heavy incapacity of the snoring
Silenus. Nevertheless, though I
have spoken so indulgently of the
Taberna del Capo di Posilippo, it
formed a not unfrequent subject
of grave rebuke and expostulation
in the discourses of our good Padre
Cataldo to his little group of listeners
in the chapel in the rock
belonging to Villa Casinelli. And
probably he knew more of its evil
influences than we did. I remember,
one Sunday afternoon, being
particularly struck by a carriage
full of merry-makers, drawn by the
most miserably thin gray mare my
eyes had ever beheld. She was
nothing but a bag of bones, and
must have reached the utmost age
that horse ever attains. I was
horrified to see so old and pitiable
an object driven so hard and fast,
and could only console myself by
thinking the gallop I then witnessed
must surely be the last. But it was
not so; far from it. Day after day,
but on Sundays especially, my Rosinante
might be seen flinging her
wild hoofs into space, amid a cloud
of dust, and generally in competition
with a beautiful, wicked-looking
black horse, sleek and well
cared for, in dazzling harness, with
red ribbons in his mane&mdash;a perfect
little devil, as he took the bit between
his teeth, and seemed to enjoy
the eagerness of his driver, albeit
the lash fell often on his sleek
and steaming flanks. I delighted
in that little black horse. But to
the last Sunday of our abode at
Posilippo poor Rosinante held her
ground. And I can see her now,
awful to behold, neither fatter nor
thinner&mdash;that she could hardly be&mdash;than
the first day, devouring the
ground beneath her, and flinging
out her skeleton leg straight from
the shoulder, so that I could hardly
see she touched the ground.
</p>

<p>
The chief amusement on Sunday
afternoons of our own humbler
friends and neighbors, the <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>vignaiuoli</foreign>,<note place='foot'>Vine-dressers.</note>
was a game of bowls by the side
<pb n='357'/><anchor id='Pg357'/>
of the road, and in front of the
wide-gaping wooden doors of the
strange dwellings cut in the rock
where the inhabitants of Posilippo
reside. Many of these are restaurants
and taverns on a small and
humble scale; and Padre Cataldo
had been making vigorous efforts,
not to discourage the game of
bowls, but to induce the men to
play in an open space near the
Villa Casinelli, and consequently
at some distance from the taverns.
Like all Italians, and chief amongst
them all, the Neapolitans are great
gamblers. The tavern-keepers encourage
this, because it promotes
their trade; and the games being
carried on in front of their caverns
(for such they really are) leads to
incessant <q>treating.</q> In this way,
what between entertaining his
friends and losing his money at
play, it often happens that the ill-advised
<foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>vignaiuolo</foreign> returns to his
home with his pockets empty;
and the next day the wife would
come in tears to tell her sorrows to
the good father. Even our Paolino
was never contented without
an hour or two at bowls on Sunday
afternoon. And we did not like to
refuse him, for we were obliged to
take him somewhat on his own
terms; and these involved a very
small sense of servitude, and a very
large one that he had put us under
something of an obligation by coming
to us at all. Had he been a
year or two older, his parents would
not have allowed him to enter service,
thinking it a degradation. But
as he was very young, and rather
restless and wanting change, it was
decided that he might be allowed to
work off a little of the exuberance
of boyhood in our service. Even
this could not have been allowed
had we not been friends of the
Vernons; but as they are adored
by all the <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>vignaiuoli</foreign> and the inhabitants
of Posilippo generally, their
request could not be overlooked.
Accordingly, Paolino, blushing and
grinning, was admitted to form one
of our household. His father told
us exactly what his son's labor was
worth to himself, and that we were
to hand over to him. It was all to
go to the making-up of Paolino's
marriage-portion. We were then
to pay the lad a little over for himself,
as pocket money. And this
was to be done with discretion;
not to prove a temptation to lavish
expenditure. This is the way in
which the marriage-portions of both
boys and girls are made up. They
work for their own parents, and the
latter put by the wages for them.
When old enough, they are at liberty
to undertake other and more profitable
work. And from time to time
there comes a windfall&mdash;a little
work to be done in addition; or a
specially good harvest, when the
parents add something of the surplus
to the portion of the girl or
boy then marriageable. There was
a deep, dark-eyed maiden, of the
ripe age of fifteen, with wayward
black locks and a furtive glance in
her liquid eyes like a startled fawn,
about whose conduct there was a
slight demur. Venturella (for such
was her name, and it struck me at the
time as of evil omen) was at heart
as innocent as a child of five. But
there was something in her shy yet
daring nature which caused a certain
uneasiness as to the fate of the
timid, impulsive girl in this evil
world. Venturella was fond of
leaning over the low parapet which
divided her father's vineyard from
the highroad; and when the brief
Italian twilight had sunk in the
shades of night, and the brilliant
stars, that seem so near in
those southern lands, had spangled
<pb n='358'/><anchor id='Pg358'/>
the dense blue heavens with their
myriad fires, Venturella would pretend
she did not hear her mother's
voice calling her to come
home. With arms crossed, she
would lean on the wall, just breast
high, and her star-like eyes would
seek their sister-stars above with
a vague, dream-like wonder. What
the stars&mdash;and perhaps even more
the moon&mdash;said to Venturella we
shall never know; but one of
them must have carried a message
to a certain youthful Franceschino,
whose hyacinthine locks clustered
low over a brow of ivory, beneath
which lay two eyes like the evening
sky Venturella was so fond of;
and whose teeth gleamed in the
soft light like the white sea-foam.
Nobody knew; and as the birds
had all long ago gone to bed, none
of them were there to whisper
tales.
</p>

<p>
Franceschino was the son of a
<foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>vignaiuolo</foreign> who lived on the Vomero,
the heights above Posilippo;
and the little stolen interviews
took place as he came back from
the city, whither he had been sent
on his father's business. From
time to time the mother wondered
what made her son so late in coming
home; and one night she
thought she would find out for herself
whether the dry bush hanging
out before the wide doors of one
of those cavernous taverns had
tempted Franceschino to try the
red wine within, and perhaps take
a hand at cards with some other
loiterers. Alas! for Venturella
when the indignant matron found
out the charm which had led to
the boy's delay. She was not likely
to hold her tongue about it.
Nor was his father, who beat and
cuffed him well; for boys of nineteen
at Posilippo will meekly bear
a cuffing from a parent, when they
would not tolerate a finger's weight
from any one else. Then came
the rage of Venturella's mother;
and spite of Padre Cataldo's having
elicited the fact that no greater
wrong had been done than a few
silly promises and one shy kiss,
all Posilippo was loud in crying,
Fie for shame! on the fawn-eyed
Venturella. At length those older
than herself and wiser than her
mother took the matter in hand.
Could nothing be done? Stern
fortune answered, Nothing. Venturella's
marriage-portion was far
from being made up. She was an
idle hussy, and only worked when
she could not help it. The rest
of the time she paddled with naked
feet in the silver sands, tempting
the tiny waves to kiss them,
or gathered scarlet poppies from
among the green corn and twisted
them in her raven hair. Worse
than all, Franceschino was equally
behindhand with his fortune;
and nineteen was too young for a
lad to marry, though fifteen was
none too soon for a Neapolitan
maiden.
</p>

<p>
There was, however, something in
the silent <foreign rend='italic'>sauvagerie</foreign> of the strange
girl which made it evident to her betters
that she could not be thwarted
with safety. There was something
deeper than words in the sudden flash
of those wild eyes when they looked
up fiercely, and then fell beneath the
long, fringed lids, and lay in shadow
like pools in some dense forest.
Venturella shrank, half angry, half
ashamed, at every breath of blame;
while her eyes grew larger and
deeper, and the round, full cheeks
became pallid and sunken.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is to be done with that
wayward girl?</q> was the ever-recurring
question among the Vernons,
who seemed to take upon their
own charitable shoulders every
<pb n='359'/><anchor id='Pg359'/>
burden that weighed upon their
numerous friends, the Posilippians.
At length a suggestion was made
that Venturella should be sent to
school far away from present associations,
where she would have
numerous girls of her own age to
divert her, and where she might
learn fine needle-work and embroidery&mdash;the
only thing, besides
paddling in the sea and weaving
wreaths of wild flowers, for which
she had ever shown any disposition.
Meanwhile, a <hi rend='italic'>dot</hi> was to be
thought of for her; not so very
much was wanted to make up the
necessary sum&mdash;about 4,500 francs.
And then, when Venturella should
be wiser and Franceschino older,
who knows but what love's young
dream may turn out true at last?
</p>

<p>
It did not take us long to get intimate
with the names and habits
of the rural population around us.
They were quite willing to receive
us as friends, and seemed to expect
a ready sympathy from us in all
their concerns. Unlike the peasants
of an English village, the best
of whom, at least amongst the women,
cultivate so little acquaintance
with each other, here everybody
knew everybody else; and though
I do not pretend to say there was
less gossiping among them, it always
struck me that there was less
of that sour ill-nature which is apt
to characterize the English cottager's
comments on her neighbors.
No doubt this arises in a greater
degree from the nature of the people
than from acquired virtue. It
is only in northern, damp climes,
like the English, that the necessary
ills of life are so heightened and
intensified by the general sense
of moral and physical discomfort
which a heavy atmosphere and a
gray sky produce. We all know
what it is to wake in the morning
with a vague sense of apprehension,
as if the post were about to bring
us a distressing letter which our imagination
foresaw. We all know
the ceaseless and unreasoning feeling
of being out of spirits which
also tempts us to be out of temper.
We are acquainted with the blue-devils,
and we are generally taciturn
and inclined to gloom. The
Italian knows nothing of this. The
very great and constantly-pervading
influence these feelings have
over our daily life is absolutely beyond
the limits of his experience,
unless, of course, he is suffering from
a deep sorrow or a real physical
malady. To the age of eighty, he
wakes in the morning with the
same sensation of joyous energy
or placid pleasure which we were
beginning to lose before we were
eight. He is passionate; but
he is not irritable. He has paroxysms
of despair, but he knows no
constant gloom. Our impatience,
our tendency to being <q>put out,</q>
are enigmas to him. The small
hindrances of every day and every
hour are less a great deal to him
than the swarms of his pestering
southern flies are to us. <foreign rend='italic'>Pazienza</foreign>
(patience) is for ever on his lips;
and it is no vain word, for patient
he is to a degree which is exasperating
to behold. When he is waiting,
he is not gnawing an invisible
bit, as we are doing, and grinding
his teeth to powder. He is simply
enjoying the being alive; and it
does not much matter to him
whether he chews the delicious cud
of existence waiting at your door
or sitting in his own home. You
may make him furiously angry;
and as likely as not he will stab
you in the back and in the dark.
But you cannot make him cross, or
fretful, or peevish, or low-spirited.
Depend upon it, if he is ever any
<pb n='360'/><anchor id='Pg360'/>
one of these things, it is high time
to call in the doctor, who probably
will declare his case already hopeless.
On the other hand, if anything&mdash;and
it may often be a trifle&mdash;thoroughly
rouses a Neapolitan, it
is fearful. It becomes a <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>rabbia</foreign> (a
rage), as they themselves express it;
and then they are blind and deaf
to reason and expostulation, and
run amuck of all that comes in
their way. It is possible that the
extraordinary violence which seizes
them is, in a measure, purely physical,
and that that also in a measure
diminishes their responsibility.
Evidently, they think so themselves.
<foreign rend='italic'>Era una rabbia</foreign><note place='foot'>It was a fit of rage.</note> is considered almost
an excuse for the worst crimes,
so long as these were committed in
the heat of passion. And probably,
in the long run, this has seriously
affected the moral sense;
so that good and reasoning people
fail to be as much horrified at some
murder committed in a brawl as
we should be. They look upon an
event of the kind almost in the
light of a mutual misfortune between
the murdered and the murderer.
It is at least certain that the
line of demarcation which separates
inward resentment from the outward
act of guilt is more easily
crossed by these children of the
sun, and does not presume the existence
of so much previous demoralization
as it would do with
us. Yet I am far from intending
to write an apology for the Neapolitan
character. There is a great
deal about them which is very
graceful and very attractive; and
when they are really good and refined,
they are most lovable. But
this is exceedingly rare. As a people,
they are venal, deceitful, mercenary,
and treacherous. But with
it all, they are exactly like children;
good or naughty, as the case may
be, but always children.

<p>
Frank not being with us, the Vernons
had undertaken to procure
for us a carriage and a pair of
horses, with a well-conducted
coachman, to hire by the month.
Indeed, had Frank been there, he
could not have done it half as well
as they did; for all these transactions
require you to be acquainted
with the current charges and with
the character of the people; and
Frank had no experience in either.
The Vernons concluded the bargain
for us with Pascarillo, the man from
whom they always hired a vehicle
when they wanted one; and a fine,
handsome-looking fellow he was,
with the reputation of being rather
a gay Lothario, but, on the whole,
an honest man as Neapolitans go.
Our carriage was delightfully roomy.
It held four with admirable ease,
and five at a pinch, together with
cloaks and cushions, luncheon and
drawing materials, whenever we
went on an excursion. In the
evening, we could close it. We
had two very fleet horses, not at
all fine-looking, and rather undersized
for the carriage, but the best
little beasts to go I ever saw. Our
coachman was a veritable son of
Jehu. He was a miserable object,
mean and despicable to look at,
diminutive, with bleared eyes, a
beardless chin, and the expression
of a low coward. But never have I
sat behind such a coachman as that.
I believe he would have taken us
up the wall of a house and down
the other side in perfect safety. It
did not signify what his horses did,
or what evident peril we got into,
he always managed quite quietly to
bring us right again without any
expression of vehemence or alarm.
Suddenly, one day, our coachman
<pb n='361'/><anchor id='Pg361'/>
vanished. An old man appeared
in his stead, and a pair of grays,
larger than the little brown horses.
We made no remark, supposing it
was an accident, and that our former
equipage would return in time.
That day we set out for the Vomero&mdash;the
height above Posilippo, covered
with beautiful villas, and commanding
a superb view, or rather
many views. The horses jibbed.
We were greatly alarmed. They
could not be got up the hill, and
we had to go home. We sent an
indignant message to Pascarillo, and
hoped it would never happen again.
But it did happen; not once nor
twice only. And then Pascarillo was
sent for in person to render an account
of himself. There he stood, six
foot two, with broad chest, a forest of
hair, and an august presence. Ida,
the universal spokeswoman, with
her fluent Italian and her determined
energy, left him in no doubt
as to her opinion of his conduct.
He heard her out silently and
calmly, and then replied that the
<foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>signorina</foreign> was quite right; he was
conscious that his conduct had
been inexcusable, and that we had
serious cause for displeasure. He
had not kept to his bargain, and
he was aware of it. It should not
happen again; and with a polite
bow, he retired. It did not happen
again. He had tried to take us in,
and he had not succeeded&mdash;just a
little speculation that had failed,
and that was all! As for any rancor
at being scolded, or any humiliation
at having to make an
apology, such sentiments did not
trouble the breast of Pascarillo for
a second. He probably only said
to himself, <q>Better luck next time.</q>
Our little horses came back, and
our impish young coachman with
them. We had never again to
complain. But the impression
made on Mary's imagination by
our coachman's face was such that
she had scruples of conscience
about Paolino being allowed to
converse with him on the coach-box.
Paolino was, therefore, seriously
informed that for a footman
to talk to the coachman when the
ladies were in the carriage was not
good manners. And from that
moment silence was maintained;
and Paolino's morals were left untainted,
as he sat, radiant in clean
white cotton gloves and a new
necktie, enjoying the delights of
drives and picnics at least as much
as the persons on whose account
they were undertaken.

<p>
In this busy world of labor,
where mankind seems exclusively
bent on the acquisition of wealth,
fame, or power, on fashion, folly,
and empty pleasures, how seldom
we pause to consider seriously the
diversity and multiplicity of the
elements of humanity by which we
are surrounded! How few, in
their headlong career after vain
desires, ask themselves if this
world were made for them alone;
if the end and object of life, the
first gift of a merciful Creator, is
merely selfish enjoyment, or whether
the social compact, as well as
the laws of God, do not require of
us to assist in every way possible
our less fortunate or more afflicted
fellow-creatures.
</p>

<p>
It requires little reflection or effort
to distinguish the favorites of
fortune&mdash;those whose lot having
been cast in pleasant places, shine
in the public regard like beings of
a superior order. Worldly success
is ever prominent, and its devotees
are always ready to court its notice
and extol its merits. To be fashionable
is to be fawned upon; to
be influential, sought after; to
wield power is to be placated.
Not so with the humble, the poor,
the ignorant, and the obscure;
the victims of physical affliction or
of moral degradation. They are
usually shunned, often despised,
and, as far as possible, contemptuously
ignored. They constitute
the outcasts of <q>society,</q> and,
when they come betwixt the wind
and its nobility, are merely objects
of contempt, barren pity, or downright
loathing. Yet these very unfortunates
comprise, even in our
own favored land, a very large and,
in an indirect sense, a potent constituent
of our population. Always
with us, no matter how much
we may attempt to separate ourselves
from them, they appeal to
us for help in the name of all we hold
sacred; and their supplications, no
matter how mutely made, if unheeded,
are certain to be followed,
even in this life, by a blight on our
souls as well as a curse to our bodies.
The heart of man becomes
hardened, the fine perception of
fraternal love and charity with
which he is naturally blessed withers
and shrivels up, and he becomes
a mere embodiment of self, an arid
isolation, in proportion as he steels
himself against the cries and sufferings
of his kind. The very ignorance
he will not help to remove,
the want and squalor he refuses to
alleviate, rise up in judgment
against him, and, developing into
crimes against life and property,
haunt his footsteps, and but too
often mark him for their prey.
</p>

<p>
As in all things else, if we want
an exemplar for our conduct in
relation to our fellow-beings, we
must look to the church. Following
the teachings of her divine
Founder, from the earliest ages she
has recognized the existence of the
vast amount of misery, poverty,
vice, and ignorance which underlies
the surface of civilization, ancient
and modern, and has used every
effort to mitigate it. While yet
the successors of S. Peter were
<pb n='363'/><anchor id='Pg363'/>
struggling with the effete though
polished paganism of the dismembered
Roman Empire, and the greater
part of Europe was enshrouded
in the darkness of barbarism, societies
of holy men and pious women
were established and sustained by
the popes and the fathers of the
church, to mitigate in some degree,
by their prayers and good works,
the evils which beset society in its
earliest transition state. The principal
evils to be combated at that
time were the ferocity of heathenism
outside the confined limits of
Christendom, and, within, the mental
obscurity of the barbaric catechumens
and neophytes. Physical
destitution, in our signification of
the term, was but little known beyond
the limits of a few great
cities; for men's wants were few
and easily supplied before the increase
of population and the unequal
distribution of property became
general in the Old World.
Therefore we find that the monks
and nuns of the IVth century, and
for many hundreds of years afterwards,
devoted themselves mainly
to preaching and teaching, to the
multiplication of copies of the Holy
Scriptures, and to praying for the
conversion of mankind. Thus the
order founded by S. Basil, Archbishop
of Cæsarea, in Cappadocia,
Asia Minor, <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> 362, and that of
S. Benedict, Abbot of Norcia, in
Italy, in 529, and the numerous
cenobitic communities which sprang
from them, all more or less strictly
observing the rules laid down
by those great lights of the church,
considered prayer, humility, and
obedience the essential principles
of their foundation.
</p>

<p>
Congregations of women devoted
to the worship of God, prayer, and
poverty were coeval with, if not anterior
to, those of men; for we find that
S. Anthony, in the latter part of the
IIId century, placed his sister in a
<q>house of virgins,</q> of which she
afterwards became abbess; and that
on Christmas day, 352, in S. Peter's
Church in Rome, Pope Liberius conferred
the habit and veil on Marcellina,
enjoining on her a life of
mortification and prayer. A little
later, mention is made of SS. Marcella,
Lea, and Paula as distinguished
Roman women who forsook the
world, and spent their remaining
life in prayer and good works; the
latter especially, who, with her
daughter, built a hospital at Bethlehem,
erected a monastery for S.
Jerome and his monks, and founded
in Palestine three convents for
female recluses, of which she took
personal charge. S. Basil found
many such convents in existence,
and established several more within
his jurisdiction, one of which was
presided over by his sister Macrina,
at Pontus. S. Chrysostom, Archbishop
of Constantinople, up to
407, writes that in Egypt the congregations
of women were as numerous
as the monasteries; and S.
Augustine, Bishop of Hippo (396-430),
built a convent of nuns, of
which his sister was superior, giving
it, in 423, a written rule, still followed
by the religious who bear his name.
Four years after, S. Benedict founded
his monastery at Monte Casino,
the rules of which, having been
approved by Gregory the Great, in
595, have been very generally
adopted by many religious bodies
of men and women in Europe and
America.
</p>

<p>
At first these religious institutions
were confined to Italy and
the East; but as the light of the
faith gradually extended over Europe,
religious houses were multiplied;
and though for a long time each
convent was governed by its own
<pb n='364'/><anchor id='Pg364'/>
inmates, and followed the ancient
rules, modified in many instances
by peculiar circumstances, it was
eventually found judicious to form
them into distinct orders or congregations,
in which all the establishments
of a particular foundation
were governed by a general
head or superior. The strict requirements
of prayer, humility, and
obedience were still observed; but
to these were added the education
of the children of the poor, alms-giving,
and other acts of external
devotion. Wherever a church was
built, a monastery planted, or a
number of people gathered together
to worship God, there was generally
to be found a convent, wherein
the ailing might find relief; the
afflicted, consolation; and the
ignorant of the female sex, enlightenment.
There the young whose
parents were scarcely out of the
slough of barbarism were taught
their catechism and the beautiful
prayers and litanies of the church,
as well as to weave, spin, and all
the other duties of a civilized housewife.
While the clergy, secular
and regular, went among the adults,
preaching, instructing, and baptizing,
holy women were near at hand
to pray for the success of their
efforts, and to show, by their gentle
charities and meek demeanor, the
loveliness and beneficence of the
Christian religion.
</p>

<p>
One of the greatest glories of the
Catholic Church is that she, and
she alone, freed woman from the
grossest slavery, and placed her in
her proper sphere of usefulness
and influence. By the sacrament
of marriage, woman was made the
honored equal of man; by her
commandments and precepts, the
church guarded her liberty and her
purity, exalted her authority in the
family, and recognized in her, even
in death, the loving protectress of
her offspring. But the church did
more than all this. She gave to
woman a part in her divine mission,
a share in the most glorious task
ever allotted to humanity&mdash;the propagation
of the law of the Most
High; and the dispensation of his
mercies and benevolence. We are
not surprised, then, to learn that in
past ages, <q>when faith was young,</q>
the most gifted and high-born of their
sex in every Christian land, daughters
of nobles and princes, abandoning
all the fascinations of the world,
even those of royalty itself, were to
be found eager to take part in the
great work of religion, and consecrate
their lives to prayer, penance,
and charity, for the sake of
the poor and helpless.
</p>

<p>
Such humility and implicit faith
in the goodness of God could not
have been unavailing; and we who
now enjoy the blessings of true morality,
with the refinements and
graces of true civilization, seldom
cast a thought back to the days of
semi-barbarism among our forefathers,
when the only light that illumined
the gloom of the outer
world proceeded from the lamp of
the sanctuary, and the only asylum
open to the affectionate and modest
soul of woman was the humble
convent, where she could surround
herself with the innocent and unstained
children of both sexes,
and teach them the way of salvation.
Beyond those sacred enclosures,
in bygone days, were little
but passion, grossness, and self-indulgence;
while within reigned
peace, delicacy, and that knowledge
which is justly called the beginning
of wisdom. The world at length
commences to acknowledge the incomparable
services of the monks
and doctors, the penmen and
preachers of the so-called dark ages;
<pb n='365'/><anchor id='Pg365'/>
but who shall count up the debt of
gratitude we owe to the thousands
upon thousands of holy women who,
spurning every earthly allurement,
abandoning home, friends, and
country, have sought, generation
after generation, to win an eternal
reward by unceasing prayer and
continuous acts of benevolence?
Europe is still, as in the past, enjoying
the benefits of the labors of
her pious daughters; India, China,
and the furthest confines of the
eastern hemisphere are reaping the
advantages of the missionary efforts
of the good nuns and Sisters; but
America seems destined to be in
the future the field whereon the full
effulgence of God's goodness is to
be made manifest in the persons
of his chosen handmaids.
</p>

<p>
To us especially the presence of
so many pious and educated women
is of incalculable advantage.
The Catholic body in the United
States has to combat a much more
insidious and dangerous foe than
was ever arrayed against the
church, even in her darkest days
of persecution. Then Christianity
had only to shatter the idol of imperial
Rome, already tottering to
its base; now we have to fight
against what may be termed civilized
paganism, energetic, unscrupulous,
and worldly-wise, which
aims at mere sensuous enjoyments,
cultivates the intellect at the expense
of the soul, and even attempts
to use the very evidences of God's
works as a justification for their
contempt of his law, and as argument
against his existence itself.
At the worst, the rude pagan of
Northern and Western Europe had
a belief in a superior Being, and an
acknowledged, innate dependence
on his will; but the fashionable
sceptic of to-day, the learned
doubter of our schools and academies,
believes in nothing but himself,
and obeys his own whims as
his highest rule of morality. It is
a melancholy fact, but none the
less true, that, according to official
authority, nearly one-half of the
people of this country, male and
female, practically believe in no
form of religion whatever. Disgusted
at the perpetual wranglings
and disagreements of the sects in
the name of Christianity; trained
into mere cultivated animals by a
system of public tuition which ignores
God, or recognizes his existence
only to ridicule and travesty
his word; and freed from all the
restraints which the church so
wisely throws around her children
from their earliest infancy, is it
wonderful that the majority of the
youth of this nation should grow
up in the actual deification of their
own prejudices and passions?
With so many instances daily and
hourly presented to our eyes, are
we to be surprised that persons
thus reared should be so active in
creating a public opinion among us
which is not Catholic, nor even
Protestant, but simply and absolutely
heathenish, without the refinement
of the ancient Greeks to
soften its grossness, or the pride
of the Roman to save it from cupidity
and dishonor?
</p>

<p>
How all-important is it, then, to
parents to be able to find schools
wherein their children&mdash;those loved
ones whom they have been instrumental
in bringing into the world,
and for whose eternal welfare they
are responsible&mdash;will be cared for
and instructed, taught habits of industry
as well as accomplishments,
and in which bands of zealous,
educated, and religious women are
ever ready to plant and nurture
the seeds of virtue in their hearts,
while shielding their young minds
<pb n='366'/><anchor id='Pg366'/>
from even the shadow of contamination.
Such guardians of the
female youth can only be found
in the nunneries, convents, and
schools of the Catholic Church.
There their lives are wholly and
exclusively devoted to works of
benevolence, of which the religious
instruction of the ignorant is by no
means the least. The world for
them has neither cares nor attractions;
they move, live, and have
their being in an atmosphere of
order, prayer, and tranquillity, their
very appearance being in itself a
homily of obedience and cheerful
reliance on the goodness of their
Maker.
</p>

<p>
Even though the educational establishments
of the nuns and Sisters
are in their infancy, there are few
parents who need deprive their
children of the advantages to be
gained only in them. A quarter
of a century ago, we could only
boast of sixty-six such institutions,
while now we have nearly four hundred
academies alone. What excuse,
therefore, is there for a piously-inclined
mother or a discriminating
father to imperil the happiness and
faith of her or his children by sending
them to secular schools where
the training they receive is worse
than artificial? In the convents
they can be taught every accomplishment
that befits a young lady,
no matter how high her station in
life, without being made the shallow
creature, the mere puppet of
fashion, which we find so often
<q>turned out</q> by the modern secular
school-mistresses of our time;
without heart, feeling, and, we
might almost say, with no fixed perception
of right and wrong.
</p>

<p>
Then we have two hundred and
forty select schools, or an average
of four for each diocese, attended
by boarders or those living with their
relations. These differ from the
academies only in degree, being intended
for the benefit of children
whose position in life does not demand
the same elaborate mental
culture, or whose school-days are
necessarily short. Still, they receive
the same attention, and are
subjected to precisely similar moral
influences, as the others. But the
poor&mdash;those whose parents are unable
to pay for their education&mdash;are
they to have none of the advantages
so freely accorded their
wealthy neighbors? Must they be
thrust into the tainted atmosphere
of our public schools, and left to
shift for themselves? Not so.
The poor have ever been the primary
objects of the good Sisters'
solicitude; and though they count
their academies by hundreds, the
number of their free schools, parish,
orphan, and industrial, may be
reckoned by thousands, and the
pupils by myriads.
</p>

<p>
In the Diocese of New York there
are forty-six of these female schools,
with over twenty thousand children,
whose tuition is gratuitous, besides
some three thousand inmates
of orphan asylums and other charitable
institutions for juveniles. In
the Philadelphia diocese there are
thirty-five Sisters' free schools, containing
nearly ten thousand scholars,
in addition to the orphans. In
Cincinnati, where the school system
has been brought to a state of
great efficiency, the proportion of
the attendants to the Catholic population
is much greater. We have
no means of ascertaining the total
number of pupils in the entire
country; but if we take the three
dioceses above mentioned as a
criterion, it will be found that in the
United States there are nearly
three hundred thousand girls daily
receiving at the hands of the Sisters
<pb n='367'/><anchor id='Pg367'/>
of various congregations a
free, thorough, and practical Catholic
education. The expense
alone of this great work of charity,
if not performed without compensation,
would be, judging from the
cost of the public schools of New
York, at least eight millions of
dollars annually. If we add to the
number of girls in the free schools
the fifty or sixty thousand pupils
in the six hundred and forty academies
and select schools, we will
find that about three hundred and
fifty thousand female children are,
in this year of grace 1874, under
the more than maternal care of the
religious of the Catholic Church.
</p>

<p>
Who can estimate the immense
amount of good which is accomplished
in this manner? Who
can measure the beneficent effects
to the country produced by
these institutions of learning, which
annually send to their homes so
many thousands of children to
gladden the hearts of fond parents,
not so much by their varied
acquirements, as by their gentleness
of disposition and unaffected
piety? If we cannot gauge the
merits of the Sisters by what we
see before us, how much less capable
are we of estimating the reward
which their long years of devotion
will receive from Him who said of
little children, <q>Of such is the kingdom
of heaven.</q>
</p>

<p>
As to the efficiency of the nuns
and Sisters as teachers of the young
people of their own sex, there is
scarcely a second opinion, even
among non-Catholics. Many Protestants
and unbelievers, while professing
little or no religion themselves,
but who would not see their
fair daughters follow their example,
are careful to place them under the
charge of the daughters of the
church, well knowing that, while
their minds will be amply stored
with useful and elegant knowledge,
their impressionable hearts will be
guarded against the follies and sins
of the world. If all the communities
in the country&mdash;in number
about forty-five&mdash;were to devote
their entire labor alone to this
great work of education, what a
benediction would they deserve
from untold millions!
</p>

<p>
But they do not stop here.
They go much further, and, with
some few exceptions, their charity
takes a far wider range. There are
the poor waifs, left deserted on the
highways, to be rescued from impending
death and nursed into
consciousness; the orphan, who
has been deprived of its natural
guardians, to be cared for; the unfortunate
pariah of her sex, to be
consoled and encouraged to resume
the path of virtue; the jails, where
lie the agents of passion and crime,
to be visited; the aged and infirm
to be taken by the hand, and led
down the slope of life with tender
solicitude. Again, the deaf, the blind,
the insane, the wounded, the sick,
and even the incurable, are, according
to their several needs, objects of
unremitting attention. No evil is so
deep-seated, no affliction so bitter,
no disease, whether of the mind or
of the body, so loathsome, that the
holy women of the church, with
God's assistance, cannot assuage or
cure.
</p>

<p>
To teach children is doubtless
a responsible and laborious occupation,
but nevertheless not without
attractions; but to walk day and
night the wards of a hospital, and
breathe the dire contagion of disease,
or, in the reformatory, to have
the ear filled with the blasphemies
and ribaldries learned in the lowest
dens of vice, are surely trials to
appall the stoutest heart, and to
<pb n='368'/><anchor id='Pg368'/>
test to the very utmost the constancy
and zeal of delicately-nurtured
women. Yet the capacious
bosom of the church has room
enough, has rest and shelter, for all
classes of unfortunates. In the sixty-two
dioceses and vicariates into
which the United States is divided,
there are nearly three hundred
foundling, orphan, deaf, blind, and
insane asylums, reformatories, protectories,
industrial institutions,
homes for the aged, houses of the Sisters
of the Poor, as well as infirmaries
and hospitals; the former numbering
over two hundred, and the latter
about ninety, or, collectively, an average
of five charitable institutions
for each ecclesiastical division.
</p>

<p>
What a load of human misery is
thus presented to the eye and
committed to the relief of the indefatigable
followers of Christ!
Who can imagine that has not experienced
it the daily round of
toil, of watching, and solicitude
which constantly awaits the footsteps
of the gentle Sister, as she goes
among her helpless clients in the
foundling asylum, listens to the
tale of woe and crime from the
still youthful lips of the repentant
Magdalene, or comforts the outcast
of his kind at the very foot of the
scaffold. Watch how lovingly she
hushes the deserted babe or the
scarcely less pitiable orphan to
sleep; how kindly she takes the hand
so long stained by contact with the
vicious and the guilty into her
own soft palm, and breathes words
of comfort and encouragement
into ears long used only to curses
and vile speech; how deftly she
smoothes the pillow of the sick, and
smiles on the second childishness
of her <foreign rend='italic'>protégés</foreign>, the aged and infirm
poor. At her approach, the
suffering child forgets its pains and
stretches forth its little arms for
her aid; the hospital loses half its
<foreign rend='italic'>ennui</foreign> and gloom, and even the condemned
cell is illumined by a ray
of sunlight when she enters it. In
fact, wherever there is poverty,
sickness, or suffering of any kind,
there is the place for the devoted
Sister, and there, in truth, she
becomes <q>a ministering angel.</q>
</p>

<p>
The distribution of these asylums
and hospitals is another interesting
feature in their capacity for general
usefulness. In dioceses having an
estimated Catholic population of
over one hundred thousand, they
may be thus classified: In Buffalo
there is one to every 8,000
Catholics; in Cleveland, St. Louis,
and Louisville, one to 13,000; in
San Francisco, one to 15,000; Albany,
one to 18,000; in Pittsburg,
Cincinnati, New York, Brooklyn,
and Philadelphia, one to 23,000;
Newark, Alton, and St. Paul, one to
25,000; Boston, one to 30,000;
Milwaukee, one to 40,000; Chicago,
one to 45,000; Galveston and
Providence, one to 60,000; Hartford,
one to 80,000; and in Springfield,
one to every 150,000. Of the
less populous dioceses, Oregon has
1, Burlington 1, Columbus 2, Covington
3, Erie 1, Fort Wayne 3,
Grass Valley 3, Mobile 3, Monterey
and Los Angeles 5, Nashville
2, Natchez 2, Natchitoches 3,
Nesqually 4, Portland 2, Richmond
3, Rochester 5, Santa Fé 2,
Savannah 3, Vincennes 4, Wheeling
2, Wilmington 1, Kansas 2,
Nebraska 1, Charleston 2. Green
Bay, Harrisburg, La Crosse, Little
Rock, Ogdensburg, Arizona, Colorado,
Idaho, and North Carolina,
all small dioceses or sparsely-settled
vicariates, have none.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to give anything
like an approximate report of the
vast number of persons of all ages
and sexes who find relief, advice,
<pb n='369'/><anchor id='Pg369'/>
and protection in these asylums
and hospitals; for we are not aware
that there is in existence any
general or full returns from one-half
of the charitable institutions
scattered so broadcast over the
country. We can therefore only
attempt to form an estimate of the
whole by taking the statistics
nearest us. For example, in this
diocese there are 572 girls and
very young boys in the female
protectory, 1,297 in seven orphan
asylums, 546 penitents in the House
of the Good Shepherd; while in one
of the four city hospitals, S. Vincent's,
950 patients were received
during last year. In Brooklyn
there are 1,041 orphans, 208 penitents,
420 patients in two hospitals,
in addition to nearly 3,000 externs
who received medical and surgical
attendance, and 229 old men and
women under the charge of the
Little Sisters of the Poor.
</p>

<p>
The care of these charitable institutions
is not confined to any
particular community, but, according
to locality or peculiar circumstances,
falls to the lot of different
congregations. Thus of the asylums,
5 per cent. are under the
charge of the Sisters of Notre
Dame; 14 per cent. under the Sisters
of Mercy; 34 per cent. under
the Sisters of Charity; 8-½
per cent. under the Sisters of the
Good Shepherd; 6 per cent. under
the Little Sisters of the Poor; 2-½
per cent. each under the Sisters
of Providence, Holy Cross, Sacred
Heart, S. Teresa, and S. Dominic;
5-½ per cent. under the Sisters of
S. Francis; 10 per cent. under the
Sisters of S. Joseph; 1-½ per cent.
under the Sisters of the Holy
Name, S. Benedict, and the School
Sisters of Notre Dame, besides a
few others belonging to different
communities. Of hospitals, the
Sisters of Mercy have 18 per cent.,
the Sisters of Charity 37, Providence
2, Holy Cross 1, S. Francis
7, Little Sisters of the Poor 2,
S. Dominic 5, S. Joseph 11, Sœur
Hospitalières 2, Nazareth 5, and of
all others 20 per cent.
</p>

<p>
Of the teaching orders and communities
in the United States who
devote themselves solely to the
higher branches of education and,
when possible, to the gratuitous
instruction of poor children, we
have the Ladies of the Sacred
Heart, the Ursulines, the Visitation,
the Immaculate Conception,
Presentation, and the Sisters of
the Precious Blood, Loretto, S.
Clare, Our Lady of Angels, S. Ann,
S. Mary, Sacred Heart of Mary,
Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ,
Humility of Mary, S. Agnes, Incarnate
Word, Holy Child, and
Daughters of the Cross. The
Carmelites, Servite Nuns, and Sisters
of S. Anthony are contemplative
communities, though, in some
special instances, the poor are
taught and assisted in their convents.
</p>

<p>
A short account of the origin
and growth in this country of some
of the most prominent orders and
communities may be found acceptable
to those who take an interest
in the successive developments in
the church of works of education
and charity.
</p>

<p>
The first convent established
within the present limits of the
United States&mdash;if we except some,
perhaps, that might have existed
long years since in New Mexico
and California&mdash;was that of the
Ursulines, opened at New Orleans
in 1727, when that city was a portion
of French territory. For
about sixty years, the nuns were
either natives of France or of
French descent, till 1791, when,
<pb n='370'/><anchor id='Pg370'/>
on the occasion of the revolt of the
French colonists in the West Indies,
the convent, with its academy,
hospital, and asylum, received
large accessions from San Domingo.
This house still exists, with an affiliation
at Opelousas, and has branches
in Pittsburg, Cincinnati, St. Louis,
Alton, Cleveland, Galveston, Green
Bay, Mobile, and several other dioceses;
that of New York, situated
in what was formerly a portion of
Westchester County, being the principal,
containing forty-seven members.
The Ursuline Order was
founded in 1532, at Brescia, Italy,
by S. Angela of Merici, and was
approved by Pope Paul III., in
1544, as a religious congregation
under the name of S. Ursula. Eighteen
years after, at the request of
S. Charles Borromeo, Archbishop
of Milan, it was obliged to enclosure,
created an order, and placed
under the rule of S. Augustine by
Pope Gregory XIII. Its special
duty is the education of young
ladies; but a poor school is, when
necessary, attached to each house.
</p>

<p>
Next in point of time was the
Carmelite Nunnery, erected in 1790,
near Port Tobacco, Maryland,
through the exertions of the Rev.
Charles Neale. That zealous clergyman,
having visited Europe in
that year, returned with four nuns,
of whom three are said to have
been Americans and one English.
On account of the difficulties surrounding
their locality, the community
was afterwards transferred
to Baltimore, in 1831, and permitted
to open a school, which, however,
was soon after discontinued. There
are now in all eight houses of this
order in America, of which two&mdash;the
mother-house and one in St.
Louis&mdash;are of the reform of S. Teresa;
the others, following the less
strict rule, add the care of outside
schools, asylums, and hospitals to
their other duties. The Carmelite
order of monks was founded in
the early part of the XIIIth century
under the rule of S. Basil,
which was exceedingly strict as regards
mortification, prayer, and
fasting. The order of nuns was
not created for two centuries after,
when John Lorett, twenty-sixth
general, founded a female institute
under the rule of his order, and
established several convents in
France. In 1452, Pope Nicholas
V. approved the foundation; and
in 1457 Françoise d'Amboise, the
widowed Duchess of Brittany, built
the house at Vannes, in her own
possessions, taking the veil and
habit at the same time. A hundred
years later, S. Teresa of Castile, finding
that many innovations and relaxations
had crept in, undertook
the work of reform, and her efforts
were eventually approved by Pope
Pius IV. in 1562. Thus there became
two branches of the order&mdash;the
Mitigated Carmelites, whose rule
is not so austere as those of the
Discalceated, who follow the reform
of S. Teresa. The latter are obliged
to observe perpetual silence, abstain
from the use of flesh-meat,
sleep on straw, and wear habits of
coarse serge and sandals instead of
shoes. Their habit is a brown
gown, scapular, and hood, and in
choir a white cloak and black veil.
</p>

<p>
Soon after the arrival of the Carmelites
in Maryland, an effort was
made by a few Catholic young ladies
in Philadelphia to establish a
religious community. The principal
movers were Miss Alice Lalor
and a couple of friends. Her companions,
however, having died before
anything tangible could be effected,
Miss Lalor left Philadelphia
for Georgetown, D. C., in 1798, and
established herself there as a teacher.
<pb n='371'/><anchor id='Pg371'/>
Gradually she drew around her
young persons of similar views
and tastes, and a community was
formed, at first simply for the purpose
of prayer and education; but
when, in 1816, their rules had
been approved by the Most Rev.
Leonard Neale, Archbishop of Baltimore,
and recognized by the Holy
Father, they became a regular
branch of the Visitation Order, and
submitted to solemn vows and enclosure.
Their houses now number
about twenty, and are to be found
in Baltimore, Brooklyn, St. Louis,
Mobile, Covington, Dubuque, and
several dioceses in the South and
Southwest. The order dates back
to 1610, when it was founded by
S. Francis de Sales and S. Jane
Frances, Baronne de Chantal.
It was at first merely a congregation,
but by permission of Pope
Paul V. it was changed into a regular
order, the essential principles
of its rule being the education of
the children of the rich, though
many free schools for the poor are
found attached to its convents.
</p>

<p>
While Miss Lalor was working
silently in the District of Columbia,
there was another pious woman&mdash;one
whose name is destined to be for
ever illustrious in the annals of the
church in America&mdash;nobly struggling
against innumerable difficulties
in the same holy cause. This was
Mrs. Eliza A. Seton, the foundress,
in the United States, of the glorious
Sisterhood of Charity. Like all men
or women whom Providence selects
for great ends, Mrs. Seton passed
through a long novitiate of sorrow
and trials before she was found
qualified to lay the corner-stone of
an institution which, above all
others, has made Catholic charity
and womanly self-sacrifice most
useful, most respected and beloved
amongst us. Born in New York
on the 28th of August, 1774, of
wealthy Protestant parents, her
infancy and girlhood were passed
amid all the scenes of pleasure and
luxury that family position and
affluence could command; and it
was not till she had married and
entered upon matronhood that she
experienced her first great grief.
This arose out of the death of her
father, Dr. Bayley, who, in his devotion
to the sick immigrants, at
that time very numerous, fell a victim
to ship-fever. His daughter, it
would appear, felt for him even
more than filial affection and respect,
and his sudden death made
such an impression on her spirits
and such inroads on her health that
she was obliged to make a tour in
Europe in company with her husband,
also an invalid. Her mind
had early been imbued with
strong religious impressions, as well
as cultivated by careful study and
extensive reading; and during her
stay in Southern Europe, where she
had ample opportunities of visiting
the churches and convents, and of
seeing for herself the beauties and
glories of Catholicity, she first began
to long for that rest for the
weary and doubt-distracted soul
which is only found in the bosom
of the church. Her husband, dying
in December, 1802, was buried in
Italy; and she, now left the sole
guardian of her children, returned
to America. But the thoughts that
had come to her in the solemn basilicas
of the Old World followed her to
the New, and would not be dismissed.
She struggled much with them,
prayed fervently, sought the spiritual
advice of many pious friends, and
finally, in 1805, entered the church.
We of this generation can hardly
conceive the sacrifices Mrs. Seton
made in thus becoming a Catholic.
So rife and uncompromising was
<pb n='372'/><anchor id='Pg372'/>
the spirit of Protestant bigotry in
those days that the moment it was
known that she had become a convert,
every friend and relative, the
companions of her youth and the
sharers of her blood, shrank from
her with positive loathing, as if her
touch was infectious. All forsook
her except her children. But she
was a woman of undaunted courage
as well as of implicit faith. She resolved
to leave New York, and take
up her residence in Baltimore, then
the only city in the country where
Catholics had either influence or
social standing. Here, by the advice
of the archbishop, she determined
to devote herself to
teaching, and, to carry out her idea
more fully, to establish a community.
Accordingly, in May, 1809, we find
her, with four companions, setting
out for Emmittsburg to take possession
of a log house and commence
her grand enterprise. On
the first of June, these pioneers of
the Sisters of Charity in the United
States arrived at their destination,
and on the day following, the Feast
of Corpus Christi, they appeared in
the little church of the college in
their habits&mdash;<q>white muslin caps
with crimpt borders, black crape
bands round the head and fastened
under the chin, black dresses, and
short capes similar to those of the
religious of Italy.</q>
</p>

<p>
At first the community was
called the Sisters of S. Joseph; but
in 1810, it was agreed to assimilate
it to the Congregation of Charity in
Europe, and, through the influence
of the Rev. F. Flaget, it was hoped
that some Sisters might be induced
to come from France to take charge
of the little community. Owing to
the disturbed state of the times,
F. Flaget failed to procure the
desired aid; but he brought
with him the rule of the Sisters,
which, having been adopted by
the community, was approved by
Archbishop Neale, January 17,
1812.
</p>

<p>
The growth of the new congregation
was slow, for many unforeseen
difficulties had to be encountered;
but having been planted
deep in the soil, it gradually grew
strong and vigorous, and, when it
once commenced to throw out offshoots
in every direction, they took
root and flourished with wonderful
vitality. In 1814, some Sisters
were sent to Philadelphia to take
charge of the new Catholic orphan
asylum; and in 1817, Mother Seton,
with Sisters Cecilia O'Conway and
Felicité Brady, came to New York,
at the request of Bishop Connolly,
to superintend a similar institution
established by the New York Catholic
Benevolent Society. They
selected a small frame house on
Prince Street, where now stands
their noble asylum. How the
houses of this illustrious community
have multiplied during the last
half-century is truly astonishing,
and can only be attributed to the
help of a Power more than human.
Nearly one hundred asylums
and hospitals are now under
their charge; about the same number
of academies and select schools
claim their care; free schools and
scholars beyond computation enjoy
the blessings of their pious instruction;
and their convents and establishments
dot the country in every
direction. In New York alone,
where the mother-house of the
province is situated at Font Hill,
Yonkers, there are attached to it
409 professed Sisters, 92 novices,
and 13 postulants, who conduct 72
different establishments in New
York, Jersey City, Brooklyn, New
Haven, Providence, and Columbia.
In Newark, in the mother-house of
<pb n='373'/><anchor id='Pg373'/>
the diocese, at Madison, N. J., there
are 190 members; and in almost
every section of the country where
Catholicity is at all known, the
simple black dress and cape, and
the small white collar, of the daughters
of S. Vincent de Paul are familiar
objects. This congregation,
though dating only from March
25, 1634, when Louise de Marillac,
widow of Antoine Le Gras,
secretary to Marie de Medicis, the
first mother of the Daughters of
Charity, consecrated her life to God,
has now, it is said, more than twenty
thousand members throughout the
world, all, like their sainted founder,
Vincent, unremittingly employed
in works of divine charity.
</p>

<p>
Next in order of usefulness,
though not in age, come the Sisters
of Mercy. This congregation is of
Irish origin, having been founded
in Dublin, as late as 1827, by Catharine
McAuley, a native of that
county. Miss McAuley was born
September 17, 1787, of Catholic
parents; but they dying when she
was quite young, her guardianship
was assumed by a Protestant family,
who brought her up in their own
faith&mdash;if faith it may be called; but
the girl early developed a remarkable
inclination towards Catholicity,
and, when of proper age, reunited
herself to the church of her fathers.
At thirty-four she found herself the
possessor of a large fortune bequeathed
to her by her adopted father,
who had become a Catholic on
his death-bed; and this, with all her
subsequent life, she resolved to dedicate
to the service of the Almighty.
She therefore built at her own expense,
in the most fashionable part
of the city, a magnificent convent,
and, associating with herself several
other ladies, commenced the work
of instruction and the visitation of
the sick poor in their homes and
in the public hospitals. The Most
Rev. Dr. Murray, Archbishop of
Dublin, gave her all the assistance
in his power, and, after consulting
with the Holy See, approved the
new foundation. In 1841, Pope
Gregory XVI. confirmed the congregation,
which is now so strong in
the United Kingdom that it numbers
133 convents, besides numerous
charitable institutions. Unlike
the Sisters of Charity, this congregation
has no superior-general,
each convent being independent
and self-governing.
</p>

<p>
Though introduced into this
country by the late Bishop O'Connor,
of Pittsburg, about thirty years
ago, the Sisters of Mercy have
spread rapidly over the United
States. They have already nearly
50 asylums and hospitals, 80 academies
and select schools, an immense
number of free schools, convents
almost as numerous as those
of the Sisters of Charity, and considerably
over 1,300 members. They
are to be found in New York, the
New England dioceses, Albany,
Philadelphia, Louisville, Pittsburg,
most of the old dioceses, and many
of the newer ones.
</p>

<p>
There are other orders and congregations
among us, if not so numerous,
equally meritorious; for instance,
the Ladies of the Sacred
Heart, who conduct about 30 academies
and select schools, in which
the very highest order of education
is imparted; the Sisters of
Notre Dame, also a teaching order,
having the care of 20 houses, in
which there are 431 boarders
and over 1,200 day scholars, besides
about 14,000 pupils attending
the free schools, half that number
in the Sunday-schools, in
addition to those taught in evening
schools and instructed in various
other ways. This congregation,
<pb n='374'/><anchor id='Pg374'/>
though founded in 1804, by
Mother Julia Billiart, assisted by
Marie-Louise-Françoise, Vicomtesse
Blin de Bourbon, and Catharine
Duchâtel, at Amiens, has so
extended its labors that it now
counts in Belgium, England, and
Central America 68 establishments,
12,000 scholars in its boarding
and day schools, and over
32,000 children gratuitously taught
in its free schools. It was introduced
into the United States,
in 1840, by the Most Rev. Dr. Purcell,
Archbishop of Cincinnati, and,
in connection with its convents
and academies, has charge of 70
asylums. The Sisters of S. Joseph,
numbering about sixty communities,
have, by the latest returns, 42 academies,
20 select schools, 20 asylums,
and 9 hospitals. These latter
are specially charged with the instruction
of the colored children of
the South. Then there are the
congregations of the Third Order
of S. Francis and of S. Dominic,
whose duties are equally multifarious;
the Sisters of the Good Shepherd,
whose mission it is to receive
and reform the very outcasts of female
society, and to save young
women from lives of vice and
crime; and the meek Little Sisters
of the Poor, who actually go about
from door to door, from store to
market-place, begging, in the name
of holy charity, for the crumbs of
our tables to feed their aged and
decrepit dependents who are tottering
on the verge of the grave. Besides
these, there are many other
communities of pious women in
our midst, quietly and unostentatiously
pursuing their career of
goodness, the history of whose
foundation the limits of an article
will not allow us to descant
upon. Their actions are doubtless
recorded in another world,
where lie their trust and promised
reward.
</p>

<p>
Thus we have seen how our glorious
land is twice blessed by the
presence of those pure-minded,
zealous, and meek followers of their
Saviour. We are blessed in their
prayers and in their active charity.
No one is so rich as to be independent
of their good offices; no
one so poor, afflicted, or degraded
that they cannot succor and console.
The vilest dens of infamy in our
crowded cities are made almost sacred
by their tread; the far-away
prairies and forests resound with
their chants and songs of praise;
while the daintily-nurtured daughter
of the aristocracy is taught, in
some convent of the Sacred Heart,
or of the Ursulines, to shine in and
adorn her social sphere without
forgetting that she is a Christian;
the poor little negro children of
the everglades of Florida, or the
savage Indian babes of the Pacific
slope, are kneeling at the feet of
some Sister of S. Joseph or of the
Holy Names of Jesus and Mary,
lisping their first prayer. Without
exaggeration, it may be said that
there is no ignorance so dense
that they will not succeed in expelling;
none of the many ills to
which flesh is heir that they cannot
assuage; and that they, and they
alone, of all their sex, <q>can minister
to a mind diseased, and pluck
from the heart a deep-rooted sorrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
And yet all this toil and pain
and solicitude bring with them,
even in this world, abundant rewards.
Who that has ever entered
a convent or a religious
house has not been impressed by
the gentle air of cheerfulness and
inward peace that sits on the faces
of its inmates? We look in vain
for the anxious glance that betrays
<pb n='375'/><anchor id='Pg375'/>
an unsatisfied mind, or the deep-drawn
lines that tell a tale of worldly
struggle and discontent. No;
every countenance is serene, placid,
and healthful. This is the reward
of noble works well performed, the
luxury of doing good, to which the
women of the outer world are for
the most part strangers. But what
shall be the eternal recompense for
those who thus abandon kindred
and home, friends and companions,
the pleasures of the world and the
passions of the heart, to follow in
the footsteps of the Saviour who
was crucified for us, and to carry
out his precepts, regardless of all
consequences, to the end? Such is
the holy nun who storms heaven
with her prayers for the salvation
of mankind and the pardon of national
crimes; such the humble
Sister who devotes the energies of
her mind, the years of her life, nay,
her very life itself, to the service
of God's poor, helpless, and sinful
creatures. Can a nobler ambition
than this find place in the human
mind? Can the glory, the charity,
and the all-absorbing beneficence
of the Christian faith find brighter
examples and purer exponents than
within the convents which so numerously
overspread and are continuing
to increase on the soil of
our young republic?

<head>Switzerland In 1873.</head>

<p>
<q>Going to Lyons to-morrow!
Impossible!</q> exclaimed Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;,
whom my friend and I accidentally
met in the hall of the Berner Hof
Hotel at Berne this autumn. <q>You
cannot surely go without seeing the
Lake of Lucerne! I should be
quite ashamed to confess that I
had been so long in Switzerland
and was leaving without having been
up the Rigi. In fact, if you persist
in this resolution, you will have
to come back again next summer
expressly for that, and for nothing
else. Think what trouble that may
be! And all from want of a little
energy now; for I feel quite certain
you have no appointment to take
you to Lyons in such a hurry. I
know you cannot have,</q> she added
smiling, and noticing some hesitation
on our part, <q>so you must
just change your plans again and
come off to Lucerne with our party
this afternoon! You may go to
Lyons later, if you like, but there
will be time enough to think about
that!</q>
</p>

<p>
It was quite true. There was
no special reason for our starting
for Lyons that day, no pressing
necessity for our leaving Switzerland
just then. The Lake of
Lucerne, moreover, had originally
a prominent place in our itinerary,
and the weather was so fine that there
seemed fair hope of the prescribed
sunrise from the Rigi. But, if the
truth were told, we were weary&mdash;weary
not in body but in soul; and
had taken such an aversion to the
country, from a spiritual point of
view, that a strong antidote&mdash;such
as Lyons with its Notre Dame de
<pb n='376'/><anchor id='Pg376'/>
Fourvières and general Catholic life
would afford&mdash;had become to us
absolutely essential.
</p>

<p>
Six weeks previously we entered
Switzerland&mdash;two ladies overflowing
with enthusiasm. The picturesque
was certainly a main object
in our journey; for where else can
it be equalled, or found in such
variety? Still, we had no intention
whatever of leaving religion and devotion
behind us, and never doubted
for a moment that we should succeed
in finding means of satisfying
our desires.
</p>

<p>
It was our first visit to this region,
and our knowledge of it, we
are bound to confess, was most
superficial. But how little does
one know of a foreign country
until either long residence or some
special circumstance excites the
curiosity or rouses the attention!
Catholics even, who as a rule interest
themselves more than all others
about the religious state of countries
outside their own&mdash;instigated
by that principle of universal brotherhood,
that bond of spiritual
union, which the church so effectually
promotes&mdash;seldom know, notwithstanding,
the details of current ecclesiastical
foreign events, unless accident
brings them to the spot. A great
commotion like the warfare going
on in Geneva, and the fact that the
attitude of the Catholic community
in that town was most noble, and
those willing <q>to suffer persecution
for justice' sake</q> neither few nor
faint-hearted, had of course a large
place in our view of the case. But
except this, and the broad facts
that Geneva, Berne, and Zurich
were Protestant, Lucerne and its
neighborhood Catholic, we are constrained
to admit that our acquaintance
with Swiss matters, geographical,
historical, or ecclesiastical, was
very limited. It is little wonder,
therefore, that we lent a willing ear
to the thoughtless assertions of
fellow-travellers, who told us we
should find Catholic churches
scattered all over these districts.
Without further questioning, then,
we proceeded, commencing by a
few days at Lausanne and along
the shores of the lovely Lake of
Geneva. Thence we made our way
to Bellalp, Zermatt, the Eichhorn,
and, finally, passing round to the
northern side of the great mountains,
wandered on from the Faulhorn,
Scheideck, and Wengern Alps
to Mürren, where we rested for several
days, having <q>done</q> sunsets
and sunrises, peaks and glaciers, until
our minds were filled with the
most magnificent images. Still, despite
all these wonderful beauties of
nature, which seemed every day to
draw us more closely and more
humbly towards the Creator, an
irrepressible dreariness had crept
over us, from the absence of all
visible signs of union with him or
of grateful worship on the part of
man. Certain it is that the result
our present wanderings had produced
by the time we reached Berne
was a longing for a Catholic land
and Catholic churches, where we
might pour forth our praises, and
give utterance to our thanksgivings
for the glorious sights we
had seen; a longing that had
grown stronger than the mere love
of the sublime and beautiful, for its
own sake, of which we were, nevertheless,
most ardent votaries.
</p>

<p>
It may be said that, coming to
Protestant cantons as we did, we
ought not to have expected a profusion
of Catholic churches; the
Catholic population is small, especially
in the highland districts, and
labors under many disadvantages.
True, and after the first disappointment
was over, we were ready to
<pb n='377'/><anchor id='Pg377'/>
study our excursions, and often to
shorten them, in order to hear
Mass on Sundays. Yet even so,
more than once we could not even
accomplish this; and the difficulty
of approaching the sacraments under
these circumstances is most
distressing to travellers. Besides,
to an outside observer, piety does
not seem to flourish; or, where it
does, the Catholic congregations
have that subdued look peculiar
to all persecuted communities, so
extremely depressing to witness.
Many believe that, for this and
other reasons, the battle now raging
in Geneva and elsewhere will
be productive of great gain, and
that Switzerland and Germany will
emerge from a life resembling that
of the early Christians in the Catacombs,
only with tenfold power and
vigor. At the present moment,
one is chiefly led to reflect on the
false interpretation of that freedom
so much boasted of by the Swiss
Protestants&mdash;if one may so style the
advanced liberals and free-thinkers
who come to the surface nowadays&mdash;and
remember how easily an
American Catholic could make
them blush by his report of how
differently these matters are treated
across the Atlantic.
</p>

<p>
Our path had nowhere, as yet, it
is true, touched on a Catholic canton;
and there all <emph>might</emph> be different,
though everything we could
glean led us to a contrary expectation.
An old German who had
been coming to Switzerland for the
last thirty years, and whom we met
<foreign rend='italic'>en route</foreign>, told us it was all the
same. <q>No religion anywhere.
Nothing can be more uninteresting
than the people,</q> he asserted.
<q>Bent only on money-making and
fighting about religion&mdash;religion,
that is to say, in name, but not in
deed; the disputes are purely party
questions, and have no real, substantial
foundation. Peaks and
passes are alone worth a thought,</q>
he added. On these he was inexhaustible,
but always dismissed the
other subject with contempt. Later,
when our own observations in
the Catholic cantons completely altered
our opinions, we also ascertained
that he, like so many of the
summer tourists one encounters
nowadays, was perfectly indifferent
to all forms of worship, and
blind to those signs and manifestations
of the inner being which still
abound in all that region. Meanwhile,
however, his report, coming
from one familiar with every part
of Switzerland, carried conviction
to our untutored minds, as, no
doubt, happens in similar cases
every day.
</p>

<p>
But it was not, perhaps, the difficulty
about, and paucity of, Catholic
service which so much roused
our indignation, once we saw the
small number of our co-religionists,
as the universal aridity, tepidity,
nay, coldness, of all the inhabitants
of these favored regions. Nor
could we gain much knowledge
about them. The ordinary tourist
never meets a Swiss above the class
of guides and hotel-keepers; the
former, in the Protestant cantons,
are a stolid, uncommunicative race
of men, with all their intellects apparently
given to their horses and
<hi rend='italic'>Trinkgeld</hi>; the latter too much engrossed
in the feverish anxiety of
drawing up large bills and providing
for the passing crowd to give
attention to any other matter during
the summer season. Besides,
the line of interest does not run in
the direction of the <q>people</q>; if
it did, these men would no doubt
also labor to supply the demand;
as it is, few have time, or, having
time, inclination, for anything but
<pb n='378'/><anchor id='Pg378'/>
scenery, and next to scenery&mdash;sometimes
first&mdash;come food and lodging.
</p>

<p>
It was unreasonable, many observed,
to aspire to more. <q>A
thorough knowledge of a nation is
not to be picked up in passing</q>;
<q>One comes to Switzerland for the
scenery only</q>; <q>The people cannot
be judged by outward appearances,</q>
were phrases which met us
at every turn whenever we ventured
to make a remark. <q>Doubtless
the people <emph>may</emph> be excellent,</q>
was our reply; <q>but outward appearances
<emph>are</emph> an index to their
minds. In the Tyrol, Bohemia,
Brittany, and other Catholic lands,
all who <q>run may read.</q></q> Mountain
chapels, wayside crosses, holy pictures
inside and outside their dwellings,
speak a language common to
all Christian hearts; and the indifferentism
and dryness of soul which
their absence betokens in the Bernese
Oberland, especially amidst
its grandest scenes and greatest
dangers, cannot fail to leave a
most painful impression on every
thoughtful traveller.
</p>

<p>
The only information we found
it easy to gather related to everything
connected with material subjects.
In a surprisingly short
space of time, we knew, from our
guides, the names of all the peaks,
and many, too, of the smaller summits,
and, above all, could speak in
an authoritative tone of the best
hotels in different places, the price
of <foreign rend='italic'>pension</foreign> in each, whether the Kellners
were civil, the living better in
one than another, Cook's tickets an
advantage or not, where the carriage-roads
ended and the riding
or walking began&mdash;in fine, became
very clever on all those points
which form the staple of conversation
at all Swiss hotels and halting-places.
Yet we conscientiously
employed our eyes and ears, so as
to come to no wrong conclusion.
The more one travels in Switzerland,
the more necessary this precaution
seems. Whatever efforts we
made, however, brought about the
same unfavorable result. The whole
aspect of the country we traversed
justified our German acquaintance's
harsh criticisms. Even the
Protestant churches, which, if only
from a pure spirit of opposition, one
might expect to show a flourishing
exterior, are in Switzerland more
than usually bald and cheerless.
Unlike English churches of the
present day, they are completely
innocent of the slightest approach
to decoration, and very often without
sign of communion-table or
anything even representing it.
Sometimes a bare slab of marble,
without altar-cloth or covering,
stands in the middle; but often
this is brought out only at stated
periods for the administration of
the Lord's Supper, and, as a rule,
the seats are ranged round the pulpit&mdash;the
only centre of attraction in
these buildings. Of all nations,
the English show the most tangible
signs of life. They, at least, bring
themselves more prominently forward;
for the first paper that strikes
the eye on entering every Swiss inn
is the list of services and chaplains
supplied to Switzerland for the
season by the English Church Colonial
Society. Churches they do
not possess, except in a few favored
spots; and many are the lamentations
amongst the wandering
Britons at being obliged to content
themselves with the drawing-room
or billiard-room of a large hotel,
where probably the evening before
they had assembled amidst gaiety
and laughter. It is an arrangement,
too, often complained of by the
other inmates&mdash;one which led to a
serious dispute in one place, where
<pb n='379'/><anchor id='Pg379'/>
the German visitors claimed their
right to the billiard-table at the
hour appointed by the English
chaplain for his service. Still,
there they are, mindful, at least, of
<q>Sabbath worship,</q> when the majority
of their co-religionists see
no necessity for remembering it.
</p>

<p>
Crowds of Anglican clergymen
were also found travelling, on their
own account, in the Protestant
cantons. Five-and-twenty were together
one day at Mürren, of all
shades and hues, too; from my Lord
Bishop, with his wife and daughters,
to the young Ritualist curate, in his
Roman collar and otherwise Catholic
dress, the highest ambition
of whose heart is to be taken&mdash;or
rather <emph>mistaken</emph>&mdash;for a true Catholic
priest. And very hard it is to
distinguish him, at first sight, from
the genuine character, so exact has
he made the superficial copy. After
a little conversation, however,
it is easy to know that such unmitigated
abuse of the Episcopal dignitary
who sits at the other end of
the room, and of the whole bench
of bishops, cannot belong to the
true church, which not only enjoins
but practises submission to authority.
Intellectual these High-Churchmen
always are, and would make
pleasant company but for the
crookedness of their <q>opinions,</q> and
their unconcealed exultation, too,
at the assumed progress of the so-called
<q>Old-Catholic</q> movement,
which they represent as undermining
the whole of Switzerland. Catholic
Switzerland they always meant;
for even they could not blind
themselves to the fact that in the
Protestant districts there is little
left to take away. One could only
wonder how, with their hankering
after Catholic things, they
could in any way feel drawn towards
those cantons; and it more
than ever strengthened our conviction
(though nothing offends
them more than such a suggestion)
that the sole binding link between
these English High-Churchmen
and the miscellaneous companies
which assemble at the <q>Old-Catholic</q>
meetings is their common
ground of rebellion to mother
church&mdash;which, as daily experience
infallibly proves, gathers together
all grades of belief and unbelief
outside the Catholic fold, and
induces them to ignore all their
important differences in the bond
of a hatred which is truly preternatural
to the spouse of Christ!
</p>

<p>
Wet days at Swiss hotels are
proverbially fruitful of talk and
discussion; and nowadays these
religious subjects are certain to be
started by some new Ritualistic acquaintance,
who evidently presumes
on sympathy from English-speaking
travellers. Above all, should
he or she discover that you are a
<q>Romanist,</q> as they choose to
call us children of the true church,
it is most curious to observe
what an irresistible secret attraction
impels them to follow you,
from morning to night, with their
arguments and spiritual <q>views.</q>
Oh! what days of annoyance continued
rain has cost us on those
mountain-tops&mdash;days of true annoyance
unmixed with good; for
in no single instance did we find
any permanent impression made
on these Ritualists, who, of all Protestants,
are the most hopelessly
blinded and obstinate. And most
fully do we agree with a high ecclesiastical
authority who recently
remarked to us that all other
shades of churchmen, including the
evangelical or Low Church, respond
to the call of grace more
readily than these men and women,
whose stand-point is that pride
<pb n='380'/><anchor id='Pg380'/>
which obscures their spiritual vision.
After two or three such discussions,
we foresaw the point exactly
when they would dogmatically
assert that they, <q>too, are Catholics,</q>
and that an irreparable breach
was to be the immediate consequence
of the solemn protest which it became
our duty to make on each
similar occasion. Before we reached
Mürren, therefore, we had
learnt to avoid them. By that
time, too, we found that all their
information about <q>Old Catholics</q>
was derived either from the English
newspapers or those foreign
ones which, in rainy, stay-at-home
weather, are studied in those places
with persevering assiduity.
</p>

<p>
We ourselves endeavored to gather
from this source some of that
information unattainable elsewhere,
but very soon indignantly threw
aside these tainted productions.
Our German friend was right on
this point, certainly; for anything
more shameful and less religious
than the attacks on the
priesthood in general, the false
statements put forward, and the
undisguised rationalism&mdash;not to give
it a worse name&mdash;of most of these
foreign newspapers which flood
the reading-rooms of Switzerland,
it would be difficult to imagine.
Not a single Catholic newspaper
came under our eye in the <foreign rend='italic'>pensions</foreign>
and hotels. If they were taken
in, they were certainly hidden away;
and the tone of the German
press, in particular, perfectly justified
the assertion which has been
hazarded&mdash;namely, that it has altogether
fallen into the hands of the
once-despised Jews. Alas! alas!
the <q>Israelites</q> of the present day
may well exult and lift up their
heads in the remarkable and daily-increasing
manner so noticeable all
over Europe, where the faith of
Christians is so tepid and their
sight so weak as no longer to distinguish
the true from the false
in these proud and <q>enlightened</q>
days!
</p>

<p>
Disheartened by all we saw and
heard, we frequently turned to the
poor, in the hope of better feelings;
and although no outward token of
man's habitual remembrance of
his Maker met our observation, we
tried to lead the guides and peasants
to speak, now and then, on
these subjects. In vain, however.
They appeared to have no thoughts
to communicate, no familiarity with
the supernatural, nor other answer
but the dry, curt one to give: <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Wir
sind alle Reformirten im Canton
Berne</foreign>&mdash;<q>We are all Reformed in
the Canton of Berne.</q>
</p>

<p>
This hard, unsympathetic tone of
mind jarred on our highest and
tenderest feelings; and the grander
the surrounding scenery, the more
painful its impression. It had
reached its climax a few days before
we met Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; at Berne.
</p>

<p>
Having slept one night at Lauterbrunnen,
and the next morning
proving lovely, we determined to go
on at once to Grindelwald. There
had been no service of any kind at
the village of Mürren; but here a
bell rang early, and we had thus
begun the day by lamenting that it
did not summon us to Mass before
starting on our journey. But this
being a strictly <q>Reformed</q> neighborhood,
it was foolish to nourish
any such hope. The sparkling rays
of sunlight on the Staabbart, however,
the drive through the magnificent
valley, the rushing torrent, and
opening views of our favorite mountains,
free from the veil of mist that
had covered them on the previous
day, the exhilarating air, and general
brightness of a grand nature,
gradually restored us to more contented
<pb n='381'/><anchor id='Pg381'/>
dispositions. The day was
splendid. The Wetterhorn, Finsteraarhorn,
Eiger, and Jungfrau stood
erect before and above us, as we
drove up to the hotel, in all their
grandeur, sternness, and soft beauty
withal; their spotless snows and
blue glaciers running down amongst
and fringing the green, placid pastures
below, whilst Grindelwald
itself, the pretty village of scattered
<foreign rend='italic'>châlets</foreign>, lay bathed in sunshine at
their feet. It was the beginning of
September; yet the visitors were
so few and imperceptible that we
felt as if we alone had possession
of this wonderful scene. Nor was
there a breath of wind or a cloud
in the sky, in an atmosphere of
transparent brilliancy&mdash;one of
those rare days which seem lent to
us from Paradise, when one's only
thought can be that of thankfulness;
one's only sigh, <q>Lord! it is good
for us to be here.</q> We had been
sitting for some time on a grassy
slope, drinking in all this ethereal
beauty, and gazing silently on those
<q>great apostles of nature, those
church-towers of the mountains,</q> as
Longfellow so beautifully calls them,
when our thoughts wandered on to
the perils peculiar to such a spot.
Of the two glaciers right before
us, one&mdash;the smaller one, it is true&mdash;had
all but disappeared within
the last four years. It had melted
away gradually during an unusually
hot summer, the guide had told us,
though fortunately without causing
any considerable damage in the
valley underneath. Very different
it would be if the larger one were
to vanish; and we naturally reverted
to a description we had recently
read, by a well-known dignitary of
the English Church, of the appalling
catastrophe near Martigny, in 1818,
when the whole district was made
desolate and villages swept away, in
consequence of the breaking-up of
a similar glacier under the Lake of
Mauvoisin. We had just said that
if any people should <q>stand ready</q>
it certainly was the Swiss, when
suddenly, as if in response to our
meditations, the silvery sound of a
church-bell came wafted to us
through the balmy air. The building
itself was out of sight, hidden
behind a small knoll; so we hastened
at once on a voyage of discovery
in search of it. The day and hour
were so unusual that a faint hope
arose of finding some out-of-the-way
Catholic convent, forgotten,
perhaps, by the old <q>Reformers.</q>
It was only the small church of the
village, however. The bell was
still ringing, and the door open, but
no one near; and, entering in, nothing
was to be seen save an empty
interior with whitewashed walls,
where a few benches alone indicated
that it served any purpose or
ever emerged from its present forlorn
and desolate condition. Perplexed
for an explanation, we appealed
to some villagers in the
vicinity&mdash;old women who, had it
been a Catholic church, were
just the sort of bodies one would
have found telling their beads in
some corner of it at every hour of
the day; but blank countenances
were all we elicited by our first
question of why the bell was ringing
or what service was about to
begin. <q>Service! What service?</q>
they answered inquiringly. <q>Divine
service</q>&mdash;<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Gottesdienst</foreign>&mdash;we
replied, making the question more
explicit, the better to suit their
capacities. <q>Divine service? Oh!
that is only on Sundays, of course,</q>
was their answer; and it never
seemed to cross their minds that
people ought also to pray on other
days. In fact, no single person in
the place could give any reason for
<pb n='382'/><anchor id='Pg382'/>
the tolling of this bell (evidently
the Vesper-bell of old Catholic
times), except that it rung regularly
on every afternoon at 3 o'clock. A
poverty-stricken, unhealthy-looking
population they were, too&mdash;just
the class that stand much in need
of spiritual comforts&mdash;of those aids
from heaven which the poor need
more palpably even than the possessors
of material wealth, in order
to bring them through the troubles
of this weary world, and to sustain
their courage at every step. Both
here and at Lauterbrunnen, despite
all police prohibitions, our
carriage was followed by numbers
of sickly and deformed children,
whose monotonous drone was unenlivened
by one bright look, by
any petition <q>for the love of God,</q>
or any of those touching variations
of the Catholic beggar in every part
of the world, which, no matter what
one may say at the time, do appeal
to a Christian heart more than any
one is aware of until made sensible
of their impression by the chilly
effects of their absence on such occasions.
</p>

<p>
But our spirits revived, as we returned
to Interlachen, at sight of
the old Franciscan convent standing
embosomed in its stately trees.
Hitherto we had only passed
through the place on our way to
and from the mountain excursions;
but to-morrow would be Sunday, and
the Catholic service, we had ascertained,
was in the convent church.
Away, therefore, with our saddened
hearts and dismal musings! The
plain would evidently treat us more
charitably than the highland country
had hitherto done! Beautiful,
lovely Interlachen! lying amidst its
brown, flowery meadows, under its
stately walnut-trees; the white-robed
Jungfrau rising opposite in
all her dignified beauty, unaccompanied
by Monk or Eiger, or any of
her snowy compeers. The sun was
setting as we drove up to the hotel
Victoria just in time to see its
deep-red, crimson farewell, thrown
across the brow of the grand mountain,
melt gradually into the most
tender violet, as if in mourning for
his departure. And as we sat on
the balcony all that evening in the
stillness of the autumnal air, watching
the full moon shining on the
<q>pale Virgin,</q> making her glitter
like silver, and stand out, in all her
majesty, from the dark, enclosing
line of intervening hills, we felt once
more how glorious is God's creation
in all its simple magnificence!
How grand, how awful it can be!
And again, at dawn, we beheld the
same spotless peak receive with a
tender, pink blush the first rays of
the returning sun, to dazzle us
henceforward during all that day by
her transcendent loveliness through
an ethereal veil of transparent delicacy,
and to draw our thoughts
heavenward, pointing upwards like
a faithful angel guardian anxious
to remind us that all this earthly
beauty is as naught compared to
the bright visions which await us
beyond!
</p>

<p>
It was nine o'clock that morning
before the church-bell sounded;
but then we sallied forth with full
hearts, and made our way along the
beautiful avenue of walnut-trees
towards the old convent. With
elastic gait we ascended the ancient
steps of the ivy-mantled church,
rejoicing in the sign-post which
boastfully pointed <q>à l'Eglise
Catholique</q>! But vain were our
illusions! How could we have
been so sanguine! This fine old
convent, as perfect as at the time
of its suppression in 1527, is far too
valuable, think the authorities, to
be given up by an antagonistic government
<pb n='383'/><anchor id='Pg383'/>
to the successors of its
original owners. A large part of
the dwelling portion, therefore, is
used by the commune of Interlachen
for its public offices, whilst the
remainder is divided between the different
foreign <q>persuasions</q> that visit
Interlachen every summer. That
high-sounding title, <q>l'Eglise Catholique,</q>
belonged only to a small
chapel constructed out of one end
of the church&mdash;the smaller end&mdash;and
floored, moreover, up to half its
height. The other and larger portion
was given up for the English
Church service, whilst the Free Kirk
of Scotland and <q>l'Eglise Evangélique
de France,</q> were installed here
and there amongst the cloisters.
Most correctly, then, did an old
man, who was found sweeping out
the passages, describe himself as
employed by <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>tous les cultes</foreign>.
</p>

<p>
Nor was the Catholic congregation
more permanent than the
others. It appeared to consist
chiefly of strangers, and the priest,
a Frenchman, who spoke in feeling
accents of the persecution
going on throughout the country,
announced that although the following
day would be a holiday, there
could be no Mass; for he had to
quit Interlachen on that same evening.
</p>

<p>
As we came out from the convent,
sad and gloomy, a pretty sight
awaited us: hundreds of boys and
girls, of all sizes and ages, marching
to the strains of a band towards a
large meadow hard by, where gymnastic
and other games were about
to commence. Orderly and bright-looking
they all were, accompanied
by half the population of
the town and neighborhood, chiefly
attired in the picturesque Bernese
costume, and including, evidently,
the fathers and mothers of the
young generation. It was a most
brilliant yet soothing picture, as we
beheld them passing on under the
shade of the wide-spreading, lofty
walnut-trees; the little maidens in
their fresh summer dresses, embroidered
muslin aprons, and hats
crowned with masses of flowers,
standing out against the green background
of the nearer mountains,
whilst the lovely Jungfrau beyond
shone out resplendent beneath the
rays of a dazzling sun. Long stood
we watching them; for it was a scene
to enjoy and treasure up in one's
memory. What a pity that the recollection
should be darkened by
the after-knowledge that none of
this merry crowd had begun the day
by divine worship! And noteworthy
was this fact, making all the
difference between this and the Catholic
practice in such matters. Nor
shall we fail to remember, if ever
again taunted by those Protestants
who consider it a sin to be light-hearted
on the Sabbath, that this
mode of keeping Sunday is not
sanctioned by a Catholic, but by
one of their own cherished <q>Reformed</q>
cantons. Catholic the
proceedings truly were, in being
orderly, innocent, healthful, and rational;
but most <emph>un</emph>catholic in not
having even allowed the time necessary
for religion. No Catholic
ecclesiastical authority sanctions
such amusements on Sundays without
the whole population having
had the opportunity of hearing Mass
first&mdash;a matter that is not left optional,
but made obligatory on every
member of the church. Here, on
the contrary, there is only one service
in the Protestant church, and
that at 10 o'clock <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.m.</hi>; so that,
even had they wished it, none of
these merry-makers could have
been present. Nor, during the
whole of that day, did we hear any
neighboring village-bells summoning
<pb n='384'/><anchor id='Pg384'/>
their flocks to prayer. Indeed,
many of the villages are without
any churches. There is none, for
instance, at Mürren, nor in many of
the hamlets along the Lake of
Brienz, nor in various other spots
which might easily be named. One
hears a vast deal about Swiss <q>pasteurs,</q>
and pretty stories are written
wherein they figure largely; but
it is only natural to conclude that
if there are numberless villages
without churches, they are equally
without <q>pasteurs</q>; and one cannot
help wondering how the sick and
poor fare in these distant parts in
the ice-bound winter weather, nor
avoid fearing that there is much
truth in the dreary suggestions we
often heard expressed, that they
constantly die and are buried without
any spiritual ministrations whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
And yet the Swiss, and especially
the people of this neighborhood,
did not always voluntarily abandon
the ancient church, nor lapse of a
sudden into the indifferentism now
so general. But no doubt the
present apathy is the inherited result
of the mixed notions which
actuated their forefathers, and the
absence amongst them of that pure
attachment to their faith and the unconquerable
steadiness and manliness
by which the adjoining cantons
of Unterwalden and Uri have so
eminently distinguished themselves
up to the present hour.
</p>

<p>
Whilst meditating over all we
had seen and heard, we accidentally
opened Zschokke's <hi rend='italic'>History of
Switzerland</hi> at the page where he
speaks of those mixed feelings
which were perceptible in all the
religious divisions between 1527
and 1528. The writer is a Protestant,
and therefore his version is all
the more interesting, as admitting
the coercion it was necessary to
use for the introduction of the
new doctrines&mdash;doubly interesting,
too, as read here, at Interlachen,
on the spot and by the light of the
similar system&mdash;for there is nothing
new under the sun&mdash;at present in
full operation in so many of these
same cantons.
</p>

<p>
After speaking of various disputes,
he says: <q>For of those who
raised their voices against the new
creed, thousands upon thousands
were actuated, not by piety or love
of the good and true, but by interested
motives under pretence of
religion. Amongst the country
people, many expected greater
liberties and rights by the introduction
of the recent doctrines; and
when these were not granted to
them, they returned to the Catholic
faith. The moment the town
council of Berne suppressed the
convent at Interlachen, and appointed
preachers of the reformed
church, the peasants, highly pleased,
thought and said: <q>No convent
mesnes, no taxes, no feudal service.</q>
But when the town only transferred
the taxes and service to itself, the
peasants, through pure anger, became
Catholic again, drove away
the Protestant preachers, and
marched in armed bodies to Thun.
Berne hereupon appealed to its
other subjects, offering to leave the
matter to their arbitration; for the
town desired peace, knowing well
that neither quick nor efficient aid
could be counted on by them from
the neighboring cantons, which
were all Catholic. These subjects
of Berne, flattered by the confidence
reposed in them by the
authorities, decided in their favor,
saying: <q>The worldly rights of
the convent go to the worldly authorities,
and are in no wise the
property of the peasants.</q> On
hearing this, the rebellious country-folk
<pb n='385'/><anchor id='Pg385'/>
of Grindelwald returned to their
homes, but in no contented mood,
although the town had relieved
them from many burdens, in favor
of their suffering poor.</q> And
curious it was to note the tight
hold still retained on these same
worldly goods by the commune of
Interlachen, and to see, after a
lapse of three centuries, their <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>bureaux
administratifs</foreign> still located in
the cloisters; nor can it be supposed
that the <q>suffering poor</q> of Grindelwald
have reaped much benefit
from their three centuries of secular
masters, if we may judge by the
numberless beggars who now over-run
that whole district.
</p>

<p>
Having then related that much
discontent at the state of affairs
was felt by the monks of Interlachen,
the abbot of Engelberg, and
the inhabitants of Oberhasli&mdash;a district
which, though under the
protection of Berne, held many
rights and privileges independent
of that town&mdash;Zschokke proceeds:
<q>When the commune of Oberhasli,
encouraged by the monks of Engelberg
and their neighbors of Unterwalden,
likewise drove away the
Protestant parsons, and sent to Uri
and Unterwalden for Catholic
priests, those of Grindelwald did
the same; Aeschi, Frutigen, Obersimmel,
and other villages followed
their example, and the Unterwaldeners
even sent them military assistance
across the Brunig. But
Berne flew to arms at once, and
her army marched on rapidly, before
the secession had time to increase.
The timid and discontented
peasants fled in a panic, and
even the Unterwaldeners retreated
over the mountain. Berne then
punished Oberhasli severely&mdash;took
away its public seal and many
other privileges for a long period;
for ever deprived the valley of
the right to elect its own landamman;
had the ringleaders of the
movement executed, and forced the
others to plead for pardon on their
knees, surrounded by a circle of
armed soldiers. Frutigen, the Simmenthal,
and others were also
brought back by main force to the
Protestant faith</q>&mdash;if <q>faith</q> that
can be called, we may add, which
shows no sign of life in all these
places.
</p>

<p>
In no happy frame of mind we
pushed on next day to Berne, half
inclined to abandon the remainder
of our Swiss tour&mdash;an inclination
which had ripened to a determination
by the time we met our friend
in the hall of the Berner Hof on the
following morning.
</p>

<p>
In Berne, as in other of the
large Swiss towns, Catholicity has
made itself both seen and felt of
late years, and a handsome church
has recently been built there, in
place of the one which was formerly
shared with the Lutherans in that
extraordinary manner still in operation
in one or two Protestant parts
of Germany. Some friends of ours,
who had passed through Berne
about fifteen years ago, had been at
Mass early one Sunday morning,
and, returning at a later hour, found
the same church in possession of
the Protestants, the only difference
observable being the <q>communion-table,</q>
then placed at the end opposite
to the Catholic altar, and the
chairs turned round in that direction.
This anomalous state of things has
now ceased, and the new Catholic
church is both pretty and well served.
But the week-day congregation
is very small, and the half-past seven
o'clock Mass we found but thinly
attended. Still, there it is, even so,
in striking contrast to the Protestant
cathedral. In pleasing contrast,
were more truly said; for
<pb n='386'/><anchor id='Pg386'/>
this beautiful pre-Reformation cathedral,
with its splendid porch
of the Wise and Foolish Virgins,
its elaborately-carved choir, and its
old stained-glass History of the
Blessed Eucharist, is lifeless and
colorless in its present aspect.
Though we went there at an early
hour, every door was closed, except
one at the side, jealously guarded
by a cross old woman, who hindered
all entrance until we had each
paid thirty centimes. Then we were
handed on to another woman&mdash;between
them they had charge of
the church&mdash;who ran from one
party of sight-seers to another,
showing off the different points in a
loud voice, just as if it were a museum
or any other secular building!
Had it been an English cathedral
church even, there would probably
have been a daily service; but then
such a pious practice seemed quite
as unfamiliar as to the peasants of
Grindelwald. The old guardian
stared at us in blank surprise on
our asking the question, and&mdash;seeming
to imply that she detected
we were <q>Papists</q>&mdash;proudly answered,
<q>Certainly not! Only on
Sundays, and then at nine o'clock.</q>
</p>

<p>
As usual, no communion-table
stood in the place of the high altar,
but here, as in many other Swiss
churches, a large black marble table
which serves for this purpose stands
right in front of the choir and pulpit,
and the stalls immediately near
were assigned to the <q>Guardian of
the Holy Supper</q> and one or two
other of the church functionaries.
In the cathedral square outside, the
town has recently placed the beautiful
statue of Rudolf von Erlach,
the great hero of Laupen, one of
the starting-points of its history, in
1339. It was impossible, as we
passed it, not to remember that the
most glorious victories of Berne
were fought and won in those
olden days of the true faith, when
her sons knew how to unite the
love of freedom with devotion to
the church and obedience to her
authority, and that one of the
prominent causes of that great and
victorious battle was their refusal
to recognize the Emperor Louis of
Germany, simply because the pope
had recently excommunicated him.
Those golden days of Bernese history!
of which her Protestant historian,
Zschokke, is constrained to say
that <q>the town, which was threatened
with entire destruction, became
so victorious as henceforward to
threaten destruction to all her enemies.
Her citizens had fought with
one thousand iron arms against ten
thousand; all with one mind and
one heart; no one for himself, but
all for the good of the town. In
this manner alone can wonders be
effected.</q>
</p>

<p>
Full of sad thoughts on the degeneracy
of her present children,
who strive to use their powerful influence
over the rest of their
confederates for the persecution
and suppression of their former
faith, we turned to seek information
at the railway station about the
trains to Lyons or Mâcon, persuaded
that a further stay on Swiss
ground would only increase our
discontent; and, truly, our wrath
grew to fever heat when, passing by
the book-stall, we found it filled with
the most shocking caricatures&mdash;and
worse&mdash;of everything Catholic, nay,
everything religious. Illustrated
<hi rend='italic'>Lives of the Saints</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Of the Pious Helen</hi>,
and such like titles, got up in
the most attractive form, first caught
our eyes and rejoiced our hearts
with the hope of better things; but
anything more scandalous than the
scenes there depicted, the low, disgraceful
ideas put forward, in the

coarsest style, by both pen and
pencil, we never before beheld exposed
in any civilized community.
In England the police would at
once have interfered and seized
the whole establishment. Here
they covered the book-stall; and the
woman who presided showed us
undisguisedly that they were written
and printed in Germany, and
sent here for sale. What hope is
there for populations who, in the
name of religion, can countenance
such wickedness?
</p>

<p>
It was at this stage of our perambulations
and in this condition of
mind that, on returning to the hotel,
we had encountered Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;.
She was no Catholic, but, entering
into all our feelings, she protested
that we should find everything quite
different in the Catholic cantons,
if we only <emph>would</emph> make the experiment.
She had been there often,
and knew that we should be delighted
with them. To every objection
we made she had a ready
answer. Besides, what is more
magical than the bright faces and
kind looks of friends&mdash;above all,
of old friends, when met abroad?
As a natural consequence, therefore,
it was not surprising to us to find
ourselves, after all, seated with this
pleasant party in the train which
that afternoon was leaving for
Lucerne. Our equanimity, it is
true, was disturbed at the junction
at Olten&mdash;by the sight of that manufacturing
town full of the <q>free
thought</q> and advanced liberals of
modern society, the head-quarters
of Old-Catholic meetings, and
the only place where, at that date,
the parish church had been given
up to one of the few rebellious
priests, whilst its true pastor was
obliged to live in a small private
house, where he still ministered to
his old flock as in the days of
early Christian persecution. But
we soon reached Lucerne and a
Catholic atmosphere, and what befell
us in that quarter, what we
saw and heard from its people,
shall be related in the following
chapters to our kind and indulgent
readers.

<p>
By The Author Of <q>The House Of Yorke.</q>
</p>

<p>
Our two travellers did not know
how far removed they were from
the common ways of life till they
were again on land. The strangeness
of a sea-voyage had made their
own strangeness less apparent; but
when they saw homes, and all the
daily interests of life moving on as
once they had moved for them,
familiar things assumed in their
eyes a certain grotesque appearance,
and they scarcely knew themselves
or each other. How hollow
sounded the careless laugh they
heard, how terrible the jest! How
impossible they found it to comprehend
how business and pleasure
could absorb men's souls! To
them this gay and busy world was
wandering recklessly on the brink
of an unseen precipice which they
alone could see.
</p>

<p>
Annette Gerald had adopted her
husband's inner, as well as his outer,
life&mdash;had, as it were, stepped inside
his guilt, and wrapped it round her,
and his world was henceforth her
world. With his eyes she saw a
leafless and flowerless England
sweep behind her as they sped onward
to London; and she shrank,
even as he did, when the thick fog
of the great city took them in and
shut them as if in walls of stone.
</p>

<p>
<q>We cannot stay here,</q> her husband
said. <q>I should lose my
senses in twenty-four hours. This
fog makes me feel like a smoky
house. Are you too tired to go on?
Do let us have sunshine, at least.</q>
</p>

<p>
No, she was never too tired to go
on with him.
</p>

<p>
They had a compartment to
themselves, and, weary as they
were, started on again, a little relieved
in mind. No one had accosted
them in either of the great
cities, and there seemed to be no
immediate danger. Overcome with
fatigue and loss of sleep, they both
leaned back in the soft cushions,
and slept soundly till some sound
or a slackening of their speed
awakened them.
</p>

<p>
The London fog was far away,
and they found themselves passing
slowly and smoothly through a
cloud-world of blue and silver.
There was no land in sight. The
window at one side showed them a
cliff that might be alabaster, and
might be an illuminated cloud. At
the other side, a deep-blue sea,
foam-flecked, and a deep blue sky
half-veiled in silvery mists, were so
entangled with each other that only
where the full moon rode could
they be sure that it was sky, and
only where the wave ran up and
curled over in foam almost within
their reach could they be sure that
it was water.
</p>

<p>
<q>The fairies have taken possession
of Dover,</q> Annette said. <q>I
hope they have not whisked the
steamer away. No; here it is.
We will stay on deck, Lawrence.
It is not cold.</q>
</p>

<p>
As they steamed out into the
channel, another scene of enchantment
<pb n='389'/><anchor id='Pg389'/>
took the place of the ordinary
view. As they withdrew from the
town, it showed only a crescent of
lights; lights clustered all over the
foamy water, and stars clustered in
openings of the fleecy clouds above,
so that they moved as if swimming
through constellations.
</p>

<p>
<q>I hardly know which is up and
which is down,</q> Lawrence said.
<q>Is Europe made of clay and rock,
like America?</q>
</p>

<p>
His wife was leaning on his arm,
and they stood looking over the
rail of the little steamer. <q>We
might come this way a hundred
times, and not see such a sight,</q> she
replied. <q>But there is land beyond.
That is France&mdash;that low,
dark line. In a few hours we shall
be in Paris. I shall be glad to rest
when we get there.</q>
</p>

<p>
But when they reached it, Paris
was as much too light as London
had been too dark. In the one
city a foe might stumble upon
them at any moment; in the other,
he might see them from afar. They
went to a dingy little hotel in the
old part of Paris, and stayed there
one day, trying to find rest, but in
vain. Every sound made their
hearts beat more quickly; every
glance and sudden step near them
sent the blood to their faces. Besides,
the quiet of the place afforded
them no distraction from their
thoughts. The noises in the narrow
street on which the hotel was
built were all shut out by the heavy
portal, and the quadrangle was as
still as a forest solitude. Ivy climbed
about the windows, a tiny fountain
overflowed and ran in a stream
across the pavement, and the only
persons who appeared were the
clergymen who were the chief patrons
of the house, and now and
then the universal waiter and servant
of servants, François, who
shuffled across the view, a napkin
over his arm, and his heavy head
dropped forward, so that only a
great ball of frowzy dark hair was
visible.
</p>

<p>
<q>We cannot stay here,</q> Annette
said, as they stood by the window
the first evening after their arrival.
<q>It is too much like a prison.</q>
She felt her husband start, and
made haste to add: <q>It is stupid,
and I fancy the air is not good.
Besides, Paris is too gay, if we go
out into the city. We do not want
gaiety, Lawrence. We want some
earnest employment for our time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We will go to Rome,</q> he said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Rome!</q> she hesitated. <q>One
meets everybody there,</q> she said;
<q>and there are so many idlers, too,
who have nothing to do but talk
of other people's affairs. Are you
sure you wish to go to Rome,
dear?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I must go! I have an object
in going there,</q> he exclaimed, excited
by the first show of even
slight opposition. <q>I stake all on
Rome. Whatever happens to me,
let it happen there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We will go, then,</q> she answered
soothingly. <q>And we may as
well set out to-night. Nothing is
unpacked, and we have three hours
before the train starts.</q>
</p>

<p>
He walked to and fro over the
stone floor of their little sitting-room,
which allowed only half a
dozen paces, so narrow was it.
<q>Three hours!</q> he muttered. <q>It
is too much! Cannot we go out?
There must be a church near.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; in France and in Italy
there is always a church near.</q>
</p>

<p>
They went into the fading sunset,
and soon found themselves entering
the old church of S. Etienne du
Mont. Inside, the pale gloaming
was changed to a richly-tinted
gloom that grew every moment
<pb n='390'/><anchor id='Pg390'/>
deeper. Here and there a lamp
marked some picture or shrine held
in special veneration, and far away
in the apse of the church, where the
shadows stretched off till they seemed
reaching out to eternity, burned
a single point of light, as small as
a star.
</p>

<p>
Annette clasped her hands over
her husband's arm, and leaned her
cheek close to his shoulder, as they
stood near the door and looked
at this little beacon. <q>O Lawrence!</q>
she whispered, <q>it is like
the light the mother sets in the
window to guide her children home
at night. O me! O me!</q> she
cried pitifully. <q>What is to become
of us!</q>
</p>

<p>
A crown of tapers burned about
the shrine where the body of S.
Geneviève had once lain, and an
old woman sat near by with her
prayer-book, presiding over a table
piled with tapers of different
lengths, her white cap showing like
a little heap of snow in the place.
</p>

<p>
<q>People buy tapers for a sou or
two, and set them by the shrine to
honor S. Geneviève and remind
her of their needs,</q> Annette said
softly as they approached this illuminated
space. <q>Would you like
to offer one?</q>
</p>

<p>
Lawrence Gerald had been wont
to mock somewhat at such observances
in the old time before life
had been shattered about him and
shown eternity between its gaps.
Now he went eagerly forward, selected
a taper, lighted it, and placed
it, whispering a prayer while his
fingers lingered on it. Annette
followed his example, placing her
offering beside his, and making her
request also.
</p>

<p>
As they were turning away, a
sacristan approached them from the
next chapel, and asked if they had
any article they would like to have
touched to the inside of the shrine.
Annette immediately gave him her
rosary, which he laid an instant
where the saint's body had lain.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ask him if I can put my hands
in,</q> Lawrence whispered.
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly you can!</q> she answered
with dignity, seeing the man
look rather curiously at him.
</p>

<p>
She held the lid open, and her
husband put both his hands in, and
instantly drew them back, his eyes
dilating and his color rising, as if
he had put them into fire.
</p>

<p>
They walked on past the grand
altar, and knelt in a nook by a confessional.
The daylight faded, and
the smouldering fires of the windows
went out in black and ashen
gray. But when no outer brightness
was left to enter and show the
glories of that house of God, the
lamps and tapers inside burned with
a clearer flame. They shed a faint
illumination through the vast twilight;
they spread a soft gilding up
the height of the clustered pillars,
and made tender the gloom brooding
in the roof that arched over their
capitals; they sparkled on the
crowns of the saints, and touched
marble faces with such a holy radiance
that a soul seemed to shine
through them.
</p>

<p>
A slight stir in the confessional
near them showed that a priest was
there. <q>Lawrence,</q> said Annette
suddenly, <q>may I go to confession?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wait a minute,</q> he answered.
<q>I will go first, and then you will
only need to say that you are my
wife.</q>
</p>

<p>
His tone revealed a bitter pain;
for unconsciously her question had
shown that there was no weight on
her conscience save that which he
had placed there, and that she was
more in need of consolation than
of forgiveness.
</p>

<pb n='391'/><anchor id='Pg391'/>

<p>
She sank on to her knees again.
<q>O my God!</q> she murmured, <q>has
it come to this, that I must enter
thy house without being able to
find comfort there?</q>
</p>

<p>
It was nearly half an hour before
Lawrence joined her, and they went
out together. <q>I have no wish to
go now,</q> she said when he offered
to wait while she went to confession.
<q>Besides, there is no time, if
we are to start to-night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know, Annette, what I
prayed for when I put the taper up
in honor of S. Geneviève?</q> her
husband asked when they were
again in the street. <q>I asked that
my mother may die in peace before
the month is out. That will be in
less than two weeks.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My poor Lawrence!</q> she sighed.
</p>

<p>
<q>And can you guess the reason
why I wish, above all things, to go
to Rome, and don't much care what
may happen after?</q> he went on.
<q>Of course you cannot. Well, I
want to receive absolution from the
Pope. I go to confession, and pour
out my story there, and I feel no
better for it; or, if I feel better
than I should without confession,
I am still not at peace. I
don't feel absolved. Yet I want to
go to confession every hour of the
day. I am like the Ancient Mariner,
who had to tell his story to every
one he met. I want to tell mine
to every priest in the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, dear Lawrence,</q> she said,
<q>that will not be so easy to compass.
Don't expect such a privilege too
confidently. You know we cannot
have an audience, because we cannot
go to him under false names.
If we could, his blessing would
satisfy you, would it not? But I
see no way, dear, though I would
not discourage you.</q>
</p>

<p>
For once her objections did not
irritate him. <q>I have been thinking
of it ever since we left America,</q>
he said; <q>and in one way or another
I shall succeed. Yes, his blessing
would be enough; and if there were
no other way, I could tell him my
real name. Now, we must make
haste. We have just time to reach
the station.</q>
</p>

<p>
How many hearts have quickened
in their beating as they travelled
that road, drawing near to Italy!
How many eyes have gazed eagerly
at that first cross, set aloft on the
mountain side, at the first shrine
of the Virgin Mother! And then
come the armies of poplars and
solemn cypresses.
</p>

<p>
<q>They look as if the dead warriors,
and prelates, and poets had
risen from their graves, and were
staring out over Italy to see
what their degenerate sons were
doing,</q> Annette said. <q>See how
tightly they hold their cold green
robes about them!</q>
</p>

<p>
Our travellers slept a few hours
at Turin, and, resuming their journey
before daylight, reached Florence
in the evening. And here,
having some time to wait, they
wandered out, hoping to find a
church open; but all were closed
at this hour. Presently they found
themselves standing on the bridge
of the Holy Trinity, listening to a
burst of wild music from many
bugles, played by some unseen
band. So loud and piercing was
the strain, the very stars appeared
to tremble as it went up. Then,
as suddenly as it rose, it dropped
again, and all was silent. The
city was quiet, and the Arno
gleamed across it like a jewelled
cestus across a sleeping breast.
Its waters seemed to have crystallized
into a purple enamel about the
golden reflections of the lights
along its banks, not a ripple showing
<pb n='392'/><anchor id='Pg392'/>
which way they flowed. Not
far away, another bridge spanned
the tide, its soft and dreamlike
arches set roundly over the answering
arches in the deeps below.
A small boat, faintly seen, shot underneath
this bridge, and disappeared.
It was a vision of Florence
as one sees it in history and
poetry.
</p>

<p>
The two strangers leaned on the
balustrade of the bridge, and, as
they gazed, felt the curse upon
them grow less sharp, as though
they were ghosts, and their crime
some old, old story, touched with
a sad splendor by poet and painter,
and half washed away by the tears
of pitying generations.
</p>

<p>
Standing there, silent and half
comforted, they became aware of
a low, murmurous sound of many
feet and voices; and then a long
line of white-robed figures appeared,
carrying torches. A bier was
borne aloft in their midst, what it
held covered with an embroidered
pall that glistened with gold. These
men recited prayers together as
they went, and the river and
bridge were for a moment bright
with the glare of their torches.
Then they disappeared, and a star-lighted
quiet reigned again over
the city of flowers.
</p>

<p>
Annette touched her husband's
arm, and they reluctantly turned
away from that spot where first
they had experienced a feeling of
peace.
</p>

<p>
And then, all night they plunged
deeper and deeper into Italy, till
morning and the Eternal City met
their faces, and dazzled them.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank God! I am in Rome at
last,</q> exclaimed Lawrence. <q>Now
nothing but death shall tear me
away from it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Yes, there it was! the crumbling,
stately city of the past, looking
as if it had just risen from the
bottom of the sea, after having
been submerged for centuries. It
was all a faded gold color, like
autumn leaves, and its narrow
streets were chilly, as though death
had breathed through them. But
its heights were warm and sunny,
and its dusky trees and hedges
were steeped in warmth, and over
its magnificent decay the sky was
fresh and blue, and the morning
sunshine flowed bountifully.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now,</q> said Mrs. Gerald, becoming
business-like at once, <q>we
must first engage an apartment,
and get our luggage into it. I
think I know Italian enough for
that, thanks to the songs I have
learned.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you propose singing an
aria to call a cab?</q> her husband
asked. <q>And will you engage an
apartment to the tune of <q>Hear
me, Norma</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
He smiled, and for a breath looked
like his old self. But the next
instant his face changed. The
thought of his mother was enough
to banish the smile for ever.
</p>

<p>
That thought had taken full possession
of him, filling him with a
terror, sorrow, and longing that
burned in his heart like consuming
fire. His flight had been made
with no feeling but fear for himself;
but with the first breath of the
air of the city of saints, he inhaled
a penitence which was without
taint of weakness.
</p>

<p>
While his wife, then, arranged
their affairs, and attended to the
preparation of their little <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>ménage</foreign>,
he took in hand the one work possible
for him&mdash;the study of his own
soul. This anguish for his mother,
whom he loved deeply, much
as he had wronged her, was like
a sword that cleft the selfish crust
of his nature. His whole life
<pb n='393'/><anchor id='Pg393'/>
came up before him with merciless
distinctness&mdash;all its ingratitude, its
pettishness, its littleness, its sinful
waste, its many downward steps
leading to the final plunge to ruin.
He saw, as if it were before him,
his mother's loving, patient face;
he heard, as if she were speaking
at his side, her sad and tremulous
voice; and more pathetic even
than her sorrow were the brief
moments of happiness he had given
her, her smile of pride in him,
her delight when he showed her
some mark of affection, her eager
anticipation of his wishes. As he
went back over this past, the self-pity,
the blindness, the false shame,
were stripped away from him, and
he saw himself as he was.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing but utter ruin could
have brought me to my senses,</q>
he said to his wife one day, when
he had been sitting for a long while
silent, gazing out at a little fountain
that sprang into air in a vain
effort to reach the laden orange-tree
that overshadowed it.
</p>

<p>
She made no reply, and he needed
none. She had let him go his
own ways, keeping watch, but never
interfering. She had nothing
to do for him now but wait and
see what sort of call he would
make on her.
</p>

<p>
He wandered from church to
church, and knelt at every shrine
in the city of shrines. Wherever
the signal lamp told that there
some troubled soul had found help,
he sent up his petition. He glanced
with indifferent eyes past the rich
marbles and gilding; but when a
face looked from marble or canvas
with an expression that touched
his heart, there he made his appeal.
The luxuries of life grew loathsome
to him; fashion and gaiety were to
him like a taunt of the evil one,
who had used them as lures for his
destruction. He hated the fineness
of his own clothes, the daintiness
of his food. None of the people
he saw seemed to him enviable,
save the poor monks in their coarse
brown robes, with their bare feet
thrust into rough sandals. In his
own house he lived like an ascetic.
</p>

<p>
Now and then he would rouse
himself from this stern and prolonged
examen to think of his wife.
She had claims on him which, perhaps,
he was forgetting.
</p>

<p>
<q>You poor child!</q> he said, <q>we
are not in India, that you should
immolate yourself over my dead
hopes. What can I do for you. I
would free you, if I could.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are not to think of me,</q>
she replied quietly. <q>It is God
who now commands you to think
of yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes!</q> he exclaimed, <q>I have
made my own instruments of torture.
Having thought of myself
when it was a sin, I am forced to
think of myself when it is a torment.
And I escape that thought
only to remember my victims.
Annette, but one day is left of the
four weeks. O my mother! if
space could be annihilated, and I
could be with you till it is over!
If I could but know what has happened,
what will happen, to her!</q>
</p>

<p>
He had spent the whole day in a
church near by, sometimes praying
before an altar, sometimes gazing
at the pictures, in search of a divine
meaning that might be hidden in
them; but oftener, withdrawn to a
dusky nook where only a single
lamp burned before a head crowned
with thorns, he gave himself up to
grief.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is useless to wish and repine,</q>
his wife replied sadly.
<q>That is one of the weaknesses we
must cure ourselves of. Since it is
only a torment to imagine what
<pb n='394'/><anchor id='Pg394'/>
may be taking place at home, let
us try to banish the thought, leaving
all in the hands of God. And
now, Lawrence, do you know that
you have eaten nothing to-day?
When you stay so long again, I
shall go after you. In Rome, at this
season, it is dangerous to allow the
strength to fail. You will soon be
ill, if you go on fasting so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what matter if I should?</q>
he asked.
</p>

<p>
The wife waited till the servant
had placed the dinner on the table
and gone out before she spoke, and
the moment of consideration had
made her resolve on a stern answer,
however willingly she would
have given a tender one. She had
long since discovered that her husband
was one of those whom the
flatteries of affection enervate instead
of stimulating, and she was
not sure enough of a radical change
having taken place in him to yield
to her own impulse to soothe and
persuade when reproof might be
more effectual.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of all the gifts which God has
bestowed on you,</q> she said, <q>you
have cast away every one but life;
but with that life you may yet
atone, and become a blessing to
the world. It is your duty to
watch over the only means left you
of making reparation.</q>
</p>

<p>
He did not show the slightest
displeasure at her reproof. On the
contrary, there seemed to be something
in it almost pleasant to him.
Perhaps the suggestion that he
might yet be a blessing in the
world, incredible as that appeared,
inspired him with an undefined
hope. He dwelt thoughtfully on
her words in a way that was becoming
habitual to him whenever
she spoke with peculiar seriousness,
and Annette, seeing his humility,
was half sorry for having put it to
the test. With a confused impulse
to give him at least some pitiful
and perilous comfort, she poured a
glass of wine, and placed it by him,
well aware that for weeks he had
not drunk any.
</p>

<p>
He put it away decidedly. <q>I
would as soon drink poison, Annette,</q>
he said reproachfully. <q>I
did not think that you would offer
it to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
She withdrew the glass immediately,
ashamed of her weakness,
and making a hasty apology. <q>If
I had known you had made any
resolution on the subject, I would
not have offered it,</q> she said.
<q>Forgive me! I never will again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! there was no resolution
needed,</q> he said. <q>If you had
been burned almost to death once,
would you need to resolve not to
go into the fire again? I fancy the
sight of it would be enough. But
I think I may promise never again
to take wine, unless I should be
commanded to by some one who
knows better than I.</q>
</p>

<p>
His wife did not reply. This
was a degree of asceticism which
she had not expected and was
afraid to trust. She had expected
him to refuse indulgences, but not
consolations. Indeed, she did not
now understand her husband, and
her hope of his redemption was but
a trembling one. This self-denial
might be only another illustration
of that instability which rushes
from one extreme to the other,
only to return to its first excess.
</p>

<p>
We all know how to rely on that
natural firmness, which the sad experience
of mankind has shown to
be never so strong but it may fail
at any hour; but the supernatural
strength of the naturally weak who
have cast themselves on God often
finds no doubting. We miss the
firm lips, the steady eyes, the undaunted
<pb n='395'/><anchor id='Pg395'/>
brow&mdash;those signs of a
resolute soul which the pagan shares
with the Christian&mdash;and we forget
that the tremulous mouth we
distrust has sighed out its prayer
to Him who is mighty, the shrinking
eyes have looked upon the hills
whence help cometh, the timid
brow has been hidden beneath the
wing of an angel guardian, and
that, faltering though the soul may
have been, and may be again, the
shield of God is before it, and it
can be conquered by no human
strength.
</p>

<p>
This soul had made such an advance
as to be conscious of some
such fortitude infused into it.
Lawrence Gerald had no fear of
falling into his former sins. He
might have the misery of seeing the
destruction he had brought on
others, might be himself destroyed
by a sorrow and remorse too great
to bear; but he had an immovable
conviction that he could never
again return to his old ways nor
commit any grave transgression.
It was this conviction which had
made him say that nothing but destruction
could have brought him
to his senses.
</p>

<p>
<q>I like that church you took me
to this morning,</q> he said, walking
slowly up and down the room.
<q>The others, many of them, seem
to me fit only for the happy. They
are all display and confusion and
sight-seers, with scarcely a nook in
them where a person in trouble can
hide. They do not give me any
impression of sacredness. But this
one is so quiet and sober, and there
are no people standing about with
guide-books, talking aloud while
you are praying or trying to pray.
Then there is a little place, half
chapel, half vestibule, between the
church and the sacristy, where a
side door enters the church, with
an Ecce Homo in a little shrine;
and there you can be quite private,
without any one staring at you. I
shall go to that church altogether.</q>
</p>

<p>
The church he spoke of was Santa
Maria della Pace.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is Our Lady of Peace,</q> his
wife said, <q>and was built to commemorate
the peace of Christendom.
I thought it would please
you. Surely some special consolation
and tranquillity should linger
about a temple built and cemented
with such an intention. I like it,
too, better than most others we
have visited, though it is not so
splendid as many.</q>
</p>

<p>
She did not tell him that, after
having left his side, when the early
Mass was over, she had lingered in
the church till it was closed at
noon, not to watch him, but to be
near him. Requesting the sacristan
to withdraw the curtain covering
the Four Sibyls of Raphael, she
had seated herself before the chapel
opposite, and divided her attention
between that matchless vision and
the unquiet figure that moved about
the church. Once he had come
near, but without seeming aware of
her presence, and, standing at her
side, had gazed with her. And
while he gazed, she had seen the
trouble in his face grow still for a moment.
The noble serenity of that
composition, so soothing to eyes
wearied by the sprawling magnificence
of Michael Angelo and the
ever-present, dishevelled, wind-tossed
figures of Bernini, lifted his soul
to a higher plane. Even when he
sighed and turned away, as if not
willing to allow himself the pleasure
of looking at so much beauty, he
carried something of that spirit of
harmony with him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Lawrence,</q> his wife said presently,
when she had borne his restless
promenade as long as she
<pb n='396'/><anchor id='Pg396'/>
could, <q>I know that you did not
sleep any last night. I wish that
you would take a powder that I will
give you, and try to sleep now.
You look worn out. Lie down on
the sofa here, and I will keep everything
quiet.</q>
</p>

<p>
He shook his head. <q>I would
rather not take anything to make
me sleep, Ninon. And to-night I
would not sleep, if I could. But I
will lie down here a little while; for
I am tired, now I think of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
He threw himself on the sofa,
and she placed a screen before him,
and closed the window near his
head, so that even the soft plashing
of the fountain was shut out,
and the small notes of birds that
twittered in the great pine-tree in
the garden. And after a little while,
finding him still restless, she went
to the piano, and sang how God
sent Elias to reassure and comfort
a doubting and tempted soul. The
notes flowed with a soothing murmur
from under her fingers, and
her voice, no longer the brilliant,
ringing tones he had taken such
pride in, was so low it might be a
spirit singing:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

</lg>

</quote>

<p>
Ending, she listened a moment,
then stole across the room, and
looked behind the screen. Lawrence
was sleeping, with his head
thrown back, his beautiful profile
and moist, dark curls thrown out
strongly by the garnet cushions and
pillow.
</p>

<p>
She went to the window, and
seated herself on a footstool near
it, wrapping the long red curtains
about her, and leaning against the
wall. The sculptured marble of
that stately <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salon</foreign> was cold against
her cheek; a flock of doves wheeling
about over the garden caught
some last rays of the sun on their
wings, and threw them down over
her, so that little white wings seemed
to be fluttering all around the
room; the casement slipped open,
and the sound of tossing waters
and twittering birds again became
audible; but the watcher there
took no note of these things. She
was looking at the figure stretched
on the sofa, and thinking that in all
Rome there was no ruin so mournful
and so terrible. He was like
some fair column stricken from out
a temple and cast aside into the
dust; not touched by the hand of
time, that, with its slow to-and-fro
of days and nights, and seasons and
years, lulls all the pain of decay to
sleep, but broken and scathed, as
if by lightning.
</p>

<p>
While she looked, he stirred, and
opened his eyes; and the sympathetic
pain with which she saw how
he came back to a consciousness of
his position almost drew an outcry
from her. The first tranquil, half-wondering
glance which saw, instead
of the familiar surroundings
of his childhood and youth, that
immense room, with its profuse
hangings and painted ceiling, and
the long windows opening like
doors; then the brief flash of startled
questioning; lastly, the anguish
of full recollection.
</p>

<p>
<q>O my God! my God!</q> he
exclaimed, and hid his face in the
cushions again.
</p>

<p>
She was at his side in a moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us go out for a long drive,
Lawrence,</q> she said. <q>There will
be a bright moonlight to-night, and
we can see so many places by it.
Come! I will send for a carriage at
once. There is nothing else for
either of us to do.</q>
</p>

<pb n='397'/><anchor id='Pg397'/>

<p>
Nothing could have shown more
clearly the change in Lawrence
Gerald than his manner of receiving
this proposal. Instead of expressing
at once his aversion, and reproaching
his wife that she could
believe it possible for him to go
sight-seeing at such a time, he stopped
to consider if what she thought
best might not be best, however it
should seem to him.
</p>

<p>
<q>You must think for me now,
Annette,</q> he said with a sort of
despair. <q>You know I do not wish
to seek pleasure nor distraction;
but I suppose I must live.</q>
</p>

<p>
She sent for a carriage at once,
and they went out under the full
moon that was beginning to replace,
with its pearly southern lights and
northern shadows, the fading cross-lights
of the sun. They drove to
the Colosseum, not yet despoiled of
its sacred emblems, and, kneeling
there in the dust, made the stations
in their own way. Annette named
each one as they reached it, then
left her husband to make his meditation,
or to utter the ejaculation
that started up from his tormented
heart, as sharp as a blade from its
sheath.
</p>

<p>
At last they stood together by
the crucifix, with the moonlight falling
on them and through the great
arches in a silvery rain.
</p>

<p>
Annette saw her husband wipe
his forehead, though the night was
cool. He breathed heavily, and
looked at the earth beneath his
feet, as if he saw through it, and
beheld the martyr lying where he
fell centuries before.
</p>

<p>
<q>O my dear!</q> she said, <q>I
know that there is no lion like remorse.
But is it no comfort to you
that you are not alone?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is both a comfort and a
pain,</q> he answered gently. <q>I
should be desolate without you, and
I should have done something desperate,
perhaps, if I had been alone.
You must understand my gratitude
and my regret without expecting
me to express them. I cannot
speak. I know I have wronged
you bitterly, and that you are an
angel of goodness to me; but I can
say no more about it. If I were at
my mother's feet this moment, I
should be speechless. I cannot
pray even. I acknowledge the justice
of God, and will endure whatever
he sends. That is all I can
say.</q>
</p>

<p>
He had forced himself to speak,
she perceived, with a great effort.
The season of complaints and outcries
had gone past, and he had entered
on the way of silence.
</p>

<p>
They went out, and left the ruin
to its solemn tenants&mdash;the gliding
shadows, which might be the troubled
ghosts of the slayers, and the
floating lights, which might be the
glorified souls of the slain, visiting
the loved spot where they had seen
the heavens open for them.
</p>

<p>
The streets were nearly deserted
when the two returned to them, their
horses walking. They stopped at
the fountain of Trevi, leaned awhile
on the stone rail, and watched the
streams that burst in snowy foam
all along the front.
</p>

<p>
<q>What a heap of coals and ashes
Rome would be without her fountains!</q>
Annette said. <q>It would
be like a family of patriarchs where
no children are seen. And yet the
waters do not always seem to me
so childish. Theirs is the youth
and freshness of angels. See how
triumphant they look! They have
been a long while in the dark, till
they may have despaired of ever
seeing the sun again. It is the way
of souls, Lawrence. They walk in
darkness and pain, they cannot see
their way, and they sometimes
<pb n='398'/><anchor id='Pg398'/>
doubt if light any longer exists.
And at last they burst from their
prison, and find themselves in the
city of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> he said, <q>but they have
not sinned; they have only suffered.
I have always thought, Annette,
that the saints have the
easier life. You know we are told
that the way of the transgressor is
hard.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But the saints did not choose
that life because it was the easier,</q>
she replied. <q>They gave no
thought to such a reward, but it
was bestowed on them; and probably,
when they chose, the other
way seemed the easier, in spite of
what the preacher says. The person
who chooses a good life because
it is the easier will never persevere
in it; for the devil will always
persuade him that he has made a
mistake, and, since he chose from
a selfish motive, God will owe him
no help. The saints took what
was hard, and what seemed the
hardest because it was right, and left
the consequences with God; and
they had their reward. The sinner
takes what seems the easiest, and
thinks only of himself; and he, too,
has his reward. Do not the waters
look lovely? They are so fresh and
new! How beautiful an image it is
to compare divine grace to a fountain!</q>
</p>

<p>
They drove on through the
town, across the bridge of S. Angelo,
and saw the angel sheathing
his sword&mdash;or was he unsheathing
it?&mdash;against the sky, and, leaving
their carriage at the entrance of
the piazza of S. Peter's, walked
across it to that majestic temple,
which, more than any other, and at
that hour more than ever, seemed
worthy of the Spouse of the Spirit.
Golden and white, the mystical
flood of moonlight veiled it, rippling
along its colonnades, glittering
in its fountains, setting a pavement
of chalcedony across the piazza
and up the wide ascent, and
trembling round the dome that
swelled upward like a breast full
with the divine milk and honey
with which the church nourishes
her children.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence stopped near the obelisk.
</p>

<p>
<q>The first question the church
asked of me when I was brought
before her, an infant,</q> he said,
<q>was what I had come to ask of
her, and my sponsors answered for
me, Faith. Now once again she
asks the same question.</q>
</p>

<p>
He was silent a moment, looking
up at the church, but with eyes
that saw only the sacred Mother.
Tears rolled down his face, and his
lips trembled; but there was no
sign of that desperate passion which
had so worn him. <q>I ask for forgiveness
and perseverance,</q> he said.
</p>

<p>
She observed that he did not ask
for peace.
</p>

<p>
He went forward to the steps,
and knelt there; and as he wept
and prayed, his wife heard ever the
same petition that God would have
mercy on his mother, that in some
way he would spare her the blow
that threatened to fall upon her,
and that she might know how he
loved her and mourned his ingratitude.
</p>

<p>
Annette withdrew from her husband,
and paced to and fro not far
away. She, too, had a mother who
was about to be stricken with grief
on her account, and whom she
might never again see in life.
</p>

<p>
She had almost forgotten her
husband and how time was flying,
when she heard his voice at her side.
</p>

<p>
<q>My poor Annette, I am killing
you,</q> he said. <q>Come home.
See! the day is breaking.</q>
</p>

<pb n='399'/><anchor id='Pg399'/>

<p>
The east was, indeed, growing
pale with the early dawn, and the
western colonnade was throwing
long shadows as the moon declined.
It was time for them to return.
Chilled and exhausted, they entered
their carriage, and were driven
home.
</p>

<p>
The dawn of that same day, when
in its course the sun rose from the
Atlantic, and brightened the New
England shore, saw Mrs. Gerald
and Honora Pembroke go to early
Mass together.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse had visited them
the morning before, and requested
them to go to communion that
day, and pray for themselves, their
friends, and for his intention.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have a difficult duty to perform,</q>
he said, <q>and I want all the
help I can get. So make yourselves
as saintly as possible, my
dear friends. Confess and prepare
yourselves for holy communion as
if it were to be your last, and pray
with all your strength, and do not
allow a single smallest venial sin to
touch you all day.</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse often asked them
to pray for his intention, and all
they observed in this was his unusual
earnestness. It had the effect of
making them also unusually earnest
in their devotion. Mrs. Gerald
was, indeed, so absorbed that she
failed to notice that when Honora
came from the priest's house, where
she had been just before evening,
she did not look quite well. F.
Chevreuse had requested her to
come there from her school, before
going home, and she had been with
him nearly an hour.
</p>

<p>
<q>So you have been to confession,</q>
Mrs. Gerald said, arranging the
tray for their tea. <q>I thought we
would go there together this evening.</q>
</p>

<p>
She spoke in a very gentle, almost
absent way; for she had been
saying, as she went about, all the
short prayers she could remember
to the Blessed Virgin, and would
resume them presently.
</p>

<p>
<q>So we will go together,</q> Miss
Pembroke replied. <q>But I wanted
to see F. Chevreuse this afternoon.</q>
</p>

<p>
She seated herself in a shady
corner of the room, and opened her
prayer-book; but it trembled so in
her hand that she was forced to lay
it aside, and pretend to be occupied
with her rosary instead. Now and
then she stole a glance at her companion,
and saw with thankfulness
that she was entirely occupied with
her devotions. As she went about,
preparing with dainty care their simple
meal, her lips were moving;
and sometimes she would pause a
moment to bless herself, or to kiss
the crucifix suspended from her
neck, or to dwell on some sweet
thought she had found hidden in a
little prayer, like a blossom under
a leaf.
</p>

<p>
And later in the evening, when
the two returned from the priest's
house, there was nothing to attract
attention in Miss Pembroke's manner;
for they sat reading and meditating
till it was bed-time. It was
their custom, since they lived alone,
to prepare thus strictly for the reception
of the Holy Eucharist.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald stood a minute before
the embers of the dying fire,
when they were ready to go up-stairs,
the hand she had stretched
for the bed-candle resting on the
edge of the mantel-piece near it.
<q>How peaceful we are here, Honora!</q>
she said in her soft way,
yet rather suddenly.
</p>

<p>
Miss Pembroke was bending to
push the few remaining coals back,
and her reply was indistinct, yet
sounded like an affirmative.
</p>

<pb n='400'/><anchor id='Pg400'/>

<p>
<q>We have so much to be grateful
for,</q> Mrs. Gerald went on. <q>I do
not think that we could be more
comfortable. I am sure that greater
riches would disturb me. Indeed,
I never wanted riches, except for
Lawrence; and now he does not
need them. I can truly say that I
have all I desire.</q>
</p>

<p>
Miss Pembroke did not reply
nor look up. She only stooped
lower, and stretched her hands out
over the coals, as if to warm them.
Yet the two had always been so in
harmony that her silence seemed
to be assent.
</p>

<p>
<q>F. Chevreuse spoke beautifully
to me to-night,</q> Mrs. Gerald continued,
still lingering. <q>He kept
me some time talking after I had
made my confession; and, what is
unusual with him, he spoke of himself.
He said that all the favors
he has to ask of God are for others;
but that when he comes to pray for
himself, he can only say, <q>Amen.</q>
Now and then, he said, he thinks to
ask some special favor; but when
he lifts his eyes to heaven, only one
word comes: <q>Amen! amen!</q> I
did not understand, while he spoke,
how much it meant; but I have
been thinking it over since I came
home, and I see that the word may
include all that a Christian need
say.</q>
</p>

<p>
A murmured <q>Yes!</q> came from
Honora, who turned her head aside
that the candle might not shine in
her face. <q>And now, dear Mrs.
Gerald, since we are to rise early,
we had better go to bed. Can I do
anything for you? Is there anything
to do to-night?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing, thank you, dear!</q>
</p>

<p>
They went up-stairs together,
and, when they parted, Miss Pembroke
embraced her friend with unusual
tenderness. <q>May you have
a good night's sleep!</q> she said;
and, in the anguish of her heart,
could almost have added, <q>And
may you never wake!</q>
</p>

<p>
For F. Chevreuse had wisely
judged it best to prepare her to
sustain her friend when the hour of
trial should come; and Honora,
better than any other perhaps, understood
what that shock would
be.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go out in the morning and dismiss
your school for the day,</q> the
priest had said to her. <q>Then return
home immediately, and make
some excuse for it. You will
easily be able to plead a headache,
I fancy. Tell Mrs. Gerald that F.
O'Donovan is coming to see her, so
that she may not go out. And
pray, my child, pray! What else
is there for any of us to do in this
terrible world but pray?</q>
</p>

<p>
Honora was obliged to make her
excuses before going to school, for
Mrs. Gerald at length noticed her
altered looks, and almost insisted
on dismissing the school for her.
But she would not allow that.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall feel better to go out
than to sit in the house waiting,</q>
she said, quite truly. <q>But I will
come back at once. Pray do not
be anxious about me. You know
I am strong and healthy.</q>
</p>

<p>
When she returned, she found
that Mrs. Gerald had, with motherly
affection, made every preparation
for her comfort. A deep sofa was
pushed into a shady corner of the
sitting-room, pillows and a shawl
were laid ready, and, as she entered
the room, she perceived the pleasant
odor of pennyroyal, their favorite
remedy for colds and headaches.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald set down the steaming
cup she held, and began to remove
her young friend's bonnet
and shawl. <q>I thought you would
rather lie down here than go up
<pb n='401'/><anchor id='Pg401'/>
stairs by yourself,</q> she said. <q>I
will keep everything quiet.</q>
</p>

<p>
Honora submitted to be made an
invalid of, since this tender soul
could have no greater pleasure than
to relieve suffering; allowed herself
to be assisted to the sofa; let Mrs.
Gerald arrange the pillows under
her head and cover her with the
shawl; then drank obediently the
remedy offered her. But all the
while her heart was sinking with an
agony of apprehension, and she listened
breathlessly for a step which
was to bring doom to this unconscious
victim.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now what else can I do for
you, dear?</q> her nurse asked, looking
vainly to see what had not been
done.
</p>

<p>
Honora answered, <q>Nothing</q>;
but, recollecting that something
might be needed, if not for her,
added, <q>You might place a glass
of water and the camphor-bottle
here where I can reach them.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald brought them, from
the mere pleasure of serving. <q>But
you must not drink the water, for
you are to be kept warm,</q> she said.
<q>Your hands are quite cold now.
And, you know, camphor never
does you any good.</q>
</p>

<p>
She was about turning away
when Honora took her hand, and
detained her. She dared not look
up, but she held the hand close to
her cheek on the pillow. <q>Dear
friend,</q> she said in a stifled voice,
<q>it sometimes almost hurts me to
remember how good and kind you
have always been to me. I hope I
have never seemed ungrateful; I
have never felt so. But in future I
want to be more than ever to you.
Let me be your daughter, and live
with you always. I do not want to
go away with any one else.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My daughter!</q> said Mrs. Gerald,
full of loving surprise and pleasure;
and stooped to leave a kiss
on the girl's forehead.
</p>

<p>
<q>And now, dear mother,</q> said
Honora, <q>do not fancy that I am
very sick. In an hour, all will be
over.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald smiled at this promise
of sudden cure.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then I will leave you quiet a
little while, and go out to water my
plants. The seeds have come up
which I sowed in the tracks my
other two children made; and in a
day or two, when Lawrence and
Annette come home, their footprints
will be quite green.</q>
</p>

<p>
She spoke with a gentle gaiety, for
she was happy. So much affection
had been shown her, she seemed to
be of such help and value to those
she loved best, that life assumed for
her an aspect of spring and; youth,
and a gladness long unknown to
her rose up in her heart.
</p>

<p>
As she left the room, Honora
looked eagerly after her, raising
herself on her elbow, as soon as
she was out of sight, and listening
toward the door. When she heard
her step on the veranda, she started
off the sofa, and ran to look out
through a blind into the garden.
Mrs. Gerald was on her knees by
the precious tracks, which she had
carefully enclosed with slender
pegs of wood, and was sprinkling
with water the tiny blades of green
that grew thickly inside. A soft
and tender smile played round her
lips, and the wrinkles that pain
and anxiety sometimes drew in her
face were all smoothed away.
The spring morning hung over her
like a benediction, silent and
bright, not a breath of wind stirring;
and in that secluded street,
with its cottages and embowering
trees, she was as safe from public
observation as she would have
been in the country.
</p>

<pb n='402'/><anchor id='Pg402'/>

<p>
Honora glanced at the clock.
It wanted five minutes of ten.
</p>

<p>
<q>Five minutes more of happiness!</q>
she murmured, and, from
faintness, sank on her knees before
the window, looking out still with
her eyes fixed on that quiet, bending
figure.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald stretched her hand
and slowly made the sign of the
cross over each one of those precious
footprints. <q>May all their
steps be toward heaven!</q> she
whispered. <q>May angels guard
them now and for ever, and may
the blessings of the poor and the
suffering spring up wherever they go,
like these flowers, in their path.</q>
</p>

<p>
She rose and stood looking off
into distance, tears of earnest feeling
glistening in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Two minutes longer!</q> murmured
Honora, who felt as if the
room were swimming around her,
so that she had to grasp the window-ledge
for support. She could
not see, but she heard a step on
the sidewalk, and, though it was
more measured than usual, there
was no possibility of mistaking it.
Only one step would come in that
way and stop at their gate this
morning. She heard F. O'Donovan's
voice, and presently the two
came into the entry together.
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps you had better come
into the parlor,</q> Mrs. Gerald was
saying. <q>Honora is lying down
in there. She has a bad headache
this morning.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nevertheless, we will go in and
see her,</q> was the reply.
</p>

<p>
Miss Pembroke started up, frightened
at her own weakness. It
would never do to fail now, when
all the strength she could show
would be needed. She had only
time to seat herself on the sofa
when they entered the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear child! why did you
not lie still?</q> Mrs. Gerald exclaimed.
<q>I am sure F. O'Donovan
would excuse you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I would rather sit up, if you
will come and sit by me,</q> Honora
answered; and, taking Mrs. Gerald's
hands, drew her down to the sofa,
and sat there holding her in a half
embrace.
</p>

<p>
The lady noticed with surprise
that no greeting passed between
the priest and Honora, and that he
had not uttered a word of sympathy
for her illness, nor, indeed,
scarcely glanced at her. He went
to the window, and opened one of
the blinds.
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me to have a ray of sunshine
in the room,</q> he said. <q>Why
should we shut it out? It is like
divine love in a sorrowful world.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald had hardly time to
notice this somewhat unusual freedom
of manner on the part of F.
O'Donovan, for, as he came and
seated himself near her, she was
struck by the paleness and gravity
of his face.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you ill? Has anything
happened?</q> she asked hastily; but
he saw that in her anxiety there
was no thought of danger to herself.
It was a friendly solicitude for him;
and she instantly glanced at Honora,
as if connecting her illness
with his altered appearance. That
her young friend might have some
cause of trouble seemed to her
quite possible; for she had never
been able to disabuse her mind of
the belief that Honora had become
more interested in Mr. Schöninger
than she would own, and that she
had never recovered entirely from
the shock of his disgrace.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have great news to tell you,</q>
said F. O'Donovan. <q>Mr. Schöninger
is proved innocent, and will
immediately be set at liberty.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How glad I am!</q> exclaimed
<pb n='403'/><anchor id='Pg403'/>
Mrs. Gerald, who immediately believed
that she understood all.
<q>But how is it known?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The real criminal has confessed,</q>
the priest went on; <q>and the
confession and the circumstances
are all of a sort to excite our deepest
compassion. For it was not a
deliberate crime, but only one of
those steps which a man who has
once consented to walk in the
wrong path seems compelled to
take. The poor fellow was deceived,
and led on as all sinners are.
He was in pecuniary difficulties,
and yielded to a temptation to take
F. Chevreuse's money, intending to
repay it. The rest followed almost
as a matter of course. Mother
Chevreuse defended her son's property,
and the poor sinner had to
secure what he had risked so much
to obtain, and escape the disgrace
of detection. Others were approaching,
and he was desperate.
He gave an unlucky push, with no
intention but to free himself, and
the devil looked out for the result.
But, if you could know how entirely
that poor soul has repented, not
only the fatal step in which his
errors ended, but every smallest
fault that led to it, you would have
only pity for him. Mother Chevreuse
died a good and holy woman,
full of years and good works, and
perhaps her death will be the cause
of one man being a saint. He
promises everything for the future,
and that with a fervor which no
one can doubt. He acknowledges
the justice of any contumely and
suffering and loss which may befall
him. The only thought too hard
for him to bear is that of the sorrow
he has brought on his own family.
If he could suffer alone, he
would not complain; he would
suffer tenfold, if it were possible,
to spare those he loves.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald had listened with
intense interest to this story, and
when it was ended she drew a long
breath. <q>Poor man!</q> she sighed.
<q>Has he a wife?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; he has a wife who is all
devotion to him, and who will follow
him to the last. She will never
be separated from him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Will she go to prison with him?
Will she be allowed to do that?</q>
Mrs. Gerald asked in surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! it is not a question of imprisonment,</q>
the priest replied.
<q>He has escaped, and will probably
never be taken. His confession
was written, sealed, and entrusted
to a priest, to be opened at a certain
time. It was opened this
morning.</q>
</p>

<p>
The two watched Mrs. Gerald
with trembling anxiety as she sat
a moment with downcast eyes,
musing over this strange story.
Honora did not dare to breathe or
stir, lest she should loosen the
thunderbolt that hung suspended
over their heads, ready to drop,
and the priest was inwardly praying
for wisdom to speak the right
word.
</p>

<p>
<q>I hope he has no mother,</q>
Mrs. Gerald said, without looking
up.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is the hardest part of all,</q>
said F. O'Donovan. <q>He has a
mother. It is that which renders
his remorse so terrible. But fortunately
she is a Christian woman,
who will know how to bend to the
will of God, and leave her afflictions
at his feet. She will be comforted
by the thought that her son
is a sincere penitent, and is by this
awful lesson put for ever on his
guard against sins which might
otherwise have seemed to him
trivial.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! but think of her responsibility!</q>
exclaimed Mrs. Gerald,
<pb n='404'/><anchor id='Pg404'/>
raising her eyes quickly. <q>Think
of her remorse and fear when she
looks back on her training of that
child, and thinks that all his faults
and crimes may be laid at her door.
I know a mother's heart, F. O'Donovan,
and I tell you there will
be no comfort for that mother.
You cannot have seen her. Where
is she? I would like to go to
her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She does not yet know,</q> replied
the priest, almost in a whisper,
and stopped there, though
other words seemed about to follow.
</p>

<p>
She gazed at him in surprise,
and her look began to grow strange.
She only looked intently, but said
nothing; and in that dreadful
silence Honora Pembroke's arm
closed tightly about her waist, and
her breath trembled on the mother's
paling cheek.
</p>

<p>
<q>Cast yourself into the arms
of God!</q> exclaimed F. O'Donovan.
<q>Do not think! Do not fear nor
look abroad. Hide yourself in the
bosom of God! Sin and sorrow
are but passing clouds, but heaven
and hope and peace are eternal!</q>
</p>

<p>
Those beautiful violet eyes that
had wept so many tears, now dry and
dilating, were fixed upon him, and
the face changed slowly. One
wave of deep red had flown over it
and sunk, and from pale it had
grown deathly white, and over that
whiteness had stolen a faint gray
shade.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mother! mother! speak!</q> cried
Honora Pembroke, weeping; but
the form she clasped was rigid, and
the face was beginning to have a
blank, unnatural expression.
</p>

<p>
<q>Live for your son's sake!</q> said
F. O'Donovan, taking in his her
cold hands&mdash;<q>live to see his repentance,
to see him win the forgiveness
of the world and of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
But that blankness overspread
her face, and the light in her fixed
eyes grew more dim.
</p>

<p>
The priest stood up, still holding
strongly one of her hands, and with
his other made the sign of the
cross over her, giving with it the
final absolution. Then he seated
himself beside her, and, while Honora
fell at her feet, put his arm
around the rigid form, and touched
the cheeks with his warm, magnetic
hand, and pleaded tenderly and with
tears, as if she had been his own
mother, now a word of human love,
now a word of divine hope; and
suddenly he stopped, and Honora,
with her face hidden in Mrs. Gerald's
lap, heard him exclaim, <q>Depart,
Christian soul, out of the
body, in the name of the Father
who created thee, in the name of
the Son who redeemed thee, and in
the name of the Holy Ghost who
has sanctified thee.</q>
</p>

<p>
She started up with a faint cry,
and saw that Mrs. Gerald's head
had dropped sideways on to her
shoulder, her eyes were half-closed,
and her relaxing form was sinking
backward, supported by F. O'Donovan.
</p>

<p>
How it happened she did not
know, but almost at the same instant
Mrs. Macon entered the room
followed by a doctor, and to Honora's
confused sense it seemed as
though helpers were all about and
she was separated from her friend.
She heard F. O'Donovan's voice
repeating the prayers for the dead,
and presently the weeping responses
of the servant, but she was
powerless to join them.
</p>

<p>
She roused herself only when she
heard the priest speak her name.
<q>Did I make any mistake? Did I
do well, do you think?</q> he asked
anxiously. <q>I did not know any
better way.</q>
</p>

<pb n='405'/><anchor id='Pg405'/>

<p>
Honora opened her eyes and
looked about.
</p>

<p>
<q>There was no better way,</q> she
said. <q>The result would have
been the same in any case, and she
suffered only a minute.</q>
</p>

<p>
Tears were swimming in his fine
eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>She has, indeed, hidden herself
in the bosom of God, where no
harm can reach her, and it is best
so. We can see that it is most
merciful for her. But for that unhappy
son....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do not name him!</q> exclaimed
Miss Pembroke, shuddering. <q>I
cannot think of him without abhorrence!
See what ruin he has
wrought wherever he has been.
What has escaped him? Nothing!
Do you, can you, believe there is
hope for one whose soul is such an
abyss of weakness and selfishness?
He has stripped from me my dearest
friends; he has smitten those
who loved him best....</q>
</p>

<p>
She stopped, half from the bitter
weeping that choked her words,
half because the priest had laid his
checking hand on her arm.
</p>

<p>
<q>The silence of death is in the
house,</q> he said gently. <q>Do not
disturb it by anger. Leave Lawrence
Gerald to the lashes of his
guilty conscience. Believe me, it
will be punishment enough. Forgive
him, and pray for him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not yet! I cannot yet!</q> she
protested. <q>He has been forgiven
too much. But I will say no more.
I am sorry I should have spoken
so in <emph>her</emph> home.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Come out into the air of the
garden a little while; it will refresh
you,</q> the priest urged. <q>I
must go directly to F. Chevreuse,
but I will return. He went to
Mrs. Ferrier more than an hour
ago, and was to wait there for me
or come this way to learn the result.
Poor F. Chevreuse! he is
sorely tried. Everything rests on
him. Don't sit here in the dark
any longer. Come!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You had better go, Miss Pembroke.
You can do nothing here,</q>
Mrs. Macon said to her.
</p>

<p>
She went out and hid herself
in a little arbor that had been a
favorite retreat of Mrs. Gerald's
on warm summer days, and sitting
there, too stunned for weeping,
now that the first burst of tears
was dried, tried to recollect and
realize what had happened.
</p>

<p>
As she sat there she heard
presently the trampling of horses
and the roll of a carriage, and
mechanically leaned forward to see
who was passing, but without in the
least caring. The bright bays and
the sparkling harness were very
familiar to her eyes, and she saw
that Mrs. Ferrier herself was in
the carriage. The woman's face
was red and swollen with weeping
and excitement, and as she passed
the cottage she put up her hand
as if she would have shut it from
her sight. Evidently her interview
with F. Chevreuse had been
a stormy one, and had left her in
anything but a charitable frame of
mind.
</p>

<p>
Miss Pembroke looked indifferently
at first, but a moment after
she rose and took a step forward
to see better; for F. Chevreuse
and F. O'Donovan had appeared
in the street in front of the carriage
and stopped it, and the elder
priest was speaking sternly to Mrs.
Ferrier.
</p>

<p>
<q>Where are you going?</q> he demanded.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am going to the prison to tell
them to let Mr. Schöninger go
free,</q> she answered defiantly. <q>I
am going to take him to my
house.</q>
</p>

<pb n='406'/><anchor id='Pg406'/>

<p>
<q>You are going to do nothing
of the sort,</q> said the priest. <q>You
have no right to, and will only do
harm, and disgrace yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I couldn't be more disgraced
than I am already, with that ...</q>
she began in a loud voice, but F.
Chevreuse stopped her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Silence!</q> he said authoritatively.
<q>You are insane.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>John, drive on!</q> she called out
of the window.
</p>

<p>
<q>John, you will not drive a step
further,</q> said the priest in a low
voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'd better do what he says,
ma'am,</q> said John, leaning down
from the box. <q>And you'd better
not talk so loud. People are beginning
to notice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I should like to know what you
think of yourself for a priest, making
my own servants disobey me,</q>
the poor woman cried, relapsing
into tears. And then, instantly
recovering her spirit, she added,
<q>If I cannot go to the prison, I will
know where my poor daughter is.
I believe Mrs. Gerald could tell.
She must know where they are hid.
I will have Annette back again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You had better come in and
ask Mrs. Gerald,</q> F. Chevreuse
said calmly. <q>Do not hesitate!
It will, perhaps, be better for you
to see her.</q>
</p>

<p>
She shrank a little, yet could not
bear to remain inactive. To her
mind, she had been hushed, and
imposed on, and silenced by everybody,
in order that this worthless
criminal might ruin her daughter's
happiness, and obtain possession
of her money, and she was burning
to pour her anger out on some one.
F. Chevreuse's authoritative interference,
while she yielded to it,
only exasperated her more. <q>I
will go in and find where Annette
is,</q> she said resolutely, and stepped
out of her carriage, too much excited
to stumble.
</p>

<p>
Honora Pembroke came forward
and stood between her and the
door, looking in astonishment at
the two priests who followed her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let her go in!</q> F. O'Donovan
said.
</p>

<p>
She was obliged to, indeed, for
Mrs. Ferrier's strong hand set her
aside as if she had been a feather.
</p>

<p>
The woman entered with a
haughty step and a high head, her
silks rustling about her through the
solemn silence, and walked straight
to the sitting-room. Mrs. Macon
met her at the door, but she put
her aside, and took a step into the
room; only one step, and then she
stopped short, and uttered a cry.
</p>

<p>
<q>See how that mother heard the
news!</q> said F. Chevreuse in a low
voice at her side. <q>Have you any
questions to ask her?</q>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ferrier retreated a step, and
leaned against the door-frame.
They all drew back and left her a
full view of the silent form stretched
on the sofa, and only Honora
Pembroke's weeping disturbed the
silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't say that it killed
her!</q> she exclaimed in a low,
frightened voice; then, before they
could answer, she threw up her
arms, and ran across the room.
<q>You poor dear!</q> she sobbed.
<q>You poor, broken-hearted dear!</q>
</p>

<p>
She flung herself on her knees
beside the sofa, and embraced and
wept over the motionless form
there, all her anger, all thought of
self, forgotten in a generous and
loving pity and grief.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse glanced at his brother
priest with a faint, sad smile.
<q>Her heart is right,</q> he said. <q>It
is always right.</q>
</p>

It was evident that no comb had
touched that wonderful <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>chevelure</foreign>
for several days.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall never be able to comb it
out again,</q> said the Lady from Idaho
in a weak, despairing voice. She
lay on a sofa in a state-room on
board the transatlantic steamer
<hi rend='italic'>Lima</hi>, from New York to Liverpool,
calling at Queenstown. She had
been terribly sea-sick. During seven
days she had not eaten enough to
keep a buffalo-gnat alive.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't mean <q>air,</q> sir,</q> said Edward,
raising his nose to an altitude
of 45°, with the lofty dignity of your
true English waiter. <q>I means
<emph>hair</emph>&mdash;wentilation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! yes. I believe you are
right, Hedward.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Hedward</hi> was a steward on board
the <hi rend='italic'>Lima</hi>, to whose fostering care
the writer was entrusted.
</p>

<p>
The Lady from Idaho had reached
that point of sea-sickness when
one does not want the trouble even
of getting better. We carried her
on deck, however, and laid her,
well wrapped up, on one of the
cushioned seats. The circular
horizon of many days was being
broken by the Irish coast just coming
into view. The mere sight of
land seemed to revive the fair Idaho
traveller. As we neared the coast,
and the green of the fields and trees
could be seen, she said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! what a goodly sight.
What a beautiful country! I could
chant its praises with the most enthusiastic
Irishman of them all!</q>
</p>

<p>
We feasted our eyes on the beautiful
coast until darkness fell upon
it and its outline was marked for
us only by the lights which traced
the curves of the shore.
</p>

<p>
We exchange rocket-signals with
the shore and with other steamers
lying in the bay. The land-breeze
has set the Lady from Idaho on
her feet again. The tug comes
alongside to take the mails and
those passengers who wish to land
at Queenstown. All is bustle and
excitement. There are regretful
leave-takings between fellow-passengers
whom the traditional <q>stand-offishness</q>
of English-speaking people
prevented from enjoying each
other's society until it was almost
time to part. Among those who
go on shore at Queenstown are
the Lady from Idaho&mdash;poor seasick
<pb n='409'/><anchor id='Pg409'/>
soul! she would have gone on
shore days ago, if she could have
found any shore to go on; a young
Irishman bringing his American
bride home for inspection by his
friends in <q>the Black North</q>;
some American ladies and gentlemen
making their first European
tour, evidently determined to be
pleased with everything they see;
some specimens of young and infant
America, and the writer.
</p>

<p>
There's not much provision for
the comfort of passengers on board
the tug. The night is rather moist,
but the cabin is <q>stuffy</q> and ill-ventilated,
and we prefer remaining
on deck.
</p>

<p>
The <q>Cove of Cork</q> is certainly
a beautiful place by day or night.
But the night effect is the finer, <foreign rend='italic'>me
judice</foreign>. The rows of lights rising
above each other, tier on tier, on
the heights, cast a magic glamour
over the scene.
</p>

<p>
The tug has reached her dock.
The custom-house officers have
come on board. Horrid moment!
Worse, however, in anticipation
than in reality, everywhere except
on the trans-Atlantic docks of New
York City.
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you any cigars or tobacco?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Any firearms?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir,</q> I answer, and inwardly
bless my stars that my better and
more sensible half has left behind,
for lack of room, the <q>six-shooter</q>
which I carried for ten years in the
free land of the West. What a
piece of luck! I have been assured
by Irish friends that had I brought
that unhappy <q>six-shooter</q> with
me, I should most undoubtedly
have been arrested for some undefined
bloody intentions with regard
to that most susceptible animal,
the lion of Great Britain. The
lion would have been very much
mistaken; for never were the Irish
shores visited by any one whose
heart was more full of peace and
good-will.
</p>

<p>
Ireland is not a safe place for
any one who has a trans-Atlantic
odor about him during a Fenian
paroxysm. The possession of a
pocket <foreign rend='italic'>derringer</foreign> is sufficient evidence
of belligerent intentions.
New-York-made boots are objects
of suspicion, and in times of excitement
have been the cause of trouble
to the wearer. As harmless and
commercial an article as a wooden
nutmeg, carried merely as a patriotic
souvenir, may entail considerable
annoyance on its possessor,
and perhaps necessitate the good
offices of his consul to enable him
to pursue his tourist path of pleasure
or business in peace. In such
periods as anti-Fenian frenzy, English
ports are the safest and pleasantest;
for in Ireland, then, the
lion is rampant, roaring and seeking
whom he may devour. It is
better to keep away from his super-serviceable
retainers in Ireland.
</p>

<p>
But the political horizon is unclouded.
The bloody-minded revolutionists
of the pen and inkstand are
quiescent for the nonce. We find
the officials kind and polite. They
opened only one of our trunks.
They gave its contents merely a
cursory inspection, and chalked cabalistic
characters on all our boxes,
portmanteaus, satchels, etc. They
fished for no fee, nor was any offered
them.
</p>

<p>
It is nearly midnight when we
leave the tug. We step ashore.
After a quarter of a century of absence,
my foot is upon my native
heath. My name is not MacGregor,
dear reader, nor is it Micawber.
</p>

<p>
I do not think people feel much
at the moment that anything happens
<pb n='410'/><anchor id='Pg410'/>
to them. It is either before
or after; in anticipation or retrospection.
In describing their sensations,
they tell us what they suppose
they are going to feel, or
what they think they ought to have
felt. I have stood bare-headed by
the grave of Washington at Mount
Vernon. I believe the man and
his work to be among the greatest
that ever blest the world. What
did I feel? A kind of sorrowful,
reverential, awe-struck mental
numbness; then a sad yet selfish
pity for my kind, who, however
good and great they be, e'en
to this favor must they come at
last. I could not have distinctly
shaped a thought or given expression
to any of the ideas which a
visit to the grave of Washington
might be supposed to suggest to a
conventionally susceptible imagination.
Yet my eyes were full of
tears. In the evening, however,
in a comfortable room at Willard's,
in an easy-chair by a cheerful
fire, in the pleasant ease of slippers
and cigars, with a quire of thick,
white, unglazed letter-paper before
me, any kind of steel pen (I
hate a gold pen for literary work;
it has a counting-house suggestiveness
that seems to disagree with the
muses), with mayhap a modicum
of <foreign rend='italic'>vin chaud</foreign> at my elbow, what
pages of <q>Thoughts suggested by a
visit to the grave of Washington</q>
I could have <q>knocked off</q>! But
unluckily Jones rushed in with the
sad news that poor Thompson had
been killed on the other side of the
river, and drove all the intended
<q>Thoughts</q> out of my head.
There is no real present. We have
only the past and the future.
</p>

<p>
The debarkation of a number of
ladies, children, trunks, boxes, and
carpet-bags is not generative of the
softer emotions. The night is damp
and chilly. It has reached the wee
sma' hours. There is no omnibus
or hack to take us to the hotel.
Some night-birds, with low, flat caps
and Corkonian accents, offer to carry
our luggage and show us the way to
the hotel. It is <q>only a step or two.</q>
The cortége sets out for the hotel.
Corkonian youngsters&mdash;who ought
to have been in their beds, if they
had any beds to go to&mdash;come suddenly
out of the darkness, and ask,
with wonderful chromatic elocution,
the privilege of carrying our
satchels. It is useless to tell them
we do not need their assistance.
They will not be denied. They
keep up their chromatics until we
succumb. Well, it is sixpence
each for them&mdash;a treble, or American,
gratuity. An American, native
or adopted, to whom, especially if
he have lived in the West, <q>a quarter</q>
seems the lowest gratuity that
he can offer to the negro who blacks
his boots in a sleeping-car, feels an
impulse of lavishness on touching
Irish ground. He <q>feels good,</q>
and wishes to make all around him
partake of the feeling. Half a dollar
seems the least that he can offer
the waiter at the hotel with justice
to his own dignity and that of the
country he has the honor to represent.
He is not always so generous
when he returns at the end of his
tour, and the gratuity system of
Britain has disgusted him and helped
to deplete his purse. Then he
comes down to the smallest silver
coin in his <foreign rend='italic'>portemonnaie</foreign>. He
cannot offer coppers, and never
gets as low as the Englishman's
<q>tuppence.</q>
</p>

<p>
The English and the Irish in
Ireland inveigh bitterly against the
American propensity to give extravagant
<foreign rend='italic'>douceurs</foreign>. They say that
Americans are spoiling their waiters,
porters, servants, etc. They
<pb n='411'/><anchor id='Pg411'/>
call this liberality snobbishness, desire
to display! The fact is, it is
partly a matter of habit, partly a
want of knowledge of the comparative
values of <q>tips</q> at home and
abroad. What American from the
further side of the Mississippi expects
to get anything for a penny?
Add to this, what I before remarked,
that the American in Ireland <q>feels
good,</q> and wants to scatter around
all the good he can.
</p>

<p>
Well! here we are at the hotel.
A somewhat stupefied porter receives
us. He has to see somebody
before he can inform us as to the
probability of entertainment. He
has not indicated any room where
the ladies and children can sit and
take the night-chill off while we
await the result of his conference
with Mr. or Mrs. Boniface. We
remain standing in the entry, our
carpet-bags and wraps in our
hands. At length the comatose
porter returns, and says that bed-rooms
are ready for us!
</p>

<p>
<q>Can we have any supper?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir. The cook's gone home,
sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not a cup of tea?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir. It's too late, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At least, we can have some hot
Irish whiskey-punch?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir. There's no hot wather
in the house, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is there any <emph>cold</emph> water in the
house?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of coorse there is, sir,</q> replies
our negative Amphitryon, slightly
roused by the question.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then bring me some Irish
whiskey and <emph>cold</emph> water.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir, I'll thry, sir. I'll see
if the bar-maid isn't asleep, sir, and
get the key from her, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
We were then presented with
one-third of a tallow candle each,
and marshalled to our respective
sleeping-apartments. No chance
of a little pleasant chatter and
some gentle exhilaration on our
first night on Irish soil.
</p>

<p>
We sleep pretty well, however,
and pretty long into the forenoon
of the next day. Waiter comes to
say that we can have breakfast in
the coffee-room whenever we desire
it. This is a delicate hint that we
are not early risers. He wants to
know when we wish breakfast and
of what we wish it composed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Chops and tomato-sauce, ham
and eggs&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, sir. <emph>Rashers</emph> and eggs, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Beefsteak, tea, and coffee, in
half an hour.</q>
</p>

<p>
Raining! The view of the bay
is rather cheerless. Everything
looks dankish, dingy, and dull.
</p>

<p>
<q>Can you realize that you are in I
Ireland?</q> I inquire of the Lady
from Idaho.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not in the least,</q> responds the
most amiable of her sex. <q>Can
you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, indeed.</q>
</p>

<p>
It is not a good morning for the
interchange of ideas. Misty mornings
never are. As for certain projected
<q>Thoughts on touching Irish
soil after twenty-five years' absence,</q>
their suggesting themselves
under such a murky sky is out of
the question. They will have to
wait for the bright, creative sun.
Perhaps, after a good warm breakfast,
one may be able to think some
<q>Thoughts,</q> if the railway time-tables
will admit of it.
</p>

<p>
The <q>coffee-room</q> of <q>the best
hotel</q> is cold and cheerless.
Smoke without fire is obtained from
some wet coal-dust, economically
caked, according to the mode of
thrifty housekeepers in the British
Isles, in an infinitesimal grate in a
remote corner of the room. Impossible
to think any <q>Thoughts</q>
here. Some solemn-looking men,
<pb n='412'/><anchor id='Pg412'/>
very particular about their chops&mdash;I
mean their mutton-chops&mdash;are enjoying&mdash;or,
more correctly, consuming,
for there is no evidence of enjoyment&mdash;their
morning meal.
</p>

<p>
Our breakfast is not a bad one.
The chops are excellent; the beefsteak,
so-so. I have eaten better
beef in New York. The bread is
hard and heavy, but white and not
ill-tasted. I wish the Irish and
English waiters would adopt the
short alpaca jacket and long white
apron of the waiters of Paris and
New York. It is a much neater
and cleaner costume. The greasy
full-dress coat and limp, whity-brown
neck-cloth are not only absurd;
they are often disgusting.
</p>

<p>
Still raining! The sidewalks
are hid from view by the thickly-passing
umbrellas. Let us go and
buy some umbrellas! Life seems
to be impossible without them here.
In the three kingdoms, umbrellas
are indispensable to respectability.
</p>

<p>
<q>I hate respectability,</q> said the
Lady from Idaho with a vicious
emphasis.
</p>

<p>
I was rather astonished by this
outburst, but I reflected that allowance
must be made for ladies'
tempers on draggle-tail mornings.
</p>

<p>
<q>Such weather,</q> I remarked, <q>is
enough to make one hate anything.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is not that,</q> she retorted.
<q>I hate respectability, rain or shine.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Des goûts et des couleurs</foreign>&mdash;you
know the old proverb.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is nothing more selfish,
more hypocritical, more cowardly,
than <q>respectability.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear madam, I did not
take the trouble of coming from
the other side of the Rocky Mountains
for the purpose of chopping
logic. I must buy umbrellas.</q>
</p>

<p>
I bought me an umbrella.
Thenceforward I was only separated
from it during sleep and meals
while I remained in the British
Islands. It was almost always
necessary. The wretch who sold
it to me, however, saw that I wore
overshoes, and charged me about
three Irish prices. I feel certain
that the day will come when he
will be fitly punished. He will
emigrate to the United States
sooner or later, and the hackmen
or <foreign rend='italic'>restaurateurs</foreign> of New York will
avenge me!
</p>

<p>
Steam is a wonderful leveller.
It is destroying national costume
and toning down national peculiarities.
The same round hat which
was worn in New York when I left
is worn in Queenstown; the same
fashion of winter overcoat. The
up-and-down-the-gamut intonations
of the Cork brogue, however,
bring you to a consciousness of
your true latitude and longitude.
The long, hooded cloth cloaks of
the peasant women have some suggestions
of nationality about them.
Occasionally, too, a girl of seventeen
or eighteen with bare feet and
short kirtle is seen. This is characteristic.
</p>

<p>
<q>Buy a bunch of Irish shamrocks
from me, sir? Now, do, sir, if ye
plase.</q>
</p>

<p>
We cannot refuse. We lay in a
plentiful supply of the chosen leaf
of bard and chief.
</p>

<p>
<q>Long life to you, sir, and to
the purty ladies and the beautiful
childer, and all the blessings in the
world on ye. May ye never know
what it is to want anything for
them!</q>
</p>

<p>
The shamrocks alone were not
dear; but with such a prayer added,
we felt as if we were taking the
poor woman's stock in trade for
nothing.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of course, I expected
to find Ireland rather backward
<pb n='413'/><anchor id='Pg413'/>
as regards women's rights
and that sort of thing. I was
somewhat surprised, therefore, on
entering the telegraph office, to find
a telegraphist of the gentler sex.
She seemed to be quite a business
young lady&mdash;quick, intelligent, and
polite. With the least possible
display of conscious superiority,
she instructed me in the mode of
filling those absurd British blanks
for my first British telegrams.
With the condescending gentleness
of an amiable <q>school-marm</q>
instructing a good boy of unfortunately
limited knowledge and capacity,
she <q>posted</q> me in the
names and location of streets in
Dublin. She was industrious as
well as intelligent. She had
brought her knitting. During our
conversation, she doubly improved
the shining hour by rolling into a
ball a skein of worsted which a
most serious and attentive young
lady of eight or nine summers held
distended on her outstretched and
uplifted hands.
</p>

<p>
The hotel at which we stopped
was managed by women. I afterwards
remarked, in my trip through
the island, that the internal economy
of most of the hotels in Ireland is
under female direction. The post-offices
and postal-telegraph offices
are very generally managed by
women. There are numerous
institutions for the care of aged,
sick, or destitute women, or for the
rescue and reformation of the poor
erring sisters who have been led
away from the paths of purity and
peace.
</p>

<p>
<q>I really believe, after all,</q> said
the Lady from Idaho to me one day,
in conversation on this subject,
<q>that they take better care of their
women than we do.</q>
</p>

<p>
We take the cars for Cork. We
ride to the <q>beautiful city</q> through
the loveliest bit of landscape on
which the sun ever shone, or, more
appositely, on which the gentle rain
from heaven ever fell. It is indeed
a land of loveliness and song. The
good-natured guard, having remarked
our overshoes doubtless, puts
his face to the car-window, and enthusiastically
asks:
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, sir, an' isn't this a
counthry worth fightin' for?</q>
</p>

<p>
Confound the fellow! even
though he be bright-faced and
seems good-natured. I wish those
people who are eternally talking
about fighting and never doing it&mdash;except
among themselves&mdash;would
stop talking, or, if they cannot do
anything better, go out, take a good
<q>licking</q> manfully, and be done
with it. Daring and doing, even
if one gets the worst of it, is better
than loud talking and nothing doing.
I hate the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>vox et præterea
nihil</foreign>. We have had too much
of it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Faith,</q> says the guard, <q>it's the
fine, healthy-looking childer ye've
got. Shure, they don't look like
Yankee childer at all, at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If by Yankee you mean <emph>American</emph>,
my friend, that they undoubtedly
are,</q> replies the gentleman
responsible for the little responsibilities
who are too healthy-looking
to be like <q>Yankee childer</q>;
<q>but they come from ayont the Mississippi,
which may account in some
degree for their hardy appearance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What town is that on the other
side of the water?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Passage, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
Passage! Shade of <q>Father

our tongues in luscious enjoyment
around thy roaring lyric in praise

</p>

<p>
Not in this wide world is there a
lovelier piece of landscape than
that between Queenstown and
Cork. Here the Lee is bordered
by lovely lawns of the freshest
green, sloping gently to the water's
edge. Further on it flows between
verdurous walls of lofty trees. The
leaves of their drooping branches
kiss the rippling current as it passes.
Yonder the Castle of Blackrock
frowns over its gently-flowing
tide. The grass and the leaves
are green with a vivid greenness
that justifies all that the poets have
sung about the Emerald Island.
What glory in thy long, green vistas,
beautiful Glanmire!
</p>

<p>
Our road is bordered on one
side by the river; on the other,
rich demesnes, bounded by trees,
ivy-covered walls, and moss-covered
rocks, from which fall miniature
cascades and waves the green
and graceful fern.
</p>

<p>
The landscape needs only one
modest charm to make its loveliness
complete. I miss the humble
cottage, lowly yet lovely, where
honest labor finds its comfort and
repose. There are rich mansions
and umbrageous groves and broad
pastures, but no smoke ascends
from cheerful hearths of tillers of
the soil. The peasantry, whose
cottages might grace these lovely
glades, are building themselves new
homes on the broad prairies of the
West. The humble wooden sheds
or the rough cabins on the brown
and treeless plains, sacred to the
Lares of independence and self-reliance,
are far lovelier in the
eyes of the lover of his kind than
thy greenest glades, beautiful Glanmire!

does not do itself justice to-day.
The rain, which softens and freshens
the beauties of the country,
blackens and bedraggles the town.
<q>God made the country, and man
made the town.</q>
</p>

<p>
But what are those deep, soft
tones that reach us through the
humid air? Can it be? Yes, there
is no doubt about it. We are listening
to

Cork, with its fine bridges crossing
the branches of the Lee, might,
under bright atmospheric effects, lay
claim to its antique designation; but,
amid mud and rain, the most enthusiastic
traveller can see no extraordinary
beauty even in Paris
itself. Church spires and buildings
darkened by the rain have a
gloomy look. Even the church of
S. Anne, which may fairly be said
to have <q>two sides to it</q>&mdash;one being
of differently-colored stone from
the other&mdash;has had its peculiar
claims to the traveller's attention
somewhat weakened by the effect
of the rain.

We have concluded to wend our
way quietly toward Dublin, taking
in our route anything that may be
of interest. The Great Southern
and Western Railway runs through
one of the most beautiful districts
in Ireland. A long panorama of
beautiful and characteristic scenes
is unrolled as you steam along.
Green hedges and slopes, furze-covered
fences, century-old trees
covered with moss and ivy, rippling
streams, a ruined abbey or dismantled
tower, bits of soft blue appearing
through slate-colored clouds&mdash;the
humid atmosphere toning down
all harsh lines, and yet spreading a
sweet though melancholy softness
over all&mdash;this limited by the gentle
undulations of the ground, whose
beautiful curves give life to the
landscape, yet circumscribe its horizon,
and you have the peculiar
characteristics of an Irish landscape.
</p>

<p>
There is an air of solidity about
the track and its accessories to
an eye habituated to trans-Mississippi
railroads. Very pretty are
those stations of stone, covered
with green ivy, every foot of space
in front of them devoted to the
culture of some sweet, simple
flowers. The Lady from Idaho,
who has recently been dipping her
gentle nose into the cryptogamia,
is in ecstasies over the magnificent
ferns we have passed at various
points of our route.
</p>

<p>
For an excellent railway dinner,
let me recommend Limerick station
to the traveller. The best
railway breakfast I have ever eaten&mdash;and
I have eaten not a few in
both hemispheres&mdash;I ate at Altoona,
on the Pennsylvania Central.
It was twelve years ago, however.
The best railway dinner I have
ever eaten I had at Limerick
Junction. It would have done credit
to many a pretentious hotel on
either continent. It surpassed the
<foreign rend='italic'>menu</foreign> of private hotels in London,
<q>patronized by officers of both
services and their families.</q> It
was a better meal than I have had
at what is considered one of the
best hotels in Northern Germany,
and did not cost half so much. It
was well and comfortably served,
<foreign rend='italic'>malgré</foreign> the ponderous solemnity of
the British style of hotel attendance,
which to me is a terrible bore.
Plenty of time was allowed us to
eat and enjoy our meal. Some
jovial young gentlemen at the table
politely caused champagne to
be offered us, in compliment to our
trans-Atlantic character. They insisted,
as far as politeness would
admit, on regaling us; but we declined
indulgence in the lively
beverage. Sparkling wines are
not good to travel on. One of the
gentlemen was fascinated by a
<pb n='416'/><anchor id='Pg416'/>
specimen of infantine America&mdash;a
member of our party, and one of
its most important members, by
the way. The champagne, probably,
had a softening effect on the
gentleman. He lamented his childless
condition, and expressed his
readiness to give fabulous amounts
for the little Columbian stranger.
The father of the latter good-humoredly
told the gentleman that
Young America, white or black,
is out of the market, and has been
so for some years.
</p>

<p>
The bell rings. We resume our
seats in the train. We have a carriage
to ourselves. The guard
told us, on leaving Cork, that he
would try to keep us alone. This
means that he wants a gratuity at
the journey's end; for your conductor,
or <q>guard,</q> on European
railways is not above taking a
shilling or a sixpence. He shall
have it, so far as we are concerned.
</p>

<p>
The manner of starting a train
is good. The bell rings&mdash;signal to
the passengers to take their seats.
There are two guards, one in front
and one in rear, each supplied
with a whistle. They look along
the train to see that the doors of
all the compartments are closed.
The forward guard, seeing all right
at his end, blows his whistle. The
rear guard, to make assurance
doubly sure, glances along the
entire train, and, finding everything
in readiness, whistles. The second
whistle is the signal to the engineer,
who then sounds the steam-whistle,
and the train starts.
</p>

<p>
The trains generally exceed ours
in rapidity, but are very much behind
them in comfort and elegance.
There is no drinking-water
in the English or Irish carriages.
There are no stoves to keep one warm
in cold weather or during the chilly
hours of the night. If the weather
is cold, tin foot-warmers, filled with
water which is not always warm, are
furnished in the proportion of one
to two first-class passengers. There
is no luxurious sleeping-car, where
you can sleep comfortably, awake
refreshed, find your boots ready
blacked when you get up, and wash
yourself at a marble wash-stand.
No comfortable hotel-car, into
which you can step from the sleeping-car
in your slippers, and enjoy
your beef-steak and fried potatoes,
or your quail on toast, at the rate
of thirty miles an hour.
</p>

<p>
In consequence of the absence of
arrangements for personal comfort
on trains, the British traveller is
obliged to weight himself down and
half fill his compartment with rolls
of railway rugs, bottles of water,
and plethoric lunch-baskets, to his
own great inconvenience, as well as
that of his fellow-travellers. The
trouble caused by the want of a
proper system of baggage transportation
compels the traveller to
carry huge leather portmanteaus
about five times as large as an ordinary
American travelling-satchel.
As these are considered <q>parcels
that can be carried in the hand,</q>
the traveller is allowed to take them
into the carriage with him. By
this means he avoids the trouble of
watching the <q>luggage-van</q> at junctions,
and the delay of waiting for
its unloading at the terminus.
Then come bundles of umbrellas
and canes strapped together, and
the leather hat-box&mdash;that inseparable
adjunct of British respectability.
Behold the unprotected matron,
surrounded by half a dozen
family jewels, with any quantity of
wraps and lunch-baskets, and bottles
and umbrellas, and band-boxes
and multitudinous matters wrapped
up in endless newspaper packages!
How she glares at you
<pb n='417'/><anchor id='Pg417'/>
when you step as carefully as you
can among the formidable piles to
three square inches of a seat in the
interior corner! Woe be to him
who displaces one of the parcels
sacred to family use. I might be
able to stand a Gorgon, but I could
not stand that. Please do not put
me in the carriage with the matron!
Rather in the van with the
untamable hyena, Mr. Guard, if you
please!
</p>

<p>
Imagine a succession of Broadway
omnibuses, with windows and
doors at either end, placed laterally
behind an engine, and you have an
European railway train. Half the
passengers necessarily sit with their
backs to the engine. The first-class
carriages are upholstered in
cloth or plush like hackney coaches.
The benches are divided into two
double seats on each side, giving
seats for eight passengers in each
compartment. The compartment
is lighted by a small and generally
dim and smoky oil-lamp placed in
the roof.
</p>

<p>
In the second-class carriages the
seats are not divided. Six persons
are supposed to be accommodated
on each bench. On some lines the
seats are very thinly cushioned with
leather; generally, they are not
cushioned. In France and Belgium
the second-class carriages are cushioned
and backed with gray cloth,
and the difference in comfort between
them and the first-class carriages
is not worth the difference
of fare. This is about one-third
greater for first-class tickets.
Twelve persons, with a proportionate
quantity of wraps, bundles, baskets,
bottles, umbrellas, and portmanteaus,
pack a compartment
pretty closely. Your European
traveller makes as much preparation
for a trip of sixty miles as an
American would for an all-rail
journey from New York to San
Francisco. An American railroad
car is quite a cheerful <q>institution</q>;
whereas travelling seems to be a
more serious business on the other
side of the Atlantic. A compartment&mdash;first
or second class&mdash;is a
gloomy place. In first-class carriages,
the <q>swells</q> and snobs are
afraid to imperil their dignity by
risking intercourse with somebody
who may be <q>nobody.</q> The result
is silence and solemnity. In
second-class carriages you often
find very pleasant people&mdash;clergymen,
professional men, young tourists,
artists, and students&mdash;who can
talk pleasantly and well, and have
no snobbish, conventional dread of
doing so.
</p>

<p>
It is a common saying in England
that only fools and Americans
travel first-class. I have heard of
a crusty old Irish peer, who, being
asked why he always travels third-class,
replied that he does so because
<q>there is no fourth class.</q>
I think the venerable lord was
rather ostentatious of his humility.
I would not advise any of my
American friends to try third-class
travelling in England or Ireland.
A third-class car is a cold, dirty,
noisome place. It is full of tobacco-smoke
and the smell of strong
drinks of various kinds. It is worse
than the forward car on a prairie
railroad, filled with immigrants and
<q>railroad hands.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mail trains are generally composed
of first and second class carriages
only. Class distinctions meet us
everywhere. We find a first and second
class waiting-room, first and
second class restaurant, third-class
waiting-room and third-class restaurant.
The waiting-rooms are separate
for each sex in each class. You
are parted from your wife, sister, or
sweetheart. If you have something
<pb n='418'/><anchor id='Pg418'/>
of importance to communicate
to your fair companion, and should
appear near the door of the ladies'
waiting-room for that purpose, a
pre-Raphaelite female, armed with
a broom, throws herself into the
breach, and fiercely demands your
business, while she reduces you
almost to a jelly by a Gorgon
glare.

<p>
By The Comte Achille De Jouffroy
</p>

<p>
From Paris Ou Le Livre Des Cent-Et-Un.
</p>

<p>
Several friends of the exiled
royal family, having been led by
devotion to their cause to visit
Scotland, have published detailed
accounts of the residence at Holyrood.
These narratives have left
but little untold concerning the
august proscribed personages, their
situation, their mode of life, and their
habits, the uniformity of which no
important circumstance occurred
to modify during the two years of
their abode in the ancient palace
of the Stuarts.
</p>

<p>
The reader, therefore, must not
expect to meet in the following
sketch with descriptions which
have already been given by others
with much minuteness, and which
have been repeated in various
works. Here will be found merely
a small number of observations,
impartially collected, which may
serve to combat prejudices of a diverse
nature that have been called
forth, as well by the assertions of
an unjust and bitter hatred, as by
the injudicious efforts of a flattering
servility.
</p>

<p>
Certainly, any enemy of the royal
family, unless he were insane or
wicked, had he been admitted into
the privacy of Holyrood, must at
least have ceased to regard them
with dislike. Their most prejudiced
adversary, no matter to what
distinguished rank of society he
might belong, could not have
learned to know the domestic virtues
displayed by these princes in
adversity without wishing himself
to have a father, a son, a wife, a
sister, or children resembling them.
On the other hand, those who,
through attachment, duty, or interest
(for there are political situations
which a well-comprehended interest
forces some to retain, even after
the occurrence of disasters)&mdash;those,
I say, who have made themselves
the noisy apologists of this family
have carried exaggeration so far as
to attribute to them qualities and
talents which would have been
more than sufficient for ruling even
in these difficult times; without reflecting
that this blindness of zeal
in regard to princes who met with
so sudden a downfall while surrounded
by a faithful army, and in
the midst of devoted provinces,
must diminish the confidence due
to that portion of the eulogium
which is really just. As private
individuals, the Bourbons of the
elder branch have never merited
the smallest of the outrages which
it has been their fate to endure; as
sovereigns, it is well known they
have been great chiefly in their fall,
and have shown their courage and
resolution less in their lives than in
their deaths.
</p>

<p>
The writers of whom I speak, carried
away by the feelings of their
hearts, have poured them forth in
eloquent descriptions. Identifying
themselves, so to speak, with the
<pb n='420'/><anchor id='Pg420'/>
misfortunes of which they have
been witnesses, they have given us
chiefly the recital of their own
emotions. I shall not imitate
them; the spectacle of an entire
family, precipitated from the most
brilliant of thrones into the miseries
of exile, is of itself sufficiently
touching; it has in it enough of sad
sublimity to render it useless to
overload the picture with the pretentious
ornaments of the elegiac
style. To put together sentimental
phrases for the purpose of describing
a misfortune like this is to
place one's self, no matter what talents
one may possess or exhibit,
very much beneath the level of the
subject.
</p>

<p>
I have considered this preamble
needful in order to avoid being taxed
with coldness. To speak with
a suitable calmness of the Bourbons
may perhaps be permitted to
one who for fifteen years has defended
their cause, and who has
followed them into banishment;
who has never obtained from them
either favors or places, and who
also has never betrayed them.
</p>

<p>
In quitting France, Charles X.
had only carried away with him,
after so much splendor, a sum barely
sufficient for a modest subsistence
during a few years. The
abode at Lullworth was expensive;
its vicinity to France made it accessible
to a crowd of travellers,
many of whom came only to solicit
from the king, in return for services
past, or in view of services offered,
the assistance which the unfortunate
monarch was no longer in a condition
to grant without reducing
himself to want. In order to escape
from these importunities, and to
withdraw himself from the painful
necessity of refusing, he asked and
obtained from the British government
the enjoyment of the asylum
which he had already for a long
time inhabited during the period
of his first exile.
</p>

<p>
The capital of Scotland, in which
is situated the palace of Holyrood,
is in the same latitude as Moscow,
but its vicinity to the sea renders
its temperature much more endurable.
Edinburgh is, in many respects,
the most agreeable residence
which a stranger can select in
Great Britain. The liberal arts are
there cultivated with a particular
devotion. It is a large town, picturesque
in the extreme, and sumptuously
built. The seat of old
Edinburgh is worthy of remark; in
seeking for a comparison which
may convey an idea of it, the device
of the arms of the kingdom
naturally occurs to furnish me with
one. Imagine, at the entrance of a
deep and narrow valley formed by
the hills of Salisbury and Calton,
an enormous lion, half couched.
His head, which is turned towards
the rising sun, and overlooks the
plain, is a peaked rock, three hundred
feet in elevation, and nobly
crowned by the old castle. To
the right and left, the houses are
suspended from his flanks, like the
waves of his mane. The ridge of
his spine is represented by a long
street, which, dividing the two opposite
declivities, begins from the
esplanade of the castle, and terminates
at the Canongate in front of
the portal of Holyrood. The new
town occupies the plateau of Calton
hill. Larger than the old town,
it is also better built, and all the
streets are laid out in regular
squares.
</p>

<p>
This city, take it altogether, resembles
none other with which we
are acquainted. It is an assemblage
of monuments of every age
and in every style, built of beautiful
stone, many of them very carefully
<pb n='421'/><anchor id='Pg421'/>
constructed, and thrown, in
the most picturesque manner, upon
projections of rugged rocks, in the
hollows of precipices, on the slopes
of valleys. Magnificent bridges, gigantic
causeways, unite the different
parts of the city. The ancient
and the modern are preserved without
alteration of character. Here
rise houses of eleven stories, the
highest of which is on a level with
the great street of which we have
spoken. There, beside a Greek
peristyle, the luxury of the boudoir
is sheltered by embattled towers.
At the sight of this singular town,
of this variety of edifices, of these
steep mountains, of the sea, and of
the sky, we can more fully comprehend
the genius of Sir Walter Scott.
Everything here seems created to
clothe with form and substance the
conceptions of romance. Here we
can walk, if we like, under Athenian
porticos or in Gothic cloisters, and
can pass from the sombre tints of
a feudal habitation to drawing-rooms
freshly decorated in the modern
style of luxury; we can leave
the modest sidewalks of the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>bourgeois</foreign>
of the XVth century, above
which the projecting roofs and gables
are still in good preservation,
to enter upon railways, those marvels
of modern invention. At
every step our eyes are met by objects
less precious, perhaps, from
the value they represent than from
the associations they recall: the
crown of gold enriched with jewels,
the sceptre, and the sword of the
ancient kings of Scotland, discovered,
fifteen years ago, in a walled-up
room of the old castle; the furniture
used by Mary Stuart; the
embroidery which occupied the
last happy leisure hours of this unfortunate
queen; the tapestry raised
by the assassins of Rizzio when
they entered her apartment; the
bed of crimson damask on which
she used to sleep. Here we tread
on the ashes of a long line of kings,
of a multitude of celebrated personages;
and the last circumstance
worthy of note, in this abode so
suggestive of mysterious traditions
and royal misfortunes, is that the
wreck of the court of the Tuileries
have taken refuge beneath the ancient
hereditary roof of James II.
</p>

<p>
The palace of Holyrood is nothing
but a cold and gloomy cloister,
flanked at the two extremities of
its anterior front by towers. The
apartments of Charles X., situated
on the first floor, extend over one of
the sides of the cloister, and over
the angle opposite the principal entrance.
After crossing a vestibule
leading to the chapel, an ante-chamber,
an unfurnished gallery, a billiard-room,
we enter the dining-room&mdash;a
gloomy apartment with
bare walls, containing only an oval
table and chairs. From thence we
pass into a drawing-room twenty-five
feet square, opening upon a
small, uncultivated enclosure called
a garden, and furnished in the style
of the drawing-room of a Parisian
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>bourgeois</foreign>. It was in this apartment
that receptions for strangers were
held from eleven to twelve o'clock
in the morning; and in the evening,
all the royal family met here after
dinner. The persons belonging to
the household and the invited
guests were admitted to these <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>soirées</foreign>,
which lasted until about ten
o'clock. The Duc de Bordeaux<note place='foot'>Afterwards Comte de Chambord.</note>
and mademoiselle played games together;
the king had a whist-table;
the dauphiness and her ladies worked
at a round table. Frequently the
conversation became general, and
was almost always interesting. The
French and English newspapers
<pb n='422'/><anchor id='Pg422'/>
were read and commented upon.
Sometimes the king and the dauphin
would repair to the billiard-room,
and play a few games together.
In these <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>soirées</foreign>, there was no
more etiquette observed than is
usual in the house of a gentleman
living on his estates.
</p>

<p>
At the left of the drawing-room,
a door led to an intermediate
apartment, forming the private
study of the king. Into this opened
his bed-chamber. With the
sleeping-room of the king communicated
that of the Duc de Bordeaux,
situated on the same floor, and
looking into the courtyard. The
Baron de Saint Aubin occupied a
room at the side; the apartments of
mademoiselle were on the upper
floor.
</p>

<p>
The Duc de Blacas, when he was
at Holyrood, had the superintendence
of the household; when he
was absent, the details of these
functions were directed by the
Baron de Saint Aubin. The suite
was composed of about forty persons,
lodged in the town in the
vicinity of the palace.
</p>

<p>
The equipages of the king were
limited to one carriage, hired by the
month. When this was not sufficient,
another coach was sent for;
and three saddle-horses sufficed for
the rides of the king and his family.
Charles X., having given up the
amusement of hunting, and needing
exercise to maintain his health, was
in the habit of walking every day
three or four miles around Holyrood.
The table was supplied
abundantly, but without luxury;
the king usually invited two or
three strangers, but the number of
covers seldom exceeded fourteen or
fifteen.
</p>

<p>
Such was the mediocrity to which
fate had reduced this family, so
lately surrounded by the greatest
possible luxury and splendor. No
sign of regret, no trace of vexation,
could be perceived on the countenance
of Charles X. Never did a
word of bitterness escape from the
lips of these illustrious sufferers.
The dauphiness, whom some have
dared to represent as a vindictive
and fanatical woman, was gentleness
itself. In vain would any one
have sought, in the expression of
her face, so full of goodness and
resignation, for even the appearance
of a pride which nevertheless
her elevated rank would have sufficiently
justified. As to the dauphin,
so far did he carry his abnegation
of all personal resentment
that he was more than once heard
to recall with commendation the
talents and bravery of some officers
whom he had overwhelmed with
his favors, but who, nevertheless,
had been the first to betray him.
</p>

<p>
Every one admitted to Holyrood
could not but recognize and admire
the presence of those virtues
which form the charm of domestic
life. They doubtless do not suffice
for those upon whom Heaven has
imposed the terrible task of governing
men. The most marked trait
in the character of Charles X. is
indecision; in that of the dauphin,
a pretension to acuteness, which
has more than once discouraged
his friends, without inspiring confidence
in his enemies. As for the
dauphiness, the intensity of her
misfortunes in this world has led
her to fix her hopes upon a better
one. Pious, although tolerant, she
herself feels that her counsels
would be of little avail in this age
of incredulity. In what she desires
for France, she never can separate
religion from legitimacy. When,
at Holyrood, she heard of the pillage
of the archbishopric, these
words fell from her lips: <q>Alas! the
<pb n='423'/><anchor id='Pg423'/>
French have cast off religion, and
at length I begin to comprehend
why it is they hate us.</q>
</p>

<p>
The Duchesse de Berri was a
being apart in the royal family.
Young, animated, full of regrets, of
desires, and of hopes, she could not
pardon those who had prevented her
from presenting herself before the
Parisians on the 30th of July, 1830, in
order to claim from them the crown
for her son. Confident in her adventurous
courage and in her ability to
create for herself another future, her
irritation for the past and the projects
she still contemplated, little
agreed either with the calm resignation
of the dauphiness or with the
habitual prudence of the king. She
could only endure for a few weeks
the monotony of the residence at
Holyrood. Besides, the rigor of the
climate appeared to affect her health,
and she repaired to the mineral
waters of Bath. Here various
speculators came to surround her,
in a manner to take possession of
her as of a pledge for their future
fortunes, and induced her to borrow
considerable sums of money on the
property still remaining to her, in order
to defray the expenses of the
projected expedition. The duchess
was brought to London, where the
final arrangements for this loan
were to be made. She was concealed
in a small house, and not a single
Frenchman, excepting those composing
the circle by whom she was
surrounded, knew what had become
of her until the day of the embarkation.
</p>

<p>
The announcement of the departure
of the duchess was received
at Holyrood with a species of consternation.
The expedition she
was about to undertake was regarded
as an act of extreme imprudence.
To throw herself into
France, in order to create an insurrection,
without arms, without money,
without the prospect of assistance
from any European power; to
give herself up to the chances of
inconsiderate promises made by a
few men without influence and
without resources; to calculate
chiefly upon the defection of an
army, recomposed in part, and still
agitated by the preceding defection
into which the sudden departure
of the king had precipitated it&mdash;this
was, in the eyes of the exiles of
Holyrood, to attempt an enterprise
of which the success would scarcely
have justified the temerity, and of
which the success itself was considered
impossible. Other reasons for
fear, which we may now be permitted
to recall, disturbed the heart of
the old monarch. He distrusted
the impetuosity of the duchess, her
fiery temperament, her ardent and
independent character, which, even
should it not lead her to disregard
conventionalities, might authorize
those possessing her confidence
and affection to overstep their limits
in her affairs. He foresaw more
than one disaster; he dreaded all
sorts of misfortunes. The unfortunate
princess was destined to experience
them all. The Duc de
Blacas was commissioned to follow
her, and to oppose, as far as it
might be in his power, the dangerous
influence of her advisers; but
the resolution of the duchess was
too much in unison with her tastes
and character. Soon the position
of M. de Blacas towards her became
no longer tenable, and he returned
without having accomplished
anything, to the great displeasure
of the king.
</p>

<p>
Charles X. never approved of
the projects for civil war. When
these were proposed to him, he did
not manifest that aversion which
has been attributed to him by his
<pb n='424'/><anchor id='Pg424'/>
flatterers; he simply replied that, in
the times in which we live, civil
war is a thing difficult to undertake
and impossible to sustain. He had
been a king; he was acquainted
with the secrets of the government;
he knew that all the forces of the
kingdom being at the present day
centralized, the provinces cannot
withdraw themselves from the power
of the telegraph and of the budget;
and that nothing but a signal
disaffection on the part of the army
would be likely to produce a second
20th of March. The riots
which took place in the capital at
first excited his attention; but after
the days of the 5th and 6th of
June, he appeared to have ceased
to fear, or rather to hope, for their
success.
</p>

<p>
As for foreign war, Charles X.
never could endure the idea of it.
Never did it enter his thoughts to
implore the armed intervention of
other sovereigns. He believed that
a third invasion of France, were it
to take place, would lead to incalculable
disasters; to the partition
of the territory. Perhaps, also, he
felt that he could not claim the
assistance of his allies, in virtue of
the treaties of 1815; since, during
his reign, the government had always
been inclined to throw off the
yoke of those treaties. The late
ministry, in its endeavors to restore
France to her natural limits, had
excited distrust in the cabinets of
London, the Hague, Berlin, Vienna,
and Turin. It was not, therefore,
probable that these powers
would assist in restoring a government
which had placed itself in a
hostile position to them all, without
demanding, in return, ruinous sacrifices
and humiliating guarantees.
</p>

<p>
It is needful to look at things
from this point of view, in order to
appreciate the policy which was
followed at Holyrood. With foreign
governments few or no relations
were maintained; with the
interior, various correspondences,
the authors of which differed in
plans, in principles, and in views.
All were received, all were replied
to, in accordance with their various
ideas and modes of thinking. The
object was to offend no one, to
discourage no opinion, in the uncertainty
as to which opinion would
be the most useful.
</p>

<p>
Many excellent royalists, with the
most praiseworthy disinterestedness,
wrote to place at the disposal
of the king their hearts, their fortunes,
and their lives. If any means
were sought for to utilize these
generous offers, it was frequently
discovered that these worthy people
possessed neither money nor influence,
and that many of them were
advanced in years.
</p>

<p>
Others sent plans of conspiracies
which included three-fourths of
France, but with lists of names for
the most part unknown. They undertook,
they said, to cause Henry
V. to be proclaimed all over the
kingdom, provided Charles X. would
send them in advance sufficient
sums of money.
</p>

<p>
Some personages, who still figure
on the theatre of politics, took measures
to remit, with great precaution,
their offers of service. It is
worthy of remark that such notes
arrived each time there was any
rumor of revolt or any prospect of
war in foreign countries. These
offers were not expressed in as precise
terms as the preceding ones;
they were always accompanied by
conditions, of which the principal
ones were that the direction of the
movement in question should be
confided to no one excepting the
authors; that a provision should be
made of entire approval of the
<pb n='425'/><anchor id='Pg425'/>
measures upon which they might
decide; and, above all, that the
portfolios of the ministry of the
restoration should be ensured to
them. They alone, they asserted,
understood the needs of France
and the way to rule her. In a few
missives of another kind, some old
servants set forth the faults which,
in their opinion, the king had committed
during his reign, and ended
by offering him advice in case he
should regain the throne. Some of
these, irritated by what they considered
the oblivion of their former
services, permitted themselves to
utter bitter reproaches, without pity
for misfortunes the sight of which
should have been sufficient to disarm
even a just resentment. These
letters were received with perfect
indifference. There were, however,
demands which, by dint of their
audacity, obtained greater success.
</p>

<p>
A person wrote from Paris to one
of the servants of the king: <q>I am
about to publish a work which will
contain the account of various acts
of the government of Charles X.
You know that the offices I held
afforded me opportunities of knowing
many things; the revolution of
July has deprived me of my situation
and my pension; the public
loves scandal; the publishers will
pay a high price for it; and I will
furnish it to them unless I receive
thirty thousand francs, which I
cannot do without.</q>
</p>

<p>
If these are not the precise terms
of the letter, at least I am sure that
I have not altered the sense. The
author of this letter had been employed
under the Restoration; he
had received many favors from
both the last two monarchs; a
compromise was made with him.
I do not know what was the sum
sent, but I do know that the person
employed to mediate in this affair
was successful; the threatened work
was never published. Among the
offers of services which reached
Holyrood, some deserve particular
mention for their singularity.
</p>

<p>
A hero of July, famous during
the fatal days, and furious at not
having been able to obtain some
office, proposed to rally all the republicans
among his friends to the
cause of Henry V., and concluded
his epistle by announcing that he
would repair in person to the sea-coast,
and with his own hands
place the plank of debarkation beneath
the feet of the legitimate
heir to the crown.
</p>

<p>
A personage who has for a long
time figured under the Empire
had despatched to England a very
active agent, who offered, at the
same time, his services to the princes
of Holyrood, to the Duchesse
de Berri, and to the heirs of Napoleon;
meanwhile, the personage in
question was negotiating at Paris
with the republicans. The result
of this quadruple piece of diplomacy
was that he obtained employment
from the government of Louis
Philippe.
</p>

<p>
Already, during the period of
their former exile, had the august
occupants of Holyrood had but
too many opportunities to estimate
the real value of the offers, the
schemes, the demands, the pretext
for which was furnished by a projected
restoration, of a crowd
of ambitious and intriguing men.
Wearied, as it were, by the variety
of sentiments expressed towards
them, the obliging interest they
manifested was merely the effect
of an exquisite politeness. Unhappily,
in this indifference they
lost sight of real devotion to their
cause; they did not appear to
have made any very great progress
in the art of estimating men&mdash;an
<pb n='426'/><anchor id='Pg426'/>
art the ignorance of which had
been the cause of their second
downfall.
</p>

<p>
And, besides, in order to receive
these propositions with profit, to
give them a useful direction, it
would, first of all, have been necessary
that the most important political
point&mdash;that of legitimacy&mdash;should
be settled and proclaimed.
</p>

<p>
Those who have asserted that
there existed on this subject a
perfect unanimity of opinion among
the royal family and among their
advisers as to the right to the crown
in the present situation of affairs,
either have not known all the
truth, or else have concealed a portion
of it, in conformity with their
own political views. During his
residence at Holyrood, Charles X.
addressed to the principal courts
of Europe a confirmation of his
abdication at Rambouillet; but, besides
that this confirmation, being
declared <emph>free</emph>, indicates that the
abdication was always considered as
forced, and therefore null, Charles
X., in this second instrument, expressly
reserves to himself the regency
of the kingdom.
</p>

<p>
The dauphin, on the other hand,
positively refused to give a similar
declaration. <q>I sign nothing,</q> said
he; <q>not that I desire to dispute
with my nephew a crown of which I
am far from envying him the possession,
but, on the contrary, in order to
preserve it for him, in case the follies
which are being committed in
his name should render my reappearance
necessary.</q>
</p>

<p>
Lastly, in regard to the Duchesse
de Berri, no law, no historical precedent,
could have been found to
authorize her to consider herself
regent of the kingdom during the
minority of her son. Had not the
abdication of Charles X. been conditional,
and, besides, where could
there have been found a states-general
legally convoked to recognize
madame in this capacity?
</p>

<p>
The uncertainty on this point
became a source of discussion for
the various members of the suite.
The servants of the king, those of
the dauphin, and those of the Duc
de Bordeaux held many grave arguments
over their respective pretensions
to the title of the royal
household; but we must add that
these all ended in discussion. The
royal family, who lived together in
a sincere and patriarchal union, appeared
to take but little interest in
these various opinions; whether it
were that these unfortunate princes
believed it impossible for them at
this time to recover the crown, or
whether they regarded the possession
of it as something little desirable,
they frequently conversed
upon this subject as if it had been
a question of historic right foreign
to themselves. One opinion, one
feeling, however, united them all,
and this was that all rights to the
crown must one day centre upon
the head of Henry V., and that it
was necessary to educate him in
such a manner as to prepare him
worthily to sustain this high destiny
in case Providence should call
him to it.
</p>

<p>
Here we must speak of the education
which is being given to the
young prince under the direction
of the Baron de Damas. Much
good, and also some evil, has been
said of him. In the first place,
however, it appears to me that too
great importance has been attached
to his functions. In order that the
character of the governor should
have any decisive influence over
that of his pupil, it would be necessary
for the two to live in comparative
isolation. Perhaps, surrounded
by all the pomp of the Tuileries,
<pb n='427'/><anchor id='Pg427'/>
the fetters of etiquette might
have tended to produce such isolation;
but in the greater freedom
consequent upon exile, interruptions
of all kinds prevent this species
of influence. At all hours of
the day the Duc de Bordeaux is
receiving new and varied impressions.
He receives them from his
teachers, from his professors, from
his servants, from the strangers who
approach him, from the paternal
solicitude of his grandfather, from
the gentle piety of his aunt, from
the companionship of his young and
charming sister; he receives them
from his studies, from his exercises,
from his travels, from his recollections&mdash;in
short, from his misfortunes;
for he is of an age and of an
intelligence to understand and to feel
them. We must take into account
the combined influence of all these
diverse impressions, in order to
draw probable deductions as to the
profit he is one day to receive from
his present education.
</p>

<p>
At all events, if the Baron de
Damas does not possess very enlarged
ideas, his character is firm
and upright. For many things he
deserves commendation: he endeavors
to prevent all flatterers
from approaching his pupil; from
those by whom he is surrounded he
exacts nothing but sincerity and
cheerfulness. And then, he is careful
to admit to the presence of the
young prince, in unrestrained confidence,
all strangers, and especially
all Frenchmen, who desire access to
him, unless their request should be
prompted merely by the wish to
gratify an impertinent curiosity.
</p>

<p>
The office of M. de Damas has
been envied, and even sought after,
by some of those persons who style
themselves the courtiers of misfortune,
but who are perhaps merely
the courtiers of greatness expected,
or at least hoped for. But it may
reasonably be doubted whether this
governor could be replaced in a
manner advantageous to the young
prince. Among the notabilities of
the present epoch who might be
designated for this important position,
is there one who combines the
necessary qualifications? Would
we seek among the number of those
who, by their interested counsels
or by their calculated disaffection,
contributed to the overthrow of the
throne of Charles X., for men to
teach his grandson the art of restoring
and of preserving the
throne? Can we confide in these
system-mongers at a period like
this, when all systems have made
shipwreck? No; all that can be
done is to make of the young
prince a man of learning without
pedantry, of sincerity without indiscretion,
of courage without temerity.
In the present age, in
which everything indicates the
necessity of a power strong enough
to restrain the elements of anarchy
introduced by sophists into society,
in which the overthrow of ancient
institutions leaves to power only
the force it can obtain from armies,
what is chiefly to be desired in the
king of a nation like ours is military
qualities combined with liberality,
enlightenment, religion, prudence,
and justice. Now, none of
these conditions are wanting in the
education which is now being
given to the Duc de Bordeaux&mdash;neither
proper methods on the part
of the preceptors, nor the disposition
to receive on the part of the
pupil.
</p>

<p>
M. Barande, one of the most
learned men of our time, instructs
the young prince, with admirable
precision, in the facts of history,
combined with chronology and
geography. The Abbé de Meligny
<pb n='428'/><anchor id='Pg428'/>
explains to him with simplicity
the doctrines of religion. M.
d'Hardivilliers inspires him with a
taste for, and a knowledge of, the
fine arts. The first elements of the
science of war form the subjects of
his games and of his recreations.
Young Henri rides on horseback,
practises fencing, shoots with the
pistol, speaks and writes several
languages. His memory is unusually
excellent; his discernment is
beyond his age. The regular distribution
of his time gives him
habits of order and of diligence.
His health, watched over by Dr.
Bougon, is robust; his frame, fortified
by exercise, is strong and agile.
In a word, he is an intelligent,
sprightly, vivacious child, and yet,
withal, a reasonable one. There is
no mother who would not be proud
of him; no father whose every wish
would not be gratified by the possession
of such a son. Having thus
sketched his portrait, I do not intend
to imitate the enthusiasm of
those who have gathered up and
published his most unimportant remarks,
and have even, in their exaggerated
admiration, attributed to
him, possibly, speeches of their own.
</p>

<p>
At the sight of this royal child,
proclaimed, at the hour of his birth,
future monarch of a great empire,
and now entering upon his adolescence
in exile, this reflection naturally
presents itself: How if he
had never been born?
</p>

<p>
Had he not been born, probably
France would not have been disturbed.
The partisans of the
younger branch, certain of one day
attaining to power, would have had
patience; the republicans of July
would not have been able to enter
by the breach opened by the Orléanists
and the disaffected royalists.
His grandfather and his uncle
might have died upon the throne.
</p>

<p>
Had he not been born, and had
the double abdication still become
indispensable, Louis Philippe would
to-day be more firmly seated on his
throne than any monarch in Europe;
for in him would be found
resolved the great problem of the
union of fact and of right, of legitimacy
and of force.
</p>

<p>
Had he not bean born, ... but
he has been born, he is growing to
manhood, and in him are being developed
all the characteristic signs
of the rejuvenescence of his race.
In this age of tribulations and of
wonders, who may venture to sound
the abyss of the future?
</p>

<p>
This was what was said at Holyrood,
and it was added: <q>Did not
M. Odillon Barrot, when, in the
drawing-room at Rambouillet, he
executed the task assigned to him
of announcing to Charles X. the
hard decree of exile, pronounce the
memorable words: <q>Sire, watch
well over this royal child; one day
he will be of importance to the destinies
of France?</q></q>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>The Life of S. John of the Cross.</hi> By
David Lewis. New York: The Catholic
Publication Society. 1874.
</p>

</quote>

<p>
Mr. Lewis has certainly deserved well
of the inhabitants of Mount Carmel. His
translation of that incomparable gem, S.
Teresa's <hi rend='italic'>Autobiography</hi>; his truly splendid
work, the translation of the writings
of S. John of the Cross, and now his <hi rend='italic'>Life</hi>
of the latter saint, make up a series of
works for which English Catholic literature
is deeply indebted to him. The devoted
and enthusiastic interest which S.
Teresa, the Queen of Carmel, has inspired
in modern times is something wonderful,
though it cannot seem strange or surprising
to any one who is acquainted with
her history and capable of appreciating
her character. Happily for the world, S.
Teresa has found among her devotees
several both able and willing to make
her life and works known with an intelligent
and painstaking zeal for which we
cannot be too grateful. F. Bouix and
Canon Dalton are conspicuous among
these devout admirers of the modern glory
of Carmel who have labored so faithfully
and with so much pious and scholarly
learning and taste to diffuse the
light and fragrance of her sanctity and
doctrine. Mr. Lewis devotes himself
more especially to S. John of the Cross;
but it was really only a part of the
great work of S. Teresa which S. John
executed, both by his labors and his
writings. He was her spiritual son, the
chief instrument of carrying out the reform
with which she was inspired among
the friars of the order of Carmel; and in
his works he was, so to speak, S. Teresa's
theologian and expositor. Every one who
has been interested in S. Teresa's life
must have wished for a good life of S.
John of the Cross; and whoever has
tasted of the delicious fountain of divine
doctrine in his works must have desired
it still more. Such a life Mr. Lewis has
undertaken to give us, compiling it from
the older Spanish biographies. Mr.
Lewis's biography of the saint is short
and succinct, but very precise, accurate,
and complete in its narrative of facts
and events.
</p>

<p>
So far, it is what was wanted; and to
one who has learned to know the interior
life of S. John in his writings it is sufficient.
It is not, however, in itself, by
any means such a complete and adequate
portraiture of S. Teresa's counterpart and
companion as we possess of herself,
thanks to the happy thought of her confessor,
who obliged her to write her own
life, and to the devoted and affectionate
biographers who have supplied so fully
all that she herself omitted. The number
of those who will read this <hi rend='italic'>Life</hi> with
pleasure and profit must necessarily be a
comparatively small one. And we forewarn
all its readers, even devout Catholics
accustomed to reading the lives of
saints, that it requires a robust faith
to avoid being scandalized or frightened
by this one. S. John was most cruelly
persecuted and maltreated by his own
brethren and superiors of the Mitigated
Rule, and even by one unworthy prior of
the Reform. Moreover, the austerity of his
life and the additional sufferings which
God sent upon him may easily frighten
and dismay most of us, soft and effeminate
Christians as we are, when they are
looked at as presented in a dry historical
narrative, and apart from the inward
consolations, the supernatural graces,
the high contemplation, which made
trials and crosses sweet to this great and
heroic soul. We cannot, therefore, expect
this book to be a favorite with the
common run of even pious readers. But
those who are capable of enjoying and
profiting by it will be greatly rejoiced
that it has been written and published.

<hi rend='smallcaps'>What is Darwinism?</hi> By Charles
Hodge, Princeton, N. J. New York:
Scribner, Armstrong &amp; Co. 1874.
</p>

</quote>

<p>
There is a great deal of modest wisdom
in this small volume from the pen of one
of the most learned and accomplished of
<pb n='430'/><anchor id='Pg430'/>
the Princeton gentlemen. Dr. Hodge
chiefly aims at showing what the real
<emph>virus</emph> of Darwinism consists in, and finds
it to be the denial of final causes, or virtual
atheism. There is also a very good
summary of arguments against the theory
of evolution, and there are careful, well-studied
criticisms upon various writers
of distinction upon themes connected
with the author's topic. We are glad to
see that Dr. Hodge affirms the infallibility
of reason&mdash;that is, its possession of first
principles which are unerring, and its
capacity of attaining to the knowledge of
truth or true science. We do not approve,
however, of his definition of scientific
evidence as that which is attained
through the senses, or his distinction between
science and theology. It is most
important to maintain the rights of philosophy
and theology as the highest and
most certain of sciences, having supremacy
over all others. We suppose that
Dr. Hodge admits this in regard to the
things themselves, but we consider it
important to retain even the terms by
which the things are properly designated,
and to resist at all points the impertinent
as well as futile attempts of modern
scientists to dethrone the queen of the
sciences. The style and tone adopted by
Dr. Hodge in this volume are remarkably
quiet and moderate, and we trust that
this characteristic of his manner of arguing
with persons who are disposed to
lend an ear to the sophistry of modern
infidels will give it a readier access to
their minds. There is, however, an excess
of amiability in the praise which is
awarded to Mathilde Blind's <q>excellent
translation</q> of Strauss.
</p>

<p>
We recommend this book without hesitation
as one which, so far as it goes, is
satisfactory and likely to prove very
useful.

This brace of French novels, under one
cover, comes very opportunely at this
time, when careful teachers are on the
lookout for premiums which will be at
once attractive and safe to put into the
hands of their young charges, and summer
tourists are in search of literary
provender to stow away in their portmanteaus
and saddle-bags. Those who have
watched the progress of the stories
through these pages are aware that the
French literature which comes out under
Catholic auspices is very different from
that which reaches the public through
the secular press.
</p>

<p>
We are inclined to look on <hi rend='italic'>The Farm
of Muiceron</hi> as somewhat unique among
recent works of fiction. The writer, as
well as most of her characters, speaks
the language of the French peasantry;
and, if a more learned interlocutor is introduced,
the author frankly tells us
<q>not to expect her to explain the meaning
of the big words he uses.</q> Should
the reader thence conclude that the plot
is weak, and its evolution more so&mdash;in
fact, that he has taken up a goody-goody
book&mdash;he will speedily get rid of that
absurd idea before he proceeds very
far; and he will also be convinced
that the translation of such a work requires
peculiar qualifications. A knowledge
of classical French will not alone
suffice. An intimate acquaintance with
provincial modes of thought and expression,
and of such English equivalents for
the idioms as will best preserve their racy
flavor, are essential. This advantage we
are satisfied the present version has, as
the translator unites to a thorough knowledge
of her own tongue a practical familiarity
with the dialect intended to be
represented. Every linguist knows the
wonderful capabilities of the French language
in its delicate shades and modulations
of expression; and if the translation
fails to reproduce them, the fault
must be laid at the door of our unyielding
vernacular.
</p>

<p>
We do not intend to anticipate the
pleasure of the reader by any attempt to
analyze the contents of either story. Some
of the scenes of the second are laid in
the midst of the stormy days of July,
1848, and hence many of its descriptions
read like a page of contemporary history,
and its pictures of rustic life are full of
simplicity and pathos.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Madame Agnes</hi> will suit readers of a
more serious cast, or the same readers in
a different mood; and the two combined
may serve as light and shade to each
other. The solidity and gravity of the
one sets off the vivacity and <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>naïveté</foreign> of the
other. <hi rend='italic'>Madame Agnes</hi> is decidedly a
<pb n='431'/><anchor id='Pg431'/>
story of real life in its lifelikeness to
everyday experience, and its lessons
may, perhaps, the sooner find their way
to the reader's heart and conscience for
that reason.

Archbishop Manning's sermons are
plain, practical discourses in his usual
clear and masterly style. Bishop Hedley's
lectures give an exposition of the
Catholic doctrine of the Incarnation and
the principal heresies which have sought
to corrupt and subvert it, with an explanation
of redemption and the Real Presence.
They are both theological and

It has been said that a French novel is
either very bad or very good, and we are
glad to be able to place the one before us
in the latter category. It is the story of a
French family, the head of which, an
officer in Napoleon's grand army, with
his son, is taken prisoner during the
Russian campaign, and sent to Siberia.
No tidings having been heard from them
after the disastrous retreat from Moscow,
they are supposed to be dead, and the
mother and only daughter, a most amiable
and gentle girl, are thrown upon the
world in poverty and sickness. When
years have elapsed, and the ladies have
succeeded in winning an humble competence,
news arrives that the lost ones are
alive; so the mother and daughter set out
on a long and dangerous journey to effect
their release. How they fared in their
noble mission, and what dangers they
encountered on the way, will be best
learned from the book itself. The original
tale is written in excellent French
style, which is ever simple and fluent,
and the translation appears to have been
carefully made with proper regard to the
idiom of our vernacular.

Bernini had nothing to do with

the church. Michael Angelo completed
the piers of the dome, and made a wooden
framework on which to construct a dome;
but the dome was constructed by Giacomo
della Porta from designs of his own. The
edifice proper was finished by Carlo Maderno,
and on the plan of a Latin cross,
the suggestion of Bramante, overruling
Michael Angelo's suggestion of the form

<head>A Discussion With An Infidel.</head>

<p>
Dr. Louis Büchner's work,
<hi rend='italic'>Kraft und Stoff</hi>, first appeared in
Germany in the year 1855, and met
with such a favorable reception by
a numerous class of ignorant or
wicked progressionists<note place='foot'>In fact, <hi rend='italic'>Stultorum infinitus est numerus</hi>.</note> that from
that year up to the end of 1870 it
passed through ten German editions,
without counting the several translations
into other languages. The
present writer had lately the fortune,
or the misfortune, to be presented
with an English copy of this abominable
work,<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Force and Matter: Empirico-philosophical
studies intelligibly rendered by Dr. Louis Büchner,
President of the Medical Association of
Hessen-Darmstadt, etc., etc.</hi> Edited by J. Frederick
Collingwood. Second English edition.
London: Trübner &amp; Co. 1870.</note> and was informed
that the knights of the square and
the trowel had taken a special interest
in its propagation. It could
not be otherwise; for the work itself
is a masonic work. No one
who knows the true character of
freemasonry, and has read the book,
can have the least doubt of its masonic
origin. Only a mason of the
blackest dye could have displayed
such a cool effrontery, artful dishonesty,
and diabolic malice as the
author of <hi rend='italic'>Force and Matter</hi> did in
almost every page of his little volume.
Dr. Büchner is one of those
dangerous men who have a great
talent for perverting truth. He
knows how to dazzle the simple
with brilliant quotations, how to
perplex the acute with unanswerable
riddles, how to entangle the
cautious in a web of plausible objections.
He knows how to supplant
reason by rhetoric; and the
more embarrassing his case, the
greater is his assurance and the
higher his pretension. It is in the
name of science that he pretends to
speak. Such is the fashion just
now. Secret societies began their
open war against the church and
against God in the name of <hi rend='italic'>philosophy</hi>;
when beaten on this ground,
they appealed to <hi rend='italic'>liberality</hi>, then to
<hi rend='italic'>progress</hi>, then to <hi rend='italic'>civilization</hi>, and now
to <hi rend='italic'>science</hi>. All these words, on their
lips, were lies. Freemasons and
their cognate societies have never
<pb n='434'/><anchor id='Pg434'/>
been fond of real <q>philosophy,</q> and
never had truly <q>liberal</q> views.
The world never made any <q>progress</q>
in the right direction when
it followed them; their pretended
<q>civilization</q> never meant anything
else than the tyrannical subjugation
of the church by <q>civil</q>
powers. And now their <q>science,</q>
so far as it is theirs, is only a travesty
and prostitution of truth. The
world owes nothing to them except
the increase of crime, the loss of
public honesty, and the threatened
triumph of villany.
</p>

<p>
With Dr. Büchner, as with many
others of the same ilk, science is a
mere pretext. His real object is to
attack God's existence, a future life,
human liberty, and all those truths
which underlie sound philosophy,
morality, and religious belief. A
work so well calculated to do harm,
and which has already infected with
its poison a numerous class of readers,
needs refutation, and we will
engage in the unpleasant task. We
hope we shall be able to show that
Dr. Büchner's <hi rend='italic'>Force and Matter</hi>, all
its pretensions notwithstanding, is,
in a philosophical point of view, a
complete failure. One ounce of
truth and a cartload of lies is just
what the doctor dispenses to his
benighted admirers throughout the
pages of his baneful production.
</p>

<p>
To make things clearer, and to
give Dr. Büchner the best opportunity
of speaking for himself, we
have thought of putting the whole
discussion in the form of a dialogue
between the doctor and ourselves.
We know that a lengthy conversation
with such a sworn enemy of
truth may prove disgusting in a
high degree, as he will utter nothing
but sophisms or blasphemies. But
the sophist must be unmasked and
the blasphemer confounded. We
hope our readers will excuse us for
paying such attention to an infidel
writer; we would have ignored him
altogether, if his work were not as
dangerous as it is unworthy of a
doctor.

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Indeed, doctor, I fear
that your <hi rend='italic'>Force and Matter</hi> will
make you a bad reputation. Our
most esteemed philosophers say
that you are a sophist, and that a
man of your attainments cannot be
a sophist but by deliberate choice.
They evidently imply that you are a
knave and an impostor. As for myself,
I confess that I do not see the
cogency of your reasonings; but,
before declaring you a knave and
an impostor, I should like to hear
from your own mouth what you
may have to say in your behalf.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> I am not surprised, sir,
at anything said against me. When
I published my work, <q>I knew that
my attempt was bold, and that I
should have to sustain a fierce
struggle with the prejudices of the
age</q> (p. viii.) But <q>things cannot
be represented different from
what they <emph>are</emph>; and nothing appears
to me more perverse than the efforts
of respectable naturalists to
introduce <emph>orthodoxy</emph> in the natural
sciences</q> (p. xvii.) You say that
our most esteemed philosophers call
me a sophist. You mean the schoolmen,
of course; in fact, the scholastic
philosophy, still riding upon
its high though terribly emaciated
horse, conceives that it has long ago
done with our theories, and has consigned
them, ticketed <hi rend='italic'>materialism</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>sensualism</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>determinism</hi>, etc., to the
scientific lumber-room, or, as the
phrase goes, has assigned them their
<hi rend='italic'>historical value</hi>. But this philosophy,
my dear sir, sinks daily in the
<pb n='435'/><anchor id='Pg435'/>
estimation of the public, and loses
its ground (p. xviii.)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I would remark, with
your permission, that the public is
not nowadays a very acute judge
of these matters. For what does
the public know of scholastic philosophy?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> By the public I mean
the scientific world, sir.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> The scientific world,
dear doctor, knows very little of
scholastic philosophy. I am sure
you will not deny the fact. Can
you tell me where, when, for how
many years, under what professors,
and in what books, your scientific
men had an opportunity of studying
scholastic philosophy? They have,
no doubt, heard something of it&mdash;just
enough to realize the fact that
there was a science in the world of
which they were profoundly ignorant.
But this gives them no right to pass
a judgment. I venture to say that
neither you nor Moleschott, Feuerbach,
Darwin, Tuttle, Huxley, or
any of your school, have ever studied,
or consulted, or perhaps even
so much as touched with your
hands, a single volume of scholastic
philosophy.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> This may be; but it is
quite enough for us to know that
<q>the singular attempts of the old
school to construe nature out of
thought instead of from observation
have failed, and brought the adherents
of that school into such discredit
that the name of natural
philosopher has become a byword
and a nickname</q> (p. xix.)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> No, doctor. This is not
true. The name of natural philosopher
is still much respected and
revered; and I trust nothing will
ever succeed in making it despicable,
except, perhaps, the shameless
usurpation of it made by your
friends, the free-thinkers, whose
philosophy is nothing but a mean
conspiracy against truth. It is
their fault, indeed, if the name of
natural philosopher is sneered at
when connected with their own persons.
Why should they put on a
garb which fits them not? If you
call Moleschott or Darwin natural
philosophers, every one certainly
will smile; but call Ampère or Faraday
by this name, and you will see
every one take down his hat in
sign of respect and approbation.
Then, you should not imagine that
because a few discoveries have been
lately made by our men of science
(I say <emph>a few</emph>, because most of them
are only new applications of old
theories, while many others are
mere hypotheses), you should not
imagine that we have acquired the
right to despise the discoveries
and the wisdom of all past ages.
It was our forefathers who created
modern science. Where would you
be without a Kepler, a Galileo, a
Newton, and scores of others, who
laid down the ruling principles of
all the branches of science? If
they knew less than we do about
empirical manipulations, they knew
a great deal more about the conditions
of legitimate speculation.
To construe nature <q>out of thought
instead of from observation</q> has
never been their method; if I wished
to retaliate, I could easily prove
that it is yours.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner</hi> (<hi rend='italic'>defiantly</hi>). Try, sir.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Well, since you challenge
me, I shall ask you whether it is
from observation, and not out of
thought, that you have construed
your <q>uncreated</q> matter. I know,
and you also know, that it is only
<q>out of thought.</q> But we shall
have time to do justice to this and
other topics. The point I now insist
on is, that what you say of the
scholastic method of <q>construing
<pb n='436'/><anchor id='Pg436'/>
nature</q> is a rank calumny. Understand
me, doctor. Natural
science has two objects in view:
the first is to ascertain the truth
about natural facts; the second is
to discover the nature of the principles
and causes to which such facts
must be traced. As the first of
these two objects is attained by observation
and experiments, so is the
second by thought&mdash;that is, by reasonings
based on the positive results
of observation and experiment.
Now, you must admit that the duty
of the metaphysician is not to make
observations or experiments. This
belongs to the physicist. The
metaphysician accepts the facts as
ascertained by the physicist; and
it is from such facts, not from
thoughts, that he starts his speculation
on the nature of things. Of
course, if the physicist be wrong in
his statement of facts, the metaphysician
will be led astray and build
a theory without foundation; yet
the fault will not be his. And if the
physicist be ignorant of some important
law of nature, the metaphysician
will be compelled to supply
for the law with a guess at a probable
hypothesis. This is in the nature
of things. With a mutton-chop
you cannot make roast beef,
can you?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> No, indeed.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I mean that our forefathers
had not at their disposal
such an abundance of means for
investigating the secrets of nature
as we now possess. Certainly, the
most important of such secrets, before
the time of Copernicus, were
inaccessible to the metaphysicians.
I allow, then, that the theory of the
scholastics remained incomplete,
and was most imperfect so long as
universal attraction was unknown
and chemistry undeveloped. But
this proves nothing. The imperfection
of the old physics gives you
no right to affirm that the schoolmen
construed nature out of thought.
Speculation always implies thought;
but to start one's speculations from
the data of observation, as it was
customary with the scholastic philosophers,
is not to reject observation.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> I demur to this statement,
sir. It is well known that the
old school was all grounded on the
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>à priori</foreign> method.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Certainly not, my dear
doctor. One cannot reason without
abstract principles; but when
such principles are the result of experimental
knowledge, it would be
folly to pretend that they constitute
an <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>à priori</foreign> method of construing
nature out of thought instead of
from observation. Do you demur
to this also?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> What I assert, sir, is
that <q>the times of the scholastic
bombast, of philosophical charlatanism,
or, as Cotta says, of intellectual
jugglery, are passing away</q>
(p. xix.)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> You are not serious,
doctor. First of all, you know nothing
about scholastic bombast.
Were you to read one page of any
of our great scholastic doctors, you
would be amazed at the simplicity
of their style, and at the utter recklessness
of your allegation. In the
second place, the times of bombast
and charlatanism are not passing
away. Read Huxley. Can you
find anything more bombastic than
his <hi rend='italic'>Lay Sermons</hi>? Read Darwin.
Is he not a philosophical charlatan?
Read your own <hi rend='italic'>Kraft und
Stoff</hi>....
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Brilliancy is not charlatanism,
sir. It is a fact that
while the pretended high speculations
of the old school are hopelessly
unintelligible, our discoveries,
<pb n='437'/><anchor id='Pg437'/>
<q>by directing investigation to
facts, have compelled thought to
leave the misty and sterile regions
of speculative dreams, and to descend
to real life</q> (p. xxii.) Can
you condemn us for this? <q>It lies
in the nature of philosophy that it
should be common property. Expositions
which are not intelligible
to an educated man are scarcely
worth the ink they are printed with.
The philosophical mist which envelops
the writings of scholars appears
intended more to conceal
than to exhibit their thoughts</q> (p.
xix.)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> It is all a mistake, doctor.
If you reflect for a moment
on your oracular sentences, you
will see that they are mere nonsense.
You say that it lies in the
nature of philosophy that it should
be common property. I wonder if
this can be true. I fancy that philosophy,
like any other science or
discipline which is acquired by
study, is the property of those
alone who have studied it; and I
hope that no man of sense will contest
such an evident truth. You
say that philosophical expositions
should be intelligible to every <emph>educated</emph>
man; but this is true only on
the assumption that the education
of which you speak includes a thorough
training in philosophy; which,
unfortunately, is not the case with a
great number of so-called educated
men. You say that whatever is
clearly conceived can be clearly
expressed; but you forget that
what is clearly expressed for the
scholar may still be obscure to the
uninitiated. Is it possible that a
doctor like you, and a president of
a medical association, should overlook
the fact that every science has
a number of technical terms and
scientific phrases which must be
learned in special books and by
special study before its speculations
can be comprehended? It is
therefore supremely ridiculous to
talk of <q>the mist that envelops the
writings of scholars.</q> Everything
is misty to the uninstructed. Let
him study, and the mist will disappear;
for it is not the doctrine that
wants clearness, but it is the eye of
the ignorant that is blurred.
</p>

<p>
And now, what shall I say of
that pompous phrase of yours, that
modern discoveries <q>have compelled
thought to leave the misty
and sterile regions of speculative
dreams, and to descend to real
life</q>? I hope you will allow me
to call it <q>modern bombast</q> and
<q>philosophical charlatanism</q>; for
I cannot call it by any other name.
If you mean by such words to denounce
Kant, Hegel, Schelling, and
other German dreamers of the
same school, I have nothing to say
in their defence; but if you intend
thereby to stigmatize the Catholic
schools, to which you Germans, no
less than the rest of the civilized
world, owe your intellectual education,
I cannot help saying, dear doctor,
that your hostile insinuations are
dictated by malice and hatred of
truth. Why do you defame what
you know not? How can you call a
<emph>sterile</emph> region that speculative philosophy
which formed all our great
men? or <emph>dreams</emph> those evident conclusions
against which reason cannot
rebel without slaying itself?
Is not this very strange in a doctor?
You were confident that <q>intellectual
jugglery,</q> to use Cotta's
expression, would be stronger than
historical truth; but we are quite
prepared to meet you on this
ground as on others; for we Catholic
thinkers are not afraid of
bombastic words. We do not even
think that your <q>jugglery</q> is at all
<q>intellectual.</q> For is it intellectual
<pb n='438'/><anchor id='Pg438'/>
to make sweeping assertions
when you can give no proofs? Or
is it intellectual to sneer at your
opponents, instead of replying to
their arguments? I presume, dear
doctor, that your freemasons alone
would see anything intellectual in
such a proceeding.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> You imagine, sir, that
I must be a freemason. I shall not
answer that, as it has nothing to do
with my book. Yet I wish to inform
you that freemasonry everywhere
favors the progress of <q>modern
science</q>; and therefore I
would not object to being called a
freemason, whether I am one or
not. But as to making assertions
of which I give no proofs, I defy
you, sir, to substantiate the charge;
and as to my not replying to my opponents,
I am sure you will modify
your judgment when you examine
the prefaces to the various editions
of my work.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I accept the challenge.
It will not be more difficult to give
you full satisfaction on these two
points than it has been to rebut
your flippant denunciations of the
scholastic philosophy.
</p>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>II. Tergiversation And Jugglery.</head>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> You say, then, that in
the prefaces to the various editions
of your work you have replied to
your opponents.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Certainly I do.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I have read all your
prefaces. In the very first you
make this declaration: <q>We will
not be in want of opponents; but
we shall only notice those who
speak from experience and combat
us with facts</q> (p. xx.) This
amounts to saying: <q>When we
shall be attacked with any sort
of arms, arrows, pistols, knives,
swords, guns, and sticks, we shall
not defend ourselves except against
sticks.</q> Against sticks, of course,
you may defend yourself by the
use of other sticks; but, if you are
attacked with artillery, will your
sticks be to you a sufficient protection?
You knew very well, when
publishing your book, that you
were to be attacked with <emph>reasons</emph>.
To declare that you would notice
only those adversaries who
would attack you with <emph>facts</emph> was to
declare that you were not ready to
meet your real opponents.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Against fact there is no
reasoning.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> This is not the question.
It is true that against fact there is
no reasoning; but when we argue
against your false conclusions, we
do not attack your facts, but your
sophisms only, most erudite doctor.
</p>

<p>
Then you add that <q>speculative
philosophers may fight among
themselves from their own point of
view, but should not delude themselves
into the belief that they
alone are in possession of philosophical
truth</q> (p. xx.) These
words reveal your tactics, which
are: <q>Let them fight among themselves,
and not against me; but if
one of their number attacks me,
and I cannot hold my ground, let
him know that, if he is right, I also
am right; for he is not alone in
possession of philosophical truth.</q>
This is, doctor, the silly plan of defence
you have adopted and carried
out against the attacks of Catholic
philosophers. How can you,
then, pretend that you have answered
your opponents? I mean
your real opponents.
</p>

<p>
When the <hi rend='italic'>Frankfurter Katholische
Kirchenblatt</hi> took you to task
for your impious and absurd publication,
what did you answer?
Here are your words: <q>We shall
<pb n='439'/><anchor id='Pg439'/>
pass over the fierce denunciations
of the <hi rend='italic'>Frankfürter Katholische
Kirchenblatt</hi>, conducted by the
parish priest, Beda Weber. The
melancholy notoriety which that
individual has acquired, as one of
the most eccentric of the ultramontane
party, permits us simply to
dismiss him. We shall only tell
the reader that the <hi rend='italic'>Frankfürter
Kirchenblatt</hi> carries its hatred
against the modern direction of
science so far as to recommend the
application of the criminal law
against its representatives. The
public may thus learn what these
gentlemen are capable of, should
they ever become possessed of
power. The same bloody hatred
with which science was once persecuted
by religious fanaticism
would revive anew, and with it
the Inquisition, and <foreign rend='italic'>auto-da-fés</foreign>, and
all the horrors, with which a refined
zealotism has tortured humanity
would be resorted to, to satisfy the
wishes of these theological cut-throats.
We must turn from these
enemies, quite unworthy of a serious
refutation, to another opponent</q>
(p. xxiii.) Here, then, you confess
that you have cowardly turned your
back to the enemy.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Cowardly?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Yes. If you do not like
the word, I will say <emph>prudently</emph>. In
fact, the reason you allege&mdash;that
such an enemy was unworthy of
serious refutation&mdash;is a miserable
pretext. Whoever is not blind can
see that your furious declamation
against Beda Weber was an impudent
attempt at crushing, if
possible, by insults, the man whom
you could not defeat with reasons.
It is mean and disgusting. What
can your readers say when you
dare not even let them know Beda
Weber's objections, on the plea
that the reverend priest <q>has acquired
a melancholy notoriety as
one of the most eccentric of the
ultramontane party</q>? If such is
the verdict of the masonic lodges,
we cannot but congratulate Beda
Weber for the compliment paid to
him. His very <q>hatred against the
modern (<hi rend='italic'>masonic and infidel</hi>) direction
of science</q> shows that he is
a man of sound and clear judgment;
and his opinion that <q>the
criminal law</q> should be applied
against the atheists and the corruptors
of youth recommends him
to us as a man of order and a true
friend of civil society; for nothing
is more necessary for the preservation
of order and the peace of
society than the enforcement of
law. When such men make denunciations,
they should not be
<q>simply dismissed,</q> dear doctor.
Religious fanaticism, refined zealotism,
tortures of humanity, persecution
of science, and the rest,
even if they were not thread-bare
lies, would not authorize you to
<q>simply dismiss</q> a learned opponent
as unworthy of serious refutation.
I will say nothing about
that malicious insinuation concerning
<q>what these gentlemen are
capable of, should they ever become
possessed of power.</q> Were they
capable of any monstrosity, this
would not help your defence of
<hi rend='italic'>Force and Matter</hi>. But those gentlemen
have been possessed of power
for ages, and the nations redeemed
from barbarism, and enriched with
monuments of art, and with scientific,
literary, and charitable institutions,
show <q>what they were
capable of.</q> Of course freemasonry
is capable of something else; a
glance at the present deplorable
condition of Germany suffices to
show what <emph>you</emph> are capable of when
you are possessed of power. But,
I repeat, were we as wicked, in
<pb n='440'/><anchor id='Pg440'/>
your opinion, as you are in fact,
this would be no reason for not
answering our arguments. Your
book is an attack against religion.
The professors of religion are therefore
your natural opponents. It is
to <emph>them</emph>, therefore, that you owe
your explanations. And yet this
is what you publicly profess yourself
unable to do.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> I never made such a
profession.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> You made it very openly.
<q>With regard to parsons and
ecclesiastics,</q> you say, <q>who never
cease to enlighten and to assail us
with their eloquence, we beg to repeat
that we cannot discuss with
them</q> (p. lxiv.) Of course you
endeavor to cover your retreat, as
usual, by pretending that <q>these
good people have, from the beginning
of the world, had the privilege
of using their zeal and ignorance
in crying down everything that does
not suit their business</q> (<hi rend='italic'>ibid.</hi>); but
this vile language only betrays your
inability to cope with them. You
are so generous as <q>not to disturb
them in their vocation,</q> because
<q>no rational man doubts the total
incapacity of these gentlemen to
enter upon such questions</q> (p.
lxv.)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Why should I answer
them? They are mere theologians;
and I maintain that <q>there is no
theological or ecclesiastical natural
science, and there will be none so
long as the telescope does not
reach the regions where angels
dwell</q> (p. lxv.)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> This is a very poor
excuse, dear doctor. Theologians
are not debarred from dealing with
natural sciences. To mention no
others, Copernicus was a canon;
Secchi is a Jesuit; Moigno is a
priest. Moreover, the subject of
the question is not natural science,
but your sophistry; and you cannot
deny that ecclesiastical studies
make men competent to judge
of logical blunders. But, leaving
all this aside, did you not try
to refute the <hi rend='italic'>Allgemeine Zeitung</hi>,
though you pretend that <q>in struggling
with such pen-heroes, it
seems to you that you are acting
like Don Quixote</q> (p. xxviii.)?
Did you not fight, also, against Mr.
Karl Gutzkow, although he, <q>as
is well known, has never impeded
the daring flight of his genius by
the ballast of science</q> (p. xxix.)?
And, to omit others, did you not
do your best to answer the <hi rend='italic'>Allgemeine
Kirchen Zeitung</hi>, although it
meets you, as you say, <q>with theological
eccentricity and rodomontades</q>
(p. xxxvii.)? It would
appear, then, that you are not
afraid of accepting battle when you
have any hope of overcoming your
adversary. And therefore, when
you shrink from answering your
Catholic opponents, it is evident
that you do so only because with
them you have no hope of success.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> You are quite mistaken,
sir.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> No, indeed. I am certain
that you cannot hold your
ground against a Catholic opponent,
and I am ready to show you immediately
that such is really the
case. I have already told you that
your <hi rend='italic'>Force and Matter</hi> is a book full
of sweeping assertions, of which no
proof is given. You challenged me
to substantiate the charge, and I
have accepted the challenge. I
say, then, that your very first proposition,
on which all the other
arguments employed in your work
are ultimately based, is one of those
assertions of which no proof is or
can be given. Do you accept the
battle on this ground?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> I do.
</p>

<pb n='441'/><anchor id='Pg441'/>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Please, then, what do
you consider to be the fundamental
proposition of your work?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> It is this: <q>No matter
without force, and no force without
matter</q> (p. 2).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Is this proposition altogether
universal, so as to admit of
no possible exception?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Yes, sir, absolutely universal,
without any possible exception.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Then please tell me on
what grounds such an absolute universality
can be established.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> On many grounds.
First, as Dubois-Reymond profoundly
remarks, <q>fundamentally
considered, there are neither forces
nor matter. Both are merely abstractions,
assumed from different
points of view, of things as they
are. They supplement and presuppose
each other. <hi rend='italic'>Separately they
do not exist.</hi> Matter is not like a
carriage, to which the forces, like
horses, can be put or again removed
from. A particle of iron is, and
remains, the same, whether it
crosses the horizon in the meteoric
stone, rushes along in the wheel of
the steam-engine, or circulates in
the blood through the temples of
the poet. These qualities are
eternal, inalienable, and untransferable</q>
(pp. 1, 2).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I would remark that the
qualities of matter are not eternal.
Of course, as long as matter continues
to exist, its essential constitution
must remain intact; but to
say that the qualities of matter are
eternal is to assume not only that
matter will last for ever, but also
that it has existed from all eternity.
Science has no right to make this
assumption, since it has no means
of ascertaining its truth; for evidently
eternity does not come
under observation and experiment.
But leaving aside this question,
which we may examine later, I say
that your quotation from M. Dubois
does not account for the universality
of your proposition.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Hear Moleschott: <q>A
force not united to matter, but
floating freely above it, is an idle
conception</q> (p. 1).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> This is a mere assertion.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Hear Cotta: <q>Nothing
in the world justifies us in
assuming the existence <foreign rend='italic'>per se</foreign> of
forces independent of the bodies
from which they proceed and upon
which they act</q> (p. 2).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> This is no proof. It is
quite clear that those forces <hi rend='italic'>which
proceed from the bodies</hi> cannot be
independent of the bodies. But
your proposition is that no force
<emph>whatever</emph> can exist without matter;
and therefore you should prove
that <emph>all</emph> forces, without exception,
are dependent on matter.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> First of all, we must
admit that there is no matter without
force. <q>Imagine matter without
force, and the minute particles of
which a body consists without that
system of mutual attraction and
repulsion which holds them together,
and gives form and shape to
the body; imagine the molecular
forces of cohesion and affinity removed;
what then would be the
consequence? The matter must
instantly break up into a shapeless
nothing. We know in the physical
world of no instance of any particle
of matter which is not endowed
with forces by means of which it
plays its appointed part in some
form or another, sometimes in connection
with similar or with dissimilar
particles. Nor are we in imagination
capable of forming a conception
of matter without force.
In whatever way we may think of
an original substance, there must
<pb n='442'/><anchor id='Pg442'/>
always exist in it a system of mutual
repulsion and attraction between
its minutest parts, without
which they would dissolve and
tracelessly disappear in universal
space. A thing without properties
is a non-entity, neither rationally
cogitable nor empirically existing
in nature</q> (pp. 2, 3).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Very good so far. But
this is no recent discovery; it is
an old truth constantly taught, and
much more exactly expressed, by
those schoolmen whom you imagine
to have been <q>the persecutors
of science.</q> Thus far, then, you
have only rehearsed the old doctrine.
But now you have to show
that, as there is no matter without
force, so also there is no force
without matter.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Yes. <q>Force without
matter is equally an idle notion.
It being a law admitting of no exception
that force can only be
manifested in matter, it follows
that force can as little possess a
separate existence as matter without
force</q> (p. 3).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Take care, doctor! You
are now assuming what should be
proved. You assume a law, <hi rend='italic'>admitting
of no exception</hi>, that force can
only be manifested in matter.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> The law is known.
<q>Imagine an electricity, a magnetism,
without the iron or such
bodies as exhibit these phenomena,
and without the particles of matter,
the mutual relation of which is just
the cause of these phenomena;
nothing would then remain but a
confused idea, an empty abstraction,
to which we have given a
name in order to form a better conception.
If the material particles
capable of an electric condition
had never existed, there would
have been no electricity, and we
should never have been able by
mere attraction to acquire the least
knowledge or conception of electricity.
Indeed, we may say electricity
would never have existed
without these particles. All the so-called
imponderables, such as light,
heat, electricity, magnetism, etc.,
are neither more nor less than
changes in the aggregate state of
matter&mdash;changes which, almost like
contagion, are transmitted from
body to body. Heat is a separation,
cold an approximation, of the
material atoms. Light and sound
are vibrating, undulating bodies.
Electrical and magnetic phenomena,
says Czolbe, arise, as experience
shows, like light and heat
from the reciprocal relation of
molecules and atoms</q> (pp. 3, 4).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Have you done?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Is this all your proof?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Then allow me to state
that you have not shown what
you promised. You have proved,
indeed, that the forces of matter
exist nowhere but in matter;
but as every one admits this,
there was no need of your proof.
Your duty was to prove the universal
proposition, <hi rend='italic'>no force without
matter</hi>; and therefore you
had to show that there are no
other forces than the forces of
matter.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> This is evident; as
<q>force can as little exist without a
substance as seeing without a visual
apparatus, or thinking without
an organ of thought</q> (p. 4).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I am afraid, doctor,
that you do not speak to the point.
The question is not whether a
force can or cannot exist without a
substance; it is, whether there is
no other substance than matter.
Before denying the existence of
force without matter, you must
<pb n='443'/><anchor id='Pg443'/>
conclusively show that all substance
is matter.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>Nothing but the
changes we perceive in matter by
means of our senses could ever
give us any notion as to the existence
of powers which we qualify
by the name of <hi rend='italic'>forces.</hi> Any knowledge
of them by other means is
impossible</q> (p. 4).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I should be glad to
know how you can infer from such
a remark that all substance is matter.
What you perceive in material
objects proves, indeed, the existence
of matter and of the forces
of matter; but how does it prove
the non-existence of other substances
and of other forces? You,
surely, imagine that our senses are
our only source of knowledge, and
that the supersensible, as unknowable,
must be consigned to the region
of dreams.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Certainly. <q>We maintain
that human thought and human
knowledge are incapable of
discovering or knowing anything
supersensual. This is the necessary
general result of modern investigation</q>
(p. xli.)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> A curious result indeed!
By which of your senses do you
perceive abstractions, such as <hi rend='italic'>philosophy</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>morality</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>affirmation</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>veracity</hi>?
I put you the alternative:
either show that you touch, hear,
smell, taste, or see, with your material
eyes, any of such abstract
notions, or confess, according to
the general result of your ridiculous
modern investigations, that you can
have none of such notions, and are
essentially incapable of reasoning.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> You try to draw me
out of the real question, sir.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> By no means. It is
your denial of our capability of
knowing anything supersensual
that draws us out of the question.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> My object was to show
that there is no matter without
force, and no force without matter.
This proposition can be established
without any special reference to
our mental operations.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> You may try; on condition,
however, that our knowledge
of the supersensible be not
called in question.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> The science of force is
<hi rend='italic'>physics</hi>. <q>This science makes us
acquainted with eight different
forces: gravitation, mechanical
force, heat, light, electricity, magnetism,
affinity, cohesion, which,
inseparably united to matter, form
and give shape to the world</q> (p.
18). Any force which cannot be
reduced to a combination of these
forces is therefore to be looked
upon as chimerical. Nothing is
more evident.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Evident? I think, doctor,
if I were you, I would be
ashamed of uttering such a rank
sophism. You beg the question
altogether. What right have you
to assume that there are no real
forces in the universe but those
mentioned in our physical treatises?
To assume this is to assume
that there is nothing in the world
but matter&mdash;the very thing which
you should demonstrate. And
therefore you are as far as ever
from having shown your universal
proposition, <hi rend='italic'>no force without matter</hi>.
Indeed, you will never show
it. Truth is stronger than you.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Then tell me, sir, on
what ground do you base your belief
in the existence of supersensual
forces?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Excuse me, doctor.
We were not discussing the question,
<q>What are my grounds for
believing their existence?</q> Our
question was, <q>What are your own
grounds for proclaiming their non-existence?</q>
<pb n='444'/><anchor id='Pg444'/>
When a man makes
an assertion contrary to the common
belief, it is his duty to give
good reasons in its support. If
he cannot, let him give up his assertion,
and go back to the common
belief. Common beliefs, on
the contrary, are in no need of
special demonstration so long as
they are not attacked with plausible
reasons. That there are supersensual
forces is a common belief.
As you have failed to adduce any
serious proof to the contrary, this
common belief remains unshaken.
You ask on what grounds I base
my belief. I might answer that I
base it on the ground of universal
consent, and I might show that this
universal consent must have a universal
foundation, which cannot be
invalidated. But I will tell you a
special reason for admitting supersensual
forces. It is that there are
facts which cannot be accounted
for by the forces of matter.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> What fact? Do you
mean the exploded fact of creation?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I will soon come to the
fact of creation, if you wish, and
compel you to swallow back your
nasty epithet. But the fact I alluded
to was that the phenomena
of consciousness and of volition are
unaccountable, if there is nothing
besides material forces. This you
cannot deny; for you say you
<q>cannot but acknowledge that in
the relation of brain and soul, phenomena
occur which cannot be explained
from the simple physical relation
of force and matter</q> (p. lxiv.)
As long, therefore, as you admit
nothing but matter and material
force, there are facts which, by your
own confession, cannot be explained.
Thus, you see, not only have
you failed to substantiate your fundamental
assertion, <hi rend='italic'>no force without
matter</hi>, but you are constrained, on
your own showing, to admit forces
that transcend matter.

<head>III. Creation.</head>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> You say, doctor, that
creation is an <emph>exploded</emph> fact. May
I ask why?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>Those who talk of a
creative power, which is said to
have produced the world out of itself,
or out of nothing, are ignorant
of the first and most simple principle,
founded upon experience and
the contemplation of nature. How
could a power have existed not
manifested in material substance,
but governing it arbitrarily according
to individual views? Neither
could separately-existing forces be
transferred to chaotic matter, and
produce the world in this manner;
for we have seen that a separate existence
of either is an impossibility</q>
(p. 5).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I beg to remind you that
we have <emph>not</emph> seen the impossibility
of force without matter. All your
efforts to show it have been vain.
It is childish, therefore, on your
part, to pretend that those who talk
of a creative power <q>are ignorant
of a first principle founded upon
experience and the contemplation
of nature.</q> The contemplation of
nature is, on the contrary, the ladder
by which rational creatures ascend
to the knowledge of the Creator.
You ask: How could a power
have existed not manifested in material
substance? I answer by another
question: How could the
world have existed, if no such power
exists? This is the real question
at issue. And pray, doctor, do not
speak of separately-existing forces
transferred to chaotic matter. This
is not the way we account for the
<pb n='445'/><anchor id='Pg445'/>
production of the world. We do
not admit of chaotic matter before
creation. And again, do not suppose
that we can ever dream of a
Creator producing the world out of
himself. We are not pantheists;
and we know that the world has
been produced out of nothing. This
is the true notion of creation according
to both theology and philosophy.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Very well. But <q>the
world could not have originated out
of nothing. A nothing is not
merely a logical, but also an empirical
non-entity. The world, or matter
with its properties, which we
term forces, must have existed from
eternity, and must last for ever&mdash;in
one word, the world cannot have
been created</q> (p. 5).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> These are bold assertions
indeed. How can you make
them good?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>The notion <q>eternal</q>
is certainly one which, with our
limited faculties, is difficult of conception.
The facts, nevertheless,
leave no doubt as to the eternity
of the world</q> (p. 5).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> What facts, if you please?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Here is one fact:
<q>That the world is not governed,
as is frequently expressed, but that
the changes and motions of matter
obey a necessity inherent in it,
which admits of no exception, cannot
be denied by any person who
is but superficially acquainted with
the natural sciences</q> (p. 5). Now,
if the world is not governed by a
superior power, we cannot make it
dependent for its origin on any superior
power. This leaves no
doubt as to the eternity of the
world.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I wonder, doctor, if you
have ever learned or understood
the first principles of philosophy.
Young students may teach you that,
from the necessity to which matter
is subjected of obeying certain laws
of motion, it is absurd to infer the
necessity of its existence. What is
subject to obedience is not independent,
and what has a necessity of
obeying is essentially dependent.
Moreover, do you not see that what
is subject to change cannot be necessary,
and cannot be eternal?
You appeal to natural sciences.
This is ridiculous. There is no
need of modern sciences to know
that the phenomena of the material
world follow an invariable law.
This was known in all past ages;
yet no man in his senses has thought
of concluding that therefore matter
was a necessary being. Pagan philosophers,
who had lost the primitive
traditions of mankind, admitted
uncreated matter without further
examining the question; but
none of them pretended to prove
the eternity or necessity of matter
from its subjection to definite laws
of motion. The absurdity of such
a deduction is manifest. Suppose
a geometrician were to argue thus:
What follows an invariable and
necessary law exists from eternity;
but every triangle follows this invariable
and necessary law: that the
sum of its angles equals two right
angles; and therefore every triangle
exists from eternity. What
would you reply?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> I would reply that the
laws of geometry are mere abstractions.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> And so are all physical
laws also. When a thing exists, it
cannot but be what it is according
to its essence. If it is a figure of
geometry, it exists according to
geometric laws, and has its geometric
properties; and if it is a material
substance, it cannot but have
the properties of matter, and so
long as it exists it cannot but retain
<pb n='446'/><anchor id='Pg446'/>
the same properties. This is evident.
But from the fact that a
thing existing is necessarily subject
to the laws of its nature you cannot
conclude that it necessarily exists,
unless, indeed, you are not even
superficially acquainted with the
laws of reasoning. Hence it is clear
that your argument has no weight.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>But that a power&mdash;taken
for the once in its abstract
sense&mdash;could only exist so long as
it is active is no less clear. In assuming,
therefore, a creative absolute
power, a primeval soul, an unknown
x&mdash;it matters not what name
we give it&mdash;as the cause of the
world, we must, in applying to it
the notion of time, say that it could
not have existed either <emph>before</emph> or
<emph>after</emph> the creation. It could not
have existed <emph>before</emph>, as the notion
of power is not reconcilable with
the idea of nothing or inactivity.
It could not have been a creative
power without creating something.
We must, therefore, suppose that
this power has for a time been inert
in the presence of chaotic and motionless
matter&mdash;a conception we
have already shown to be absurd.
It could not have existed <emph>after</emph> the
creation, as rest and inactivity are
again incompatible with the notion
of force. The motion of matter
obeys only those laws which are inherently
active; and their manifestations
are nothing but the product
of the various and manifold accidental
or necessary combinations
of material movements. At no
time and nowhere, even in the
most distant space reached by our
telescope, could a single fact be established,
forming an exception to
this law, which would render the
assumption of a force external, and
independent of matter, necessary.
But a force which is not manifested
does not exist, and cannot be taken
into account in our reasoning</q> (p.
6). What do you answer, sir?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I answer that this pretended
argument cannot entrap
any one but an ignorant man, or
one who desires to be cheated or to
cheat himself. And first I observe
that you begin by surmising that
the Creator would be <q>an abstract
power</q>; now, the surmise is an absurdity.
Secondly, you suppose that
we <q>assume</q> a creative absolute
power&mdash;which is not the case; for
we do not assume its existence, but
we prove it. Thirdly, you call the
Creator <q>a primeval soul, an unknown
<hi rend='italic'>x</hi></q>; and both expressions
are very wrong indeed. Fourthly,
you say that we must apply to the
Creator <q>the notion of time</q>&mdash;which
is sheer folly; as every one
knows that time has no existence
but in the successive changes of
created things. Even you yourself
say that <q>the mere application of a
limited notion of time to the creative
power involves a contradiction</q>
(p. 7). And therefore, when you
affirm that the creative power
<q>could not have existed either <emph>before</emph>
or <emph>after</emph> creation,</q> you commit
a great blunder by assuming that
before creation there should have
been time. But leaving aside all
this, and supposing that the phrase
<q>before the creation</q> may be understood
in a legitimate sense as
expressing the priority of eternity
and not of time, I will come directly
to your argument.
</p>

<p>
You say that a creative power
could not exist before creation,
<q>as the notion of power is not reconcilable
with the idea of nothing
or inactivity.</q> This reason proves
nothing, except, perhaps, your ignorance
of logic. Try to reduce
your argument to the syllogistic
form, and you will see what it
amounts to.
</p>

<pb n='447'/><anchor id='Pg447'/>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> The syllogism will
run thus: A power can exist only
as long as it is active. But the
creative power before the creation
was not active. Therefore the
creative power could not exist before
the creation. I hope this
proves something else than my ignorance
of logic.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> And yet your logic is
sadly at fault. Do you not see the
equivocation lurking in the middle
term? What do you mean by <hi rend='italic'>active</hi>?
Does this word stand for
<hi rend='italic'>acting</hi>, or for <hi rend='italic'>able to act</hi>? If it
stands for <hi rend='italic'>acting</hi>, then your major
proposition is false; for a power
exists as long as it is able to act,
although it is not actually acting.
This is clear; for have you not
a power of talking as long as you
are able to talk, although you may
actually be silent? If, on the contrary,
the word <hi rend='italic'>active</hi> stands for
<hi rend='italic'>able to act</hi>, then it is your minor
proposition that will be evidently
false; for the creative power, before
the creation, was able to create
the world, although we conceive
it as not yet creating anything.
Hence your nice syllogism is a
mere sophism, and your conclusion
a blunder.
</p>

<p>
Your other assertion, <q>It could
not have been a creative power
without creating something,</q> is
likewise sophistical. For the epithet
<q>creative</q> in your argumentation
means <q>able to create</q>; and consequently
it does not entail actual
creation, but only its possibility.
Thus the blunder is repeated.
</p>

<p>
But you proceed: <q>We must,
therefore, suppose that this power
has for a time been inert in the
presence of chaotic or motionless
matter.</q> In these few words I
find three mistakes: First, you
again introduce time where there
can be nothing but eternity; secondly,
you assume that a power
not exercised is inert&mdash;which is
false, because inertness means destitution
of self-acting power; thirdly,
you put chaotic and motionless
matter in the presence of the creative
power before this power has
been exercised&mdash;which is to assume
that chaotic matter was not
created, but only received movement.
You understand, doctor,
that in arguing, as you do, from
the point of view of your adversaries,
you cannot take such liberties.
If you wish to refute creation, you
must take it as it is understood
and defended by its supporters; or
else you will only refute your own
hallucinations. But I will not insist
on these latter remarks. I
made them only that you may better
realize how deficient and miserable
is your method of reasoning.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner</hi> (<hi rend='italic'>bitterly</hi>). Thank you
for the compliment.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> However, I have more
to say; and I hope, doctor, that
you will not lose your temper, if I
proceed onward in the same strain.
In the second part of your argument
you say that the creative
power <q>could not have existed
<emph>after</emph> the creation, as rest and inactivity
are again incompatible
with the notion of force.</q> This is
evidently a mere reiteration of the
sophism just refuted. If the reason
you allege had any weight, it
would follow that, when you have
ceased curing a patient, your medical
power would vanish, and,
when you have ceased talking,
your talkative power would be extinct;
in fact, rest and inactivity,
according to you, are incompatible
with the notion of power. I say
<q>power,</q> although you here make
use of the word <q>force,</q> which is
calculated to mislead your readers.
The word <q>force</q> is frequently
<pb n='448'/><anchor id='Pg448'/>
used to express a quantity of
movement; and, of course, rest and
movement exclude one another;
hence to designate the creative
power by the name of <q>force</q>
may be a dishonest trick, though a
very clumsy one, to inveigle readers
into the belief that rest and creative
power are incompatible. Here,
however, I must point out another
great blunder, which a man of your
talent should have been able to
avoid. There is a truth, doctor,
of which you seem to be quite ignorant,
though certainly you must
have heard of it more than once.
It is that the creative power, after
the production of creatures, does
<emph>not</emph> remain inactive. Creatures
need positive conservation, and
would fall into nothingness were
they not continually kept in existence
by the same power by which
they have been first brought into
being. Hence the creative power
is always at work. What is, then,
your supposition of its inactivity
but a new proof of your ignorance?
</p>

<p>
What you add concerning the
motion of matter has no importance.
I might admit with you that, prescinding
from miracles (which you
are blind enough to deny), <q>at no
time and nowhere, even in the most
distant space reached by our telescope,
could a single fact be established
which would render the assumption
of a force external, and independent
of matter, necessary.</q>
This, however, regards only the
stability of the laws of motion; and
it would be absurd to infer that
therefore the existence of matter
and its conservation need not be
accounted for by an external cause.
But you again give a proof of your
ignorance by adding that <q>the
motion of matter obeys only those
laws which are inherently active.</q>
What does this mean? Try to understand
the term <q>law,</q> and you
will see that to call law <q>inherently
active</q> is an unpardonable nonsense.
And hoping that this suffices
to show the absolute worthlessness
of your pretended argument, I
will let you go on with your other
allegations.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> You do not reflect, sir,
that in your theory the creative
power must have been idle for an
eternity; and this cannot be admitted.
For <q>to consider the
power in eternal rest, and sunk in
self-contemplation, is an empty arbitrary
abstraction without any empirical
basis</q> (p. 6).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Not at all, doctor. To
consider God in eternal rest is not
an empty arbitrary abstraction; it
is a real and necessary conclusion
from incontrovertible premises. Is
it philosophical to assume, as you
do, that creation would likely put
an end to God's eternal rest? God
always rests unchangeably in himself,
whether he actually exercises
his creative power or not. He has
in himself his happiness, and in
himself he rests for ever independently
of creation. This we say
without thinking for a moment of
your <q>empirical basis.</q> For we
know that it is a silly thought, that
of endeavoring to find an empirical
basis for a purely intellectual truth.
But if by the want of an empirical
basis you mean a want of known
facts from which to show God's existence
and infinite perfection, then
your duty would have been to substantiate
your assertion by showing
that such facts are not real facts, or
have no connection with the existence
of a supreme being. This
you have omitted to do, and thus
all your argument consists of bold
assertions, not only without proofs,
but without the possibility of proof.
</p>

<p>
Is it not strange, then, that you
<pb n='449'/><anchor id='Pg449'/>
fancy to have cornered your readers,
and compelled them to resort to
the most absurd fictions to uphold
the existence of a creative power?
You say, in fact, that they have no
other resource but to admit <q>the
singular notion that the creative
power had suddenly and without
any occasion arisen out of nothing,
had created the world (out of
what?), and had again, in the moment
of completion, collapsed within
itself, and, so to say, dissolved
itself in the universe</q> (p. 7). Indeed,
were we as stupid as any
creature can be, we would still find
it impossible to dream of such a
foolish assumption. You add that
<q>philosophers and others have ever
cherished this latter notion, believing
that they could, by this mode
of reasoning, reconcile the indisputable
fact of a fixed and unchangeable
law in the economy of
the universe with the belief in an
individual creative power</q> (<hi rend='italic'>ibid.</hi>)
I do not hesitate to tell you, doctor,
that nothing but hatred of truth
could prompt you to utter such a
gross lie.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Yet <q>all religious conceptions
lean more or less towards
this idea</q> (p. 7).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> This I deny.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Let me explain. Philosophers
admit the idea, <q>with
this difference: that they conceive
the spirit of the world reposing
after the creation, but yet, as an
individual, capable of again suspending
his own laws</q> (p. 7).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> This explanation is not
to the point. Your assertion implied
that philosophers and others
ever cherished the notion that the
creative power had suddenly arisen
out of nothing, and that all religious
conceptions lean more or
less towards this idea. This is
what I challenged you to show.
Does your explanation show it?
On the contrary, it shows that the
idea towards which religious conceptions
lean is quite different.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Be this as it may,
<q>conceptions of this kind cannot
concern us, not being the result of
philosophical reasoning. Individual
human qualities and imperfections
are transferred to philosophical
notions, and belief is made to
occupy the place of actual knowledge</q>
(p. 7).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I perceive, doctor, that
you are persistently wrong. It
seems as though you could not
open your mouth without uttering
some false or incongruent assertion.
What are those conceptions which
<q>cannot concern us</q>? Are they
not the dreams you have just imagined?
How, then, do you insinuate
that the existence of a
creative power does not concern
us, because your dreams are not
the result of philosophical reasoning?
And pray, who ever <q>transferred
individual human qualities
and imperfections to philosophical
notions</q>? Has this phrase any intelligible
meaning? Lastly, it is
evidently false that, in order to
admit a creative power, <q>belief is
made to occupy the place of actual
knowledge.</q> The existence of
God is a philosophical truth; now,
philosophy is a method of knowledge,
not of belief.
</p>

<p>
I trust I have sufficiently exposed
your <q>intellectual jugglery</q> to
let you see that you are at best a
charlatan, not a philosopher.

<head>Dante's Purgatorio. Canto Fourteenth.</head>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This canto, like the preceding (XIII.), illustrates the sin of envy, which Dante deems a
special vice of the Florentines, against whom and the other inhabitants of Valdarno he inveighs
with a bitterness that savors more of the style of the Inferno than of <q>the milder shade of Purgatory.</q>
</p>

<p>
In the Thirteenth Canto, Envy has been rebuked by voices of love and gentleness; as, for instance,
the kindly comment of the Virgin at the marriage feast of Cana, <q><hi rend='italic'>They have no wine</hi>.</q> These and
similar words are the <hi rend='italic'>scourge</hi> which the envious have to endure. But the <hi rend='italic'>bridle</hi>, Dante says, are
tones of a contrary import, such as the terrific voice of Cain, who passes by in a peal of thunder,
but invisible, followed by the dreadful cry of Aglauros, described in the concluding paragraph of
this canto.

<p>
Lorenzo, Duca di Valenzano,
belonged to one of the noblest
families of upper Italy; but his
mother was a native of Sicily, and
it was from her he inherited his
title as well as the fortune already
in his possession, which would be
considerably increased if an important
lawsuit (the usual accompaniment
of a Sicilian inheritance),
which brought a great part of it
into litigation, should terminate
successfully. His object in coming
to see my father was to place this
business in his hands; and, after
his first visit, he usually came once
or twice a week. At first he merely
bowed to me as he passed, or, at
most, addressed me a few words on
leaving the room. The remainder
of the time was spent in looking
over voluminous documents with
my father. Nevertheless, these
visits soon became a little incident
in my monotonous life, and I began
to look forward to them with a
certain impatience.
</p>

<p>
The duke, at this time, was
scarcely more than thirty years of
age; but he by no means seemed
young in my eyes. A few premature
wrinkles and an observant,
thoughtful look imparted a gravity
to his face which was not, however,
its prevailing expression; for it was
frequently ironical and sarcastic to
the last degree, and so mobile that
it was not always easy to decide on
the impression it left. His general
appearance, however, was noble
and striking, as well as the tone
of his voice, which involuntarily
commanded attention to all he
said.
</p>

<p>
Several weeks elapsed without
any other variety than the few
moments, more or less prolonged,
which he passed at my table at the
end of each visit. He generally
made some unimportant remarks
respecting my lessons, my bird,
or my flowers, which he noticed
I cultivated with a care somewhat
unusual in our clime. In fact,
he only spoke to me as he would
to a child. I replied in a corresponding
tone, and, very soon,
not only without embarrassment,
but with a pleasure I made no attempt
to conceal. I had begun to
be devoured by <foreign rend='italic'>ennui</foreign> in so inactive
and solitary a life, and I eagerly
welcomed any diversion that
came in my way. My father, at
such times, remained silent and
grave, and seemed somewhat impatient
when these brief conversations
were prolonged a little more
than usual.
</p>

<p>
One day, when the duke approached
my table as usual, I had
a large atlas open before me, and
he noticed that I was examining
the map of Asia. I was studying
without any effort, and yet with a
certain interest resulting from curiosity
which, added to an excellent
memory, made me an unusually
good scholar. The duke looked
at the map a moment, and, after
some observations that excited my
interest, he pointed to a place near
<pb n='455'/><anchor id='Pg455'/>
the Himalaya mountains, and remarked:
<q>One year ago to-day I
was there.</q> I knew his extensive
travels had rendered him celebrated,
as well as his success as a
sculptor, doubly surprising in a
man of his rank and so enterprising
an explorer. I had acquired
this information from conversations
respecting the duke since his arrival
at Messina, where his presence
had caused a sensation.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion, seeing my interest
strongly excited, he seemed
to take pleasure in giving an account
of that remote region, which
I sometimes interrupted by questions
that appeared to surprise him.
The facility with which I was endowed
made me really superior in
many respects to most girls of my
age; and as for information, I
might have been considered a phenomenon
in my own country.
</p>

<p>
The conversation that day might
have been indefinitely prolonged
had not my father found a pretext
for abridging it by suddenly proposing
to take the duke to the further
end of the garden, in order to
examine some ruins and a Greek
portico on a height from which
there was an admirable view. The
duke looked at me, as if he wished
I could join in the walk; but my father
not seconding this mute suggestion,
he was forced to accompany
him, not, however, without giving
me, as he left the room, a look that
seemed to express compassion, interest,
and respect.
</p>

<p>
As soon as I was alone, I abruptly
closed my atlas, rose from my
seat, and abandoned myself to a
violent fit of irritation and grief, as
I hurried with long steps through
the extensive gallery, exclaiming
aloud against the undue sternness
and severity of my father.... He did
not see that he was thus rendering
the seclusion he had imposed upon
me beyond my strength to bear&mdash;a
seclusion that would have been
transformed by one word of affection,
sympathy, or even kindness.
Instead of this, did he not even appear
to be annoyed that I should
receive any from this stranger?
</p>

<p>
It was impossible for me to resume
my studies. I had an hour
to wait before Ottavia would come,
as she did every day, to accompany
me to the garden&mdash;as
if I were a mere child, instead
of being allowed to wander at my
own pleasure till sunset. Hitherto
I had endured everything humbly;
but my patience was now exhausted,
and I felt a disposition to revolt
which I only repressed with
difficulty. Was this merely against
a <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>régime</foreign> of such excessive severity,
or was it the result of a slight return
of confidence in myself inspired
by the interest, and almost deference,
which this stranger had just
manifested? It was doubtless both;
and the consequence was, I felt an
agitation I could not subdue, and
an irrepressible longing for any
change whatever in a mode of life
that had become insupportable.
Tired of walking up and down, I at
last took a seat by the window,
where I could, at a distance, see my
father and his client. I watched
them with an attention that soon
diverted my thoughts and ended by
wholly absorbing me.
</p>

<p>
I at once noticed that, instead of
proceeding to the end of the garden
to see the ruin my father had
spoken of, they had stopped in a
broad alley leading from the house
to a white marble basin, in the form
of a vase, which stood in the centre.
This alley, bordered with a clipped
hedge of box, extended beyond the
basin to a small grove of olive-trees
leading to the hill it was necessary
<pb n='456'/><anchor id='Pg456'/>
to ascend in order to see the ruin.
They seemed to have wholly lost
sight of the proposed object of their
walk; for when I first saw them, they
had scarcely reached the basin, and
were now slowly returning towards
the house. The duke appeared to
be listening to my father, every now
and then striking the hedge they
were passing with a stick he held in
his hand. All at once he stopped,
and, passing his arm through my father's,
he led him to a bench, on
which they both sat down. I could
see them distinctly, and, without
hearing what they said, could distinguish
the sound of their voices.
It was the duke's I now heard. At
first he spoke with his head bent
down, as if with some hesitation,
but by degrees with more animation
and fire, and finally with clasped
hands, as if pleading some cause or
asking some favor.... Once he
raised his eyes towards the window
where I was, though he could not
see me. Was he speaking of me?...
Had he ventured to intercede in
my behalf?... I looked at my father
anxiously. His face expressed
the greatest surprise as well as
extreme dissatisfaction, but it gradually
changed. He became very attentive;
and when at last the duke
extended his hand, he took it in his,
and seemed to be making some
promise. Then they rose and resumed
the way to the house, but by
a shady path where my eyes could
no longer follow them.
</p>

<p>
That day our dinner was less
gloomy than usual. My father
conversed with Mario as he had
not done for a long time, and the
latter, with satisfaction, attributed
to himself this change (which, to do
him justice, had been the object
of persevering effort). But Livia,
who had more penetration, saw
there was some other reason; for
she speedily observed that this
change was especially evident towards
me. In fact, for the first
time since the fatal day that seemed
like a dividing line in my young
life, I once more saw in my
father's eyes the fond look I was
formerly accustomed to; and this
paternal and almost forgotten expression
gave me new life and a
sensation of joy and happiness that
made me raise my head as a flower
beaten down by the storm looks up
at the first return of the sun.
</p>

<p>
The explanation was not long
delayed. The next day my father
sent for me at an earlier hour than
I generally went to him, and after
a preamble which I scarcely comprehended,
and which by no means
served to prepare me for what I
was about to hear, he informed me
that the Duca di Valenzano had
asked for my hand. I remained
stupefied with astonishment, and
my father continued: <q>It was
impossible to expect a proposal
like this for one of my daughters;
but however brilliant it may be, I
should unhesitatingly decline it
were not the duke personally
worthy of love and esteem. As to
this I am satisfied from all I hear
respecting him. But it is for you
to decide about accepting his hand.
I will not impose my will on you.
Consider the subject, Ginevra.
The Duca di Valenzano will come
this evening to receive your reply.</q>
</p>

<p>
My father might have said much
more without my thinking of interrupting
him. I was in such a
state of utter amazement that I
could hardly realize what he said,
and the perspective thus suddenly
opened before me conveyed no
definite idea to my mind. It was
easier to believe he was jesting
with me than to suppose such a
<pb n='457'/><anchor id='Pg457'/>
man as the duke would propose for
me to become his wife!...
</p>

<p>
I returned to my chamber extremely
agitated, and this feeling
was not diminished by witnessing
my sister's emotion and Ottavia's
noisy demonstrations of joy when
I told them of the proposal that
had just been communicated to me.
The Duca di Valenzano was not
only a person of high rank, but he
was thought to possess every accomplishment,
and it was evident
that every one looked upon my
consent as a matter of course.
</p>

<p>
<foreign rend='italic'>Un homme accompli!</foreign> Before going
any further, I cannot help
stopping to remark here to what
a degree the world, generally so
severe, shows itself indulgent in
certain cases; and how often this
indulgence is shared even by those
who try to think they are not influenced
by external circumstances!
Assuredly neither my father, nor
my sister, nor the simple Ottavia
attributed the favorable impression
produced on their minds to the
brilliant position of this unexpected
suitor, or the special merit he
had acquired in their eyes, to the
mere fact of his having thought of
sharing his lot with me.
</p>

<p>
It would have been difficult for
me to express my own feelings, for
I hardly understood their nature.
I was flattered; I was touched; I
was even very grateful, for it was
evident that the duke had begun by
pleading my cause with my father,
and hitherto he had been by no
means unpleasing to me. Why,
then, could I not think of him now
without a kind of repugnance, fear,
and aversion? And why did I
feel as if I should prefer never to
see him again? I asked myself
these questions, at first silently, and
then aloud, as was often my habit
when with Livia and Ottavia,
who, though so different from each
other, were nevertheless so alike in
their affection for me.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is quite natural, <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>carina</foreign>,</q>
replied Livia. <q>You scarcely know
the Duca di Valenzano, and the very
word <hi rend='italic'>marriage</hi> is one of serious import,
and even fearful, when it falls
for the first time on the ears of a
young girl. But this will pass
away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you think so?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! yes. I am sure of it.
When you know him better, and
especially when he, in his turn,
comprehends the qualities of your
mind, and heart, and soul, he will
conceive such an affection for my
dear Ginevra that she will soon
love him in return, and not a little,
I imagine.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think so, too,</q> said Ottavia,
laughing. <q>They say he is very
captivating, to say nothing of his being
one of the greatest and wealthiest
noblemen of Italy. Ah! ah!
what a different tone those wicked
people will assume who say....</q>
</p>

<p>
Livia looked at Ottavia, who stopped
short.
</p>

<p>
<q>Livia! do not stop her,</q> I exclaimed.
<q>Go on, Ottavia; I insist
upon it. I wish to know what
wicked people you refer to, and
what they say.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ottavia once more regretted her
precipitation, and would rather
have remained silent; but I continued
to question her till she acknowledged
some people had taken
the liberty of saying I should never
marry on account of <q>what had
taken place.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What a vague, cruel way of
speaking!</q> exclaimed Livia indignantly.
<q>Everybody knows now
there was nothing, absolutely nothing
at all, in that gossip; that it
was all a mere falsehood.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Everybody?</q> ... I said with
<pb n='458'/><anchor id='Pg458'/>
sudden emotion. <q>But has not my
father continued to treat me as if I
were culpable?</q> Then after a moment's
silence, I added: <q>Do you
think these falsehoods have come
to the ears of the Duca di Valenzano?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How can I tell?</q> replied Livia.
<q>And of what consequence is it?
His proposal shows that he is sure,
as well as we, that you have nothing
at all to reproach yourself for.</q>
</p>

<p>
I made no reply. A new thought
struck me, and I felt the necessity
of being alone, in order to reflect on
what had been suggested by her
words. I therefore left my two
companions abruptly, and took a
seat at the end of the terrace on a
little parapet that looked on the
sea, and there I remained nearly an
hour.
</p>

<p>
That night, when the Duca di
Valenzano returned, my father, at
my solicitation, told him that, before
coming to any decision, I wished
to have some private conversation
with him. It was not without difficulty
I induced my father to convey
this message; but the duke immediately
assented, and with so
much eagerness that it might have
been supposed my request had only
anticipated a wish of his own.
</p>

<index index='toc'/>

<head>VIII.</head>

<p>
I was in my usual place in the
gallery, and alone, when the duke
entered at the appointed hour. I
rose, and extended my hand. He
was astonished, I think, to find me
so calm, and perhaps so grave,
and looked at me a moment in silence,
as if he would divine what I
was going to say to him. Seeing
that I remained silent, he at length
said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Donna Ginevra, I thought myself
skilled in reading the expression
of your eyes; but in looking at
you now, I cannot tell whether the
word that is about to fall from
your lips is yes or no.</q>
</p>

<p>
I found it difficult to reply; but
overcoming my embarrassment at
last, I succeeded in saying:
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes or no?.... If I only had
that to say, M. le Duc, I could
have charged my father with it....
But before speaking of the
reply I am to make, I must make
one request. You must tell me
sincerely what you think of me, and
I will afterwards tell you with the
utmost frankness wherein you are
mistaken.</q>
</p>

<p>
He looked at me with an attentive
air, and then smiled, as he
said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell you what I think of you?...
That might lead me to say more
than I have yet the right to say.
But I will tell you, Donna Ginevra,
what I do not think, and, in so doing,
I shall, I imagine, comply with your
request. Let me fully assure you
I attach no importance whatever to
the words of a coxcomb; and I
would call any one a liar, and treat
him as such, who would dare to repeat
them!...</q>
</p>

<p>
He saw, by the expression of joy
that flashed from my eyes, that he
had guessed aright.
</p>

<p>
<q>Poor child! ... poor angel!</q>
he continued, <q>it would be strange
indeed if I took any other attitude
than this before you.</q> And
he was about to kneel at my feet,
when I eagerly prevented him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do not do that, I beg of you!</q>
I exclaimed. <q>And say, if you
like, that I am a child, but do not
call me an angel.... Oh! no,
never say anything so far from the
truth! Listen to me, for I requested
<pb n='459'/><anchor id='Pg459'/>
this interview only that
you might know all&mdash;what is true
as well as what is false.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is true?</q> he said in a
slight tone of surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes. Listen to me. I thank
you for not having believed what
... what was said concerning
me, for that, indeed, was false. I
am, however, culpable, and it is
right you should know it. Perhaps
you will then change your mind,
and think no more about me.</q>
</p>

<p>
He looked at me again, as if he
would read the depths of my soul.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it with this design,</q> he said,
<q>that you speak so frankly?</q>
</p>

<p>
I knew not what reply to make,
for I no longer knew what I
wished. I found a charm in the
mingled tenderness and respect of
which I so suddenly felt myself the
object. Besides, I had suffered
greatly from my long seclusion, and
my heart involuntarily turned towards
him who was trying to deliver
me from it.... My fear and
repugnance vanished beneath his
sympathetic look.
</p>

<p>
<q>No,</q> I said at last, <q>it is not
for that reason.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then speak frankly,</q> he said,
<q>and let me hear this important
revelation, whatever it may be.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And will you promise solemnly
never to reveal my secret?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I solemnly promise.</q>
</p>

<p>
In spite of the solemnity of his
words, I saw it was with difficulty
he repressed a smile. But when
he saw the agitation produced by
the recollections thus awakened,
his expression became serious. For
a moment a cloud came over his
face; but in proportion as I entered
into the details of that last night
of my mother's life&mdash;my thoughtlessness,
my shock, and, finally, my
despair and repentance&mdash;he became
affected, and listened with so much
emotion that his look inspired me
with confidence, and I finished
without fear the account I had begun
with a trembling voice.
</p>

<p>
As has been seen, I thought
myself more guilty than I should
have been had there been any
truth in the vague, unmerited reproaches
I had endured; for the
slight fault I had really committed
seemed indissolubly connected with
the fearful calamity that followed!...
That was why I thought
myself unpardonable, and why I
preferred to endure the most unfounded
suspicions concerning me
rather than reveal the truth to any
one in the world&mdash;above all, to my
father. But it seemed to me I
ought not, for the same reason, to
conceal it from him who had so
generously offered me his hand,
whatever might be the result. I
therefore continued, and he listened
without interrupting me. When
I had ended, he spoke in his turn,
and what he said decided the fate
of my life.
</p>

<p>
I already felt relieved by the
complete revelation of a secret I
had hitherto kept with an obstinacy
that was perhaps a little childish.
And in listening to the soft
accents of his sonorous, penetrating
voice, my heart was more and
more comforted, and soon allowed
itself to be persuaded into what it
was sweet and consoling to believe&mdash;that,
as he said, I exaggerated
the consequence of my thoughtlessness;
that if I had afflicted my
mother, I had time to ask and obtain
her forgiveness; that I was
ignorant of her dangerous condition,
and, when I became aware
of it, I supposed I had been the
cause; ... but all this was unreasonable....
And as to the flower....
Here he stopped, and his
brow darkened for a moment. <q>Answer
<pb n='460'/><anchor id='Pg460'/>
me frankly,</q> he said slowly;
<q>if Flavio Aldini were still alive,
if he were here under this window
to-day, and implored you to give
him that little sprig of jasmine I
see in your belt....</q>
</p>

<p>
He had not time to finish.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it possible,</q> I exclaimed,
<q>you, who say you understand
me, who pretend to have read my
heart, can mention a name that has
become so odious to me?...</q>
</p>

<p>
Then I continued, I imagine to
his great surprise:
</p>

<p>
<q>You are the first to whom I
have acknowledged the fault he
made me commit, for I do not
consider the ear of the priest to
whom I confessed it as that of
man. There I experienced the indulgence
of heaven, and was forgiven
by God as well as my mother....
But would you know what
cost me the most that day? Not,
certainly, my sorrow for the past;
not my firm resolutions as to the
future; nor even the humble acceptation
of all the humiliations
that have been inflicted on me....
No, what cost me the most was to
promise to overcome my resentment,
to subdue the bitterness
awakened by the very name of
Flavio, and to utter it every day
in prayer for the repose of his
soul!...</q>
</p>

<p>
I was, in speaking thus, very remote
from the regions familiar to
Lorenzo. While I was uttering
these words, my face was lit up
with an expression very different
from any he had ever seen there.
He gazed at me without seeming
to hear what I said, and at length
replied with evident emotion:
</p>

<p>
<q>I thank you for telling me
this, though one look at you is sufficient
to efface all doubt, as darkness
vanishes before the approach
of day.</q>
</p>

<p>
After a moment's silence, he resumed:
<q>And now, Ginevra, I
implore you to delay no longer the
reply I have come to receive.</q>
</p>

<p>
The recollections of the past
had made me forget for a few moments
the present; but these words
recalled it, and I looked at him
as if confounded. There was a
moment's silence. My heart beat
loudly. At length I silently took
from my belt the little sprig of
jasmine he had just spoken of, and
gave it to him.
</p>

<p>
He understood the reply, and
his eyes lit up with gratitude and
joy. I felt happier than I had anticipated.
Was not this, in fact,
what I had dreamed of, what I
had longed for&mdash;to be loved? And
would it not be easy to love in return
such a man as this?
</p>

<p>
As these thoughts were crossing
my mind, and I lowered my eyes
before his, he suddenly said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know how beautiful
you are, Ginevra?</q>
</p>

<p>
At these words I frowned, and a
blush rose to my forehead which
once might have been caused by
gratified vanity, but now was only
occasioned by sincere, heart-felt
displeasure. <q>Never speak to me
of my face, I beg of you,</q> I said to
him, <q>unless you wish to annoy or
displease me.</q>
</p>

<p>
He looked at me with the greatest
astonishment, though he felt
no doubt as to my perfect sincerity,
and, taking my hand in his,
said:
</p>

<p>
<q>You are a being apart, Ginevra,
and resemble no one else in any
respect. It will be difficult sometimes
to obey your request, but I
will do so.</q>
</p>

<p>
Had I been able to read Lorenzo's
heart, I should, in my turn,
have been astonished, and perhaps
frightened, at the motives that had
<pb n='461'/><anchor id='Pg461'/>
induced him to link so suddenly
his life with mine.
</p>

<p>
The beauty of which I was no
longer vain; the talents I possessed
without being aware of it; the
strangeness of finding me in a kind
of captivity, and the somewhat
romantic satisfaction of delivering
me from it and changing my condition
by a stroke of a wand&mdash;such
were the elements of the attraction
to which he yielded; and if it had
occurred to any one to remind him
that the girl who was about to become
his wife had a soul, he would
very probably have replied by a
glance of surprise, a sarcastic smile,
or a slight shrug of his shoulders,
as if to say: <q>Perhaps so, but it
does not concern me.</q>
</p>

<p>
It happened in this case, as
often happens in many other circumstances,
that a word, a look, or
the tone of a voice impresses, persuades,
and influences, and yet
(perhaps for the happiness of the
human race) does not reveal the
inner secrets of the soul.
</p>

<p>
My engagement was announced
the next day, and the last of May
appointed for the marriage. There
was a month before the time&mdash;a
month the remembrance of which
still stands out in my life like a
season of enchantment. The restored
confidence of my father,
joined to the thought of our approaching
separation, had revived
all the fondness of his former affection.
Lorenzo had succeeded in
making him regret the excess of his
severity towards me. Indebted to
him, therefore, for the return of my
father's love as well as the gift of
his own, he seemed like some beneficent
<foreign rend='italic'>genie</foreign> who had dispersed every
cloud, and restored to my youth the
warm, golden light of the sun. I
thanked him for this without any
circumlocution, and sometimes in
so warm a manner that he must
have been the most unpresuming
of men to suppose me indifferent
to the sentiments he so often expressed,
though not so ardently as
to disturb me. He respected the
request I made the first day. He
suffered me to remain the child I
still was, in spite of having experienced
such varied emotions. Perhaps
the strong contrast he thus
found in me formed a study not
devoid of interest to a man <foreign rend='italic'>blasé</foreign> by
all he had seen and encountered in
the world.
</p>

<p>
The preparations for so brilliant
a marriage completely filled up the
time of the busy Ottavia, who was
charged by my father to omit nothing
in the way of dress requisite
for the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>fiancée</foreign> of the Duca di Valenzano.
Mario, prouder than he
was willing to acknowledge of an
alliance that reflected lustre on
the whole family, showed himself
friendly and satisfied. Besides,
the transformation that had taken
place in my whole appearance within
a few months, as well as in my
way of life, had softened his manner
towards me; and the more because
he attributed the merit of it
to himself, and often repeated that,
had it not been for him, my father
would not have had the courage to
persevere in a severity that had had
so salutary a result. He loved me,
however, as I have had occasion in
the course of my life to know; but
as there are people in the world
who are kind, and yet are not sympathetic,
so there are also many
who on certain occasions manifest
some feeling, and yet are not kind.
Mario was of the latter class. At
certain times, on great occasions,
he seemed to have a heart capable
of affection and devotedness; but,
as a general thing, it was rather
evil than good he discovered in
<pb n='462'/><anchor id='Pg462'/>
everything and everybody, without
excepting even those with whom he
was most intimately connected, and
perhaps in them <emph>above all</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Livia alone, after the first few
days, seemed to have a shade of
thoughtfulness and anxiety mingled
with her joy, and Mario, who observed
it, unhesitatingly declared
it was caused by the prospect of
remaining an old maid, doubly vexatious
now her younger sister was
about to ascend before her very
eyes to the pinnacle of rank and
fortune. But I knew Livia better
than he, and, though unable to read
all that was passing in her soul at
that time, I was sure that no comparison
of that kind, or any dissatisfied
consideration of herself,
had ever crossed her mind.
</p>

<p>
But I did not suspect that her
pure, transparent nature, as well as
the instinct of clear-sighted affection,
enabled her to see some
threatening signs in the heavens
above me that seemed to every
one else so brilliant with its sun
and cloudless azure. But the die
was cast, and it would have been
useless to warn as well as dangerous
to disturb me. She therefore
confined herself to reminding me
of all my mother's pious counsels.
She made me promise never to forget
them, and she, too, promised to
pray for me. But when I told her
she must continue to aid me with
her advice, and remain true to her
<foreign rend='italic'>rôle</foreign> of my guardian angel, she
shook her head, and remained
silent.
</p>

<p>
One day, when I spoke in this
way, she replied: <q>Do not be
under any illusion, Ginevra. Marriage
is like death. One may prepare
for it, one may be aided by
the counsels, the prayers, and the
encouragement of friends till the
last moment; but once the line is
crossed, as the soul after death
finds itself alone in the presence
of its God, its heavenly bridegroom,
to be eternally blessed by his love
or cursed by its privation, so the
wife finds herself alone in the
world with her husband. There
is no happiness for her but in their
mutual affection. If this exists,
she possesses the greatest happiness
this world can afford. If deprived
of it, she lacks everything.
The world will be only a void, and
she may still consider herself fortunate,
if this void is filled by sorrow,
and not by sin!...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What you say is frightful.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, it is frightful; therefore
I have never been able to covet
so terrible a bondage. O my
dear Gina! may God watch over
you....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You terrify me, Livia. I assure
you I should never have regarded
marriage under so serious an aspect,
from the way in which people
around us enter into it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Livia blushed, and her eyes, generally
so soft, assumed an expression
of thoughtfulness and severity.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am nearly twenty-six years
old,</q> she said, <q>and am therefore
no longer a girl, as you still are.
But in a few days you will assume
the duties of womanhood. You
will place your hand in Lorenzo's,
and pronounce the most fearful
vow there is in the world. Let me
therefore say one thing to you,
which I am sure is the faithful
echo of your mother's sentiments,
and what she would certainly tell
you likewise. Ginevra, rather than
imitate any of those to whom you
refer, rather than seek away from
your own fireside a happiness similar
to theirs, it would be better for
God to call you to himself this very
hour. Yes,</q> she continued with
unwonted energy, <q>sooner than
<pb n='463'/><anchor id='Pg463'/>
behold this, I would rather&mdash;I who
love you so much&mdash;I would far
rather see those beautiful eyes, now
looking at me with so much surprise,
close this very instant never
to open again!</q>
</p>

<p>
I was, indeed, surprised. For
were not these words, or at least
the idea they conveyed, what I had
found written in the little book
Livia had never read, and was it
not my mother herself who actually
spoke to me now through the voice
of my sister?...
</p>

<head>IX.</head>

<p>
This conversation left a profound
and painful impression on me, but
it was counteracted by the increasing
attachment Lorenzo inspired.
During this phase of my life I only
perceived his charming, noble qualities,
the unusual variety of his
tastes, his mental endowments, and,
above all, his love for me, which it
seemed impossible to return too fully.
It would have required a degree
of penetration not to be expected
of one of my age to lift the
brilliant veil and look beyond.
Therefore the natural liveliness of
my disposition, which had been prematurely
extinguished by successive
trials of too great a severity, gradually
revived. It was no unusual
thing now to hear me laugh and
sing as I used to. The influence
of this new cheerful life counteracted
the effects of the factitious life
I had led the previous year. Under
Lorenzo's protection, and escorted
by Mario, I was allowed to take
long rides on horseback, which restored
freshness to my cheeks, and
inspired that youthful feeling which
may be called the pleasure of living&mdash;a
feeling that till now I had been
a stranger to. My mind was developed
by intercourse with one so superior
to myself, and who endeavored
to interest and instruct me.
In a word, my whole nature developed
and expanded in every way,
and for awhile I believed in the realization
here below of perfectly
unclouded happiness.
</p>

<p>
A sad accident, however, occurred,
which cast a shadow over the
brief duration of those delightful
days. It was now the last day but
one before our marriage, and for the
last time we were to make an excursion
on horseback, which was also
to be an adieu to the mountains,
the sea, and the beautiful shore
that had been familiar to me from
my infancy. For, immediately after,
we were to leave Messina;
and though it was to go to Naples,
I thought more of what I was about
to leave than what I was to find,
and the melancholy of approaching
separation seemed diffused over
all nature around me. Our horses
were waiting at a gate at the end
of the garden, which, on that side,
opened into the country. Mario
and Lorenzo had gone before, and
I was walking slowly along to join
them, holding my skirt up with one
hand, and leaning with the other
on Livia, who was going to see our
cavalcade set off.
</p>

<p>
Mario had already mounted his
horse, but Lorenzo, on foot beside
Prima, my pretty pony, was waiting
to help me mount. He held out
his hand. I placed my foot on it,
and sprang gaily up. As soon as I
was seated, he stepped back to
mount his own horse, while Livia
remained beside me to arrange the
folds of my long habit. Just then
the wind blew off her light straw
hat, to which was attached a long,
blue veil, and both passing suddenly
<pb n='464'/><anchor id='Pg464'/>
across my horse's eyes before I
had fairly gathered up the bridle,
he took fright. I was unable to
check him. He sprang madly
away, bearing me along the narrow
alley leading from the garden to the
highway. I heard the screams of
those who remained motionless behind,
but nothing afterwards except
a hum in my ears. A flash
seemed to pass before my eyes, but
I retained my consciousness. I realized
that I was lost. The alley,
like that in the garden, was bordered
with a thick hedge of box extending
to the road, which was here
at an immense height along a cliff
overlooking the sea and protected
by a low parapet. My ungovernable
horse was evidently about to
leap over it and precipitate me below....
I recommended myself
to God, dropped the bridle, gathered
up the folds of my habit with
both hands, and, murmuring the
words, <hi rend='italic'>Madonna santa, aiutate mi!</hi><note place='foot'>Holy Madonna, assist me.</note>
I allowed myself to fall on the
hedge which bordered the alley. I
might have been killed in this way
no less surely than the other; but
I escaped. The thick, elastic box
yielded to my weight without breaking,
which prevented me from receiving
any harm from the fall. I
remained stunned and motionless,
but did not lose my senses. I know
not how many seconds elapsed before
I heard Lorenzo's voice. I
opened my eyes, and smiled as I
met his gaze. I shall never forget
the passionate expression of love
and joy that flashed from his pale,
terrified face, which was bending
over me! He raised me from the
verdant couch where I lay, and
pressed me in his arms with mute
transport. I, too, was happy. I felt
an infinite joy that I had been saved
and was still alive. I leaned my
head against his shoulder, and closed
my eyes. My hat had been
thrown off, and my hair, completely
loosened, fell almost to the ground.
In this way he carried me back
amid cries of joy from those who
had followed us. Nothing was
heard but exclamations of thanksgiving
to God and the Virgin when,
escorted by a crowd swelled by all
on the road or in the neighboring
fields, who had perceived the accident,
we arrived at the principal
entrance to the house. There they
made me sit down, and in a few
moments I was sufficiently restored
to realize completely all that had
happened.
</p>

<p>
Lorenzo continued to support
me, and poured forth his joy in
tender, incoherent words. My
father embraced me. Ottavia wept,
as she kissed my hands. Mario
himself was affected. In the first
moment of confusion I did not notice
that my sister alone was wanting.
But this absence soon struck me,
and I eagerly asked for her, calling
her by name as I looked around
me. There was a moment's hesitation,
and I saw two of the servants
near me making the odious
sign of which I have already explained
the signification. And&mdash;must
it be said?&mdash;Lorenzo's hand
that held mine contracted also, and
I saw that he, likewise, was so absurd
as to wish to protect me in this
way. I rose.... I no longer felt
the effects of the fall I had just had.
I pushed them all aside, and him
the first. The circle around me
opened, and I saw my sister, pale
and motionless, leaning against one
of the pillars of the vestibule! I
forgot everything that had occurred.
I thought of nothing but her,
and threw myself on her neck.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do not be alarmed, my dear
<pb n='465'/><anchor id='Pg465'/>
Livia,</q> I said loud enough for every
one to hear. <q>I assure you I have
received no injury. I thought you
were more courageous. It does
not seem like you to be so frightened.
The Madonna, you see, has
protected me. I know you said a
fervent <hi rend='italic'>Ave Maria</hi> for me when you
saw me so swiftly carried away, and
your prayer was heard....</q>
</p>

<p>
Livia pressed me in her arms
without speaking, and tears began
to flow from her eyes. Leaning on
her arm, and refusing assistance
from any one else, I started to go
to my chamber. But just as I was
leaving the porch a thought occurred.
</p>

<p>
<q>And my poor Prima,</q> I said.
<q>What has become of her?</q>
</p>

<p>
The reply to this question made
me shudder. The poor animal had
sprung over the parapet, and fallen
down the precipice into the sea!...
Our delightful excursions had
ended in a sinister manner, and
more than one painful feeling mingled
with my joy at having escaped
so great a peril. My heart felt
heavy and oppressed, and my first
act on entering my chamber with
Livia was to fall on my knees before
a statue of the Madonna, which,
in honor of the month of May, was
brilliant with lights and flowers....
Livia knelt beside me, but her
prayer was longer than mine, and I
saw that she continued to weep as
she prayed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, Livia,</q> I said to her at
last, not wishing her to suppose I
thought her sadness could have
any other cause than my accident,
<q>your distress concerning me is
unreasonable. You weep as if I
had been carried by my poor Prima
to the bottom of the sea, instead of
being here alive with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Livia rose, wiped her eyes, and
smiled.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are right, Gina,</q> she said
in a calm tone. <q>I ought to profit
by the few moments we have together,
for we shall not be left alone
long. I have something to tell
you, dear child&mdash;something that
will surprise you, perhaps&mdash;not
about you, but myself.</q>
</p>

<p>
I looked up in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me first put up your long,
thick hair, and take off your habit,
so soiled and torn. Then you shall
sit quietly down there, and I will
tell you what I have to say.</q>
</p>

<p>
I allowed her to do as she wished,
and obeyed her without reply or
question. She appeared thoughtful
and agitated, and I saw there
was something extraordinary on
her mind.
</p>

<p>
When I had, according to her
injunction, taken the only arm-chair
there was in my chamber,
Livia seated herself on a stool near
me.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen to me, Gina,</q> she said.
<q>It will not take long for what I
have to say. Do not interrupt me.
You are really here before me,</q>
continued she, passing her hand
over my hair in a caressing manner,
and looking at me affectionately.
<q>God has protected you, and I
bless him a thousand times for it.
But say if, instead of this, the
horror of seeing you disappear
for ever had been reserved for me
an hour ago&mdash;me who love you
more than my own life&mdash;do you
know to what the witnesses of this
catastrophe would have attributed
it? Do you know what, perhaps,
they think now?...</q>
</p>

<p>
I blushed in spite of myself, but
made a negative sign, as if I did not
comprehend her.
</p>

<p>
<q>You shake your head, but you
know very well what Lorenzo and
Mario would have thought, and
who knows but my father himself,
<pb n='466'/><anchor id='Pg466'/>
and everybody else?... Was I
not beside you this time also? Did
I not bring you ill-luck?... Did
not every one around you just now
have this idea in their minds, and
were they not ready to exclaim,
<q>Jettatrice</q>&mdash;<q><hi rend='italic'>Jettatrice</hi>,</q></q> repeated
she in a stifled voice&mdash;<q>a name
harder to bear than an injury, more
difficult to defy than calumny, it is
really on her to whom it is applied,
and not those she approaches, this
fatal influence falls!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Livia!</q> I exclaimed, turning red
once more, but trying to laugh, <q>is
it really you, my pious, reasonable
sister, who uses such language?
The folly to which you allude has
more than once vexed me to tears,
and I must confess I cannot now
bear that you should seriously
speak to me in such a way.</q>
</p>

<p>
Livia smiled, as she embraced
me, and I saw it pleased her to
hear me reply in this manner.
But she soon resumed more gravely:
</p>

<p>
<q>You know very well, Ginevra,
what I think of this myself. Therefore
for a long time I despised
this folly, and endeavored to overcome
the cruel impression it left
upon me; for,</q> continued she, her
voice trembling with emotion in
spite of herself, <q>it is a peculiarly
hard trial, you may suppose, to
feel your heart full of tenderness,
sympathy, and pity for others, and
yet seemingly to bring them danger
and misfortune.... For instance,
to extend your arms to a child and
see its mother hesitate to allow
you to take it, or even to look at
it. But let us change the subject.
I have never alluded to this trial,
and, if I speak of it now, it is not
to excite your sympathy, but, on
the contrary, to tell you I am no
longer to be pitied. The hour
that has just passed was horrible, it
is true, but it put an end to my
hesitation and doubt. I see my
way clearly now, and peace has returned
to my soul.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her eyes, though still full of
tears, wore an expression of celestial
joy. I looked at her with
astonishment, but did not try to
interrupt her. She continued:
</p>

<p>
<q>Gina, my darling sister, you have
found your sphere, and I have
found mine. May God grant you
all the happiness, yes, all the joy,
to be found in this world! But it
will not equal mine. Pity me no
longer, I repeat. It is to me he
has given the better part.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her voice, her accent, and her
looks expressed more than her
words. I understood her, and was
seized with strange emotion. Yes,
very strange! and a feeling very
different from what might have
been supposed.
</p>

<p>
I loved Livia, and my approaching
separation from her filled me
with so much sorrow as to dim my
happiness. Now I felt that a barrier
even more insurmountable than
distance was to come between us.
It was not, however, affliction on my
part, or pity for her, that I experienced.
It was&mdash;shall I say it?&mdash;an
inexplicable feeling of respect
and <emph>envy</emph>&mdash;a vague, unreasonable
wish to follow her; a mysterious
aspiration for something higher,
nobler, and more perfect than
wealth, position, rank, and the
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>éclat</foreign> so soon to surround me, and
more precious than the love itself
that had fallen to my lot!
</p>

<p>
I remained a long time incapable
of making my sister any reply, my
eyes, like hers, fastened on the far-off
horizon, now tinged with the
softest evening hues.
</p>

<p>
O my God! a ray of the same
light fell on us both at that moment;
but for her it was the pure, calm
<pb n='467'/><anchor id='Pg467'/>
light of the dawn; for me it was
like a flash of lightning which gives
one glimpse of the shore, but does
not diminish the darkness of the
coming night or the danger of the
threatening storm.

<head>Anglican Orders.<note place='foot'><p><hi rend='italic'>The Question of Anglican Orders Discussed.</hi>
By E. E. Estcourt, Canon of S. Chad's Cathedral,
Birmingham. 1873.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend='italic'>On the Decision of the Holy Office on Abyssinian
Orders.</hi> By the Rev. J. Jones. Letter to the
<hi rend='italic'>Month</hi>, November-December, 1873.</p></note> I.</head>

<p>
Canon Estcourt's book is, in all
respects, a most remarkable one, and
can hardly fail to make an era in
the controversy. It is a monument,
not merely of successful research, but
of that intimate acquaintance with a
very complicated and difficult subject
which nothing but the assiduous
labor of years can give. It is
perfectly calm and judicial both in
its tone and in its conclusions; for
learning, like charity, is long-suffering.
It does not contain, we believe all
parties will admit, a single instance
of overstrained or <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ad captandum</foreign> argument,
whilst moving with measured
pace to its unassailable conclusions.
So studiously gentle has
Canon Estcourt been throughout in
his language, and so scrupulous in
his choice of weapons, that we can
hardly wonder if some of his Catholic
readers are startled as though the
trumpet had given an uncertain
sound, and if Anglicans, like the executioner's
victim in the story, hardly
know at first that the fatal blow has
been struck.
</p>

<p>
The scope which Canon Estcourt
proposes to himself (p. 3) is to ascertain
the value of Anglican pretensions
to orders as judged by the
standard of Catholic theology. Anglicans
have professed themselves
anxious that the Holy See should reconsider
their case. They insist that
the practice of ordaining converts
from the Anglican ministry who aspire
to the priesthood is, upon Catholic
principles, inconsistent with
any real knowledge of the history of
Anglican ordinations.
</p>

<p>
Few things, we suppose, would surprise
a Catholic more than to find
that the authorities of the church
had been pursuing a course in regard
to Anglican orders which,
though morally justified by a host
of suspicious circumstances, yet was
not in accordance with the real facts
of the case. Still, such a misfortune,
however improbable, is not inconceivable.
There is nothing incompatible
with the principles of the Catholic
faith in the supposition that
the Holy See may have been practically
misled in a matter of historical
evidence, where such misleading
could involve no misrepresentation of
truth and no fatal mischief. It would
have been otherwise had a formal decision
been given upon any point of
doctrine, as, for instance, the validity
of this or that form; or, again, if the
decision, though merely practical in
its form, yet, like the admission of
Greek orders at Florence, had held
an integral portion of church life dependent
upon its correctness.
</p>

<pb n='468'/><anchor id='Pg468'/>

<p>
We think Canon Estcourt has
proved that Anglican orders, regarded
in the light of the latest research
into their documentary history, are
thoroughly untrustworthy; and that
any reconsideration of their case by
the authorities of the church could
only result in a confirmation of the
ancient practice. He shows, 1st, that
the consecration, under any form, of
Parker's consecrator, Barlow, is doubtful,
and that it is exceedingly doubtful
if the assistance of Bishop Hodgkin
at Parker's consecration would
make up for the inefficiency of the consecrator.
2d. That, although certain
deficiencies in the Anglican form for
the priesthood, upon which various
Catholic controversialists have laid
stress, are not <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>in se</foreign> invalidating, yet
that, regard being had to the genesis
and context of the form, and to the
theology of those who framed and
first used it, it cannot be regarded as
an implicit signification of the Catholic
doctrines of the priesthood
and the sacrifice&mdash;such as a form
consisting of the same words might
be, amongst Greeks or Abyssinians&mdash;but
as an implicit denial of the same.
Thus the Anglican form is substantially
different from any form which
the church has accounted as even
probable, and is quite inappropriate
for conferring the <q><foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>potentiam ordinis</foreign>.</q>
</p>

<p>
Before proceeding to examine
Canon Estcourt's treatment of the
two main points of the question, the
status of Parker's consecrator, and
the value of the Edwardine form, it
will be well to consider an objection
that may be brought against him
from the Catholic side. It may be
urged that, in his anxiety to do justice
to his opponents, he has allowed
them to assume a better position
than they have any right to occupy.
Anglicans owe the assumed assistance
of a duly consecrated bishop at
Parker's consecration, and the assumed
use of a form as Catholic as
the Edwardine, to the assumed correctness
of the Lambeth <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi>.
This document records that on the
17th of December, 1559, Parker was
consecrated at Lambeth, according
to the rite of Edward VI., by Barlow,
Coverdale, Scory, and Hodgkin. Of
these, Coverdale and Scory had been
consecrated by undoubted bishops,
using the Edwardine rite; Hodgkin
by an undoubted bishop, using the
Catholic rite. This <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi> was
first produced by Francis Mason in
1616; and even Canon Estcourt,
whilst granting the truth of its main
statements, denies that it can be accepted
as <q>an authentic and contemporaneous
account of the facts as
they occurred.</q> On the other hand,
there is a time-honored account
which has long passed current
amongst Catholics, and which still
finds able and zealous defenders
amongst their number.<note place='foot'>See the pamphlet, <hi rend='italic'>A Few Remarks on the
Recent Work of Canon Estcourt</hi>, and the letter,
signed <q>English Catholic,</q> to the <hi rend='italic'>Tablet</hi> of May
3, 1873.</note> According
to this account, at a meeting held at
the Nag's Head inn in Chepeside,
Scory alone performed the ceremony
upon Parker and sundry other ordinandi,
by laying the Bible upon their
head or shoulders, and saying, <q>Take
thou authority to preach the word
of God.</q> Here, whatever may be
said of the consecrator, the form is
confessedly insufficient.
</p>

<p>
Canon Estcourt, following Lingard
and Tiernay, simply rejects the
Nag's Head account as controversially
worthless, and accepts that
given by the Lambeth <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi> as
substantially correct. We think that
he is amply justified in so doing.
Of course, however, each account
must stand upon its own basis, and
the rejection of the one does not involve
the admission of the other.

<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>The Nag's Head Story.</head>

<p>
As Canon Estcourt, in his enumeration
of sources of evidence (p. 11),
remarks, <q>A story that has passed
from person to person merely by verbal
tradition, even if names are quoted
as authority, but without written
testimony, cannot be accepted as
evidence, nor allowed to have weight
as an argument, even it considered
probable as an historical fact.</q> Now,
it is notorious that the Nag's Head
story depends merely upon hearsay
testimony, without a particle of documentary
evidence. Whatever vague
rumors may have been current, there
is no proof that the story ever assumed
a <q>questionable shape</q> until
F. Holiwood (Sacrobosco) published
it in 1604. Stapleton, one of our
most learned and vigorous controversialists,
in a work published only
five years after the date assigned to
the Nag's Head consecration, does
not mention it; and, moreover, says
in so many words that the Anglican
bishops were consecrated according
to the rite of Edward VI. Neither
has Saunders a word of it among all
his well-merited vituperation of the
<q>Parliament bishops,</q> in his <hi rend='italic'>Clavis
Davidica</hi>; nor Rischton, the continuator
of his <hi rend='italic'>De Schismate</hi>. These
writers certainly lacked neither information
nor courage. It is true that
when once the Nag's Head story
was brought out, controversialists on
either side were apt to interpret
the expressions of the earlier Catholic
writers as referring to this particular
charge; but when we turn to
them, we find nothing more than the
general charge of invalidity.<note place='foot'>This is true of F. Kellison's <hi rend='italic'>Survey of the
New Religion</hi>, 1603, to whom Canon Estcourt
attributes the first publication of the Nag's
Head story.</note>
</p>

<p>
Dr. Champneys, who wrote in
1616, relates the story upon the authority
of F. Bluett, a prisoner in
Wisbech Castle, who said he had
it from Mr. Neale, the eye-witness.
This last-named person, being at the
time Bishop Bonner's chaplain, was
sent by him, so the story runs, to inhibit
Kitchen of Llandaff from consecrating,
and thus witnessed the
whole irregular proceeding. All the
threads of tradition&mdash;with one exception,
which we shall notice further
on&mdash;appear to centre in F. Bluett.
He told Dr. Champneys; he told, so
says Dr. Champneys, F. Holiwood,
who printed the story, in a condensed
form, in 1604. Dr. Kenrick
thought he had discovered from Pitts<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>De Illust. Angliæ Script.</hi>, p. 770. Paris,
1619.</note>
another mouth-piece of Neale's in
Neale's friend, Mr. Orton; but it is
not so. Pitts, in his biographical notice
of Neale, after stating that various
particulars, which he gives, are
upon the authority of Orton, proceeds
to say of Neale: <q>This was the very
same man who was sent by Bonner,</q>
etc., emphatically marking off the
Nag's Head story as not being one
of the things he had heard from Orton,
though otherwise sufficiently
notorious.
</p>

<p>
Of Bluett nothing is known, except
that he was for a long while prisoner
for the faith, which of course speaks
volumes for his honesty. But a
lengthened imprisonment is not unfavorable
for delusions, especially of
a religious character. When we
come to consider the character of the
reputed first-hand in the line of tradition,
Mr. Thomas Neale, we find
ourselves upon very different ground.
If F. Bluett's lengthy imprisonment
is deservedly reckoned in his favor,
what shall we say of a man who was
able, on the accession of Elizabeth,
after having been Bishop Bonner's
chaplain, to take a public professorship
in Oxford, and who, on his giving
this up, was in a position to build
<pb n='470'/><anchor id='Pg470'/>
himself a house opposite Hertford
College, long known by the name of
Neale's Buildings? These facts, admitted
on all hands, sufficiently bear
out Anthony à Wood's account of
him: that his religion <q>was <emph>more</emph> Catholic
than Protestant,</q> that he
dreaded being called in question <q>for
his <emph>seldom</emph> frequenting the church and
receiving the sacrament.</q> À Wood
is certainly not writing with a controversial
purpose, and this is hardly
the line that a Protestant depreciation
of a hostile witness would take.
The defenders of the Nag's Head
story have had to meet the objection
that Bonner dared not, whilst a prisoner,
have taken the bold step ascribed
to him, by an appeal to his
notorious fearlessness. On the other
hand, every one admits that Neale
was an arrant coward; <q>of a timorous
nature,</q> says à Wood; <q>of a nature
marvellously fearful,</q> says Pitts.
Now, if Bonner showed his courage
by inhibiting, what must have been
the courage of the man who ventured
into the lion's den to execute the inhibition,
and stood doggedly by to
see how far it was obeyed? Surely
we should have reason to be surprised
if, after such an exhibition of courage,
Neale had been afraid to put the
matter on paper, or to breathe a
word of it except to F. Bluett.
</p>

<p>
It has been attempted to establish
the Nag's Head story upon another
line of tradition, independent, not
only of Bluett, but of Neale. Mr.
Ward, in his <hi rend='italic'>Nullity of the Protestant
Clergy</hi>, when mentioning the well-known
examination of the Lambeth
<hi rend='italic'>Register</hi>, in 1614, by certain Catholic
priests then in confinement, at the
request of Archbishop Abbot, continues:
<q>But Mr. Plowden, yet living,
does depose that he had it from F.
Faircloth's own mouth, with whom
he lived many years an intimate
friend, this ensuing answer of F. Faircloth's
to Abbot: My lord, said he,
my father was a Protestant, and kept
a shop in Chepeside, and assured me
that himself was present at Parker's
and the four Protestant bishops' consecration
at the Nag's Head in
Chepeside,</q> etc. This is mere hearsay,
but we confess that we see no
grounds for doubting that F. Faircloth
made just the answer attributed
to him. He was doubtless a firm
believer in the Nag's Head story as
related by Bluett, and his father, who
had been a shopkeeper in Chepeside,
was able to tell him that the Nag's
Head Inn was no myth; nay, that
there had been a meeting of bishops
there; that he, Faircloth senior, had
seen them. Who does not know
how often and how honestly ocular
evidence for an unimportant item is
accepted as evidence of the whole?
If old Faircloth had been able to
give any real confirmation of the
story, surely more would have been
made of him.
</p>

<p>
Even if it be admitted that a consecration
of some sort did take place
at the Nag's Head, there is an important
discrepancy in the versions
given by Holiwood and Champneys
of the Neale and Bluett story, which
is fatal to it as an accurate account
of what took place. Holiwood says
that Scory <q>caused John Jewell to
rise up Bishop of Salisbury, and him
that was Robert Horn before to rise
up Bishop of Winchester, and so
forth with all the rest.</q> If this is to
be taken as an exact account of what
took place, no specific form at all
was used; and F. Fitzsimon follows
to precisely the same effect: <q>Scory
orders them all to kneel down; then,
taking the hand of Parker, says,
<q>Rise, Lord Bishop of Canterbury</q>; in
like manner to Grindal, <q>Rise, Lord
Bishop of London,</q></q> etc. But, according
to Dr. Champneys, <q>Having
the Bible in his hand, they all kneeling
<pb n='471'/><anchor id='Pg471'/>
before him, he laid it upon every
one of their heads or shoulders, saying,
<q>Take thou authority to preach
the word of God sincerely</q></q>&mdash;a
very distinct form indeed, however
invalid.
</p>

<p>
We reject, then, the Nag's Head
story, 1st, as lacking all but hearsay
evidence, and hearsay evidence is at
the command of any cause; 2d, as exhibiting
various notes of intrinsic improbability;
3d, as wholly irrelevant,
in the present aspect of the controversy,
to the question of Anglican
orders. It is irrelevant, because,
whatever was or was not done at the
Nag's Head, it is quite clear that the
parties concerned, the government,
and the bishops were no more satisfied
with it than Catholics would
have been, but continued to move
for Parker's consecration precisely as
if nothing had been done. At the
same time, we protest against the
notion that the Nag's Head story
was a gratuitous lie. For, first, it
is admitted that the bishops did meet
at this identical inn for purposes convivial
or otherwise, and to such
meeting&mdash;viz., the confirmation dinner&mdash;both
Fuller and Heylin, Strype
and Collier, trace the story.<note place='foot'>See Kenrick's <hi rend='italic'>Anglican Ordinations</hi>, p. 81,
and Tiernay's <hi rend='italic'>Dodd</hi>, append. No. xlii.</note> Secondly,
the well-known disbelief in orders
prevailing amongst the Protestant
party; their repeatedly shrinking from
the Catholic challenge to produce
their proofs; their insistence, when
speaking of their episcopacy, that ordination
by a priest was valid, when
taken together, justified Catholics in
the growing suspicion that there was
a terrible flaw somewhere, an irregularity
which even an Elizabethan
conscience stickled at. No one who
reflects upon the genuine horror and
contempt which the sight of the hen-pecked
bishops of England, with
their woman-pope, excited throughout
Christendom, can regard the Nag's
Head story as an extravagant or
gratuitous outcome of Catholic imagination.
</p>

<p>
The principal interest of the fable
lies in the fact that it fairly got
through the Anglican skin, and forced
the production of the Lambeth <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi>.
All the denials of their orders
by controversialists like the
Jesuit Harding, all Saunders's taunts
about petticoat government, affected
them no whit. Orthodoxy and honesty
might go to the winds, but one
virtue they did set store by, and that
was Christian gravity; and this tavern-story
so stung them that they could
keep their counsel no longer.
</p>

<div>
<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>The Lambeth Register.</head>

<p>
We shall now proceed, taking Canon
Estcourt as our guide, to examine,
in chronological order, the various
documents connected with Parker's
consecration.
</p>

<p>
On the 19th of July, 1559, Elizabeth
issued the <hi rend='italic'>congé d'elire</hi> to the Chapter
of Canterbury, that see having
been just seven months vacant after
the death of Cardinal Pole. On the
9th of August the election took place.
September 9, a royal commission
was issued for the confirmation and
consecration of Parker, to whom
letters-patent of the same date were
addressed. The commission was addressed
to Tonstall of Durham,
Bourne of Bath and Wells, Pole of
Peterborough, and Kitchen of Llandaff,
being four out of the five remaining
Catholic bishops, Turberville
of Exeter being the only one
omitted. But joined with the above
four were the returned refugees, Barlow
and Scory. Of the four Catholic
bishops, the first three positively
refused to consecrate, and were shortly
after deprived. Kitchen of Llandaff,
unfaithful though he was, somehow
managed to get out of it; perhaps
<pb n='472'/><anchor id='Pg472'/>
on the score of his weak sight&mdash;the
excuse attributed to him in the
Nag's Head story.
</p>

<p>
Next in order comes a paper yet
remaining in the State Paper Office,
which may be called the programme
of the consecration. Canon Estcourt
gives a fac-simile. It details the various
steps to be taken for the consecration
of Parker, and contains
marginal notes in the handwritings
of Cecil and Parker. Cecil's notes
are significant. Upon the direction
in the text, in accordance with a statute
of Henry VIII., that application
should be made for consecration to
some other archbishop within the
king's dominions, or, in default of him,
to four other bishops, he remarks:
<q>There is no archb. nor iiij bishopps
to be had; wherefore <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>quærendum</foreign>,
etc.</q> Upon the direction that King
Edward's ordinal be used, he remarks:
<q>This booke is not established
by parlement.</q>
</p>

<p>
The second commission, December
6, 1559, was addressed to Kitchen,
Barlow, Scory, Coverdale; Hodgkin,
the Suffragan of Bedford; Salisbury,
Suffragan of Thetford; and Bale,
who had been Bishop of Ossory. It
concludes with the following dispensing
clause: <q>Natheless supplying
by our supreme royal authority
of our proper motion and assured
knowledge, if there be or shall be
aught wanting (in those things which,
according to our aforegiven mandate,
shall be done by you, or any of you,
for performing the aforesaid) of what
is requisite or necessary, whether according
to the statutes of this our
realm or the laws of the church, the
quality of the times and the pressure
of circumstances demanding it.</q>
Canon Estcourt produces a fac-simile,
<q>taken from the original draft extant
in the Public Record Office, with
the autograph signatures of the civilians
giving their opinion that the
commission <q>in the form pennyd</q> may
be lawfully acted on.</q>
</p>

<p>
The Lambeth <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi> testifies
that, in accordance with the commission,
<q>four of those named&mdash;viz., Barlow,
Scory, Coverdale, and Hodgkin&mdash;did,
on the 9th of December,
confirm Parker in Bow Church, the
elect appearing by his proxy, Nicholas
Bullingham; and that, on the 17th,
the same four bishops performed the
ceremony of consecration in accordance,
save in one particular, with the
ritual of Edward VI. We thus summarize
Canon Estcourt's summary of the
reasons for giving credence to the
above facts recorded by the <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi>:
1. The official minute with Cecil's
and Parker's notes. It was never
used in the controversy until referred
to by Lingard. It can be no forgery,
for the forger would not have
been such a fool as to forge Cecil's
remarks as to the illegality of the
proceeding. This document shows
the intention of the parties concerned
to proceed as the <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi> says
they did proceed. 2. The letters-patent
issuing the commission of
December 6, 1559, are enrolled in
Chancery on the patent-rolls, the
highest official test of genuineness.
The original draft of the commission
is still preserved in the State Paper
Office, with Cecil's writing on it, and
the autograph signatures of the civilians.
This paper has never been
produced in the controversy, and no
forger would have taken such useless
trouble. 3. In the recently discovered
diary of Henry Machyn,
a merchant tailor in London, we
find the following entries: The
xxiii day of June [1559] were
elected vi new Byshopes com from
beyond the sea, master Parker Bysshope
of Canturbere, master Gryndalle
Bysshope of London, docthur
Score Bysshope of Harfford, Barlow
[of] Chechastur, doctur Bylle of
<pb n='473'/><anchor id='Pg473'/>
Salysbere, doctor Cokes of Norwyche.</q>
</p>

<p>
... Upper part of page burnt
away.
</p>

<p>
<q>Parker electyd bishope of Canterbere.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The xvii day of Desember was
the new byshope of [Canterbury]
doctur Parker, was mad ther at
Lambeth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The xx day of Desember afornon,
was Sant Thomas evyn, my
lord of Canturbere whent to Bow
Chyrche, and ther wher v nuw byshopes
mad.</q>
</p>

<p>
The genuineness of these entries
is beyond all suspicion. Had they
been made for a controversial purpose,
they would have been used
earlier in the controversy. Although
the diary contains various inaccuracies&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>,
the date assigned to Parker's
election, which is before the real date
of his <foreign rend='italic'>congé d'elire</foreign>, and the loose use
of the term <q>mad,</q> which, in regard
to the bishops at Bow Church,
should stand for confirmation, and in
Parker's case for consecration&mdash;still,
it is evidence that on the date given
in the <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi> something was done
to Parker which could be described
as <q>being made bishop.</q> Bow
Church was the regular place for confirmation,
Lambeth for consecration.
The fact that the five, or rather six,
bishops were consecrated on S.
Thomas's day, on the eve of which
they had been confirmed, although
this last was at Lambeth, and not at
Bow Church, makes the confusion
in their case not unnatural.
</p>

<p>
4. There is a detailed memorandum
of the consecration, in a contemporary
hand, preserved among the
MSS. of Foxe, who died in 1587,
<q>probably nearly of the same age as
the <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi> itself, perhaps even
older</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, older than the <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi>
in the condition in which we now
possess it. This document has been
but recently introduced into the controversy,
and will be again appealed
to when the actual condition of the
<hi rend='italic'>Register</hi> is under consideration.
</p>

<p>
5. Stapleton's assertion that <q>the
Bishoppes were ordered, not according
to the acte 28 (25) H. VIII., but
according to an acte of Edw. VI.,
repealed by Queen Mary, and not
revived in the first year of Q. Eliz.</q>
</p>

<p>
6. Act 8 Eliz., cap. 1, not only
lays down the law for the future, but
enacts that all acts done <q>about a
confirmation or consecration, in virtue
of the queen's letters-patent,
<emph>were</emph> good and perfect; and that all
persons consecrated bishops according
to the order of 5 and 6 Edward
VI. <emph>were</emph> rightly made and consecrated.</q>
This is equivalent to an assertion
that such consecration had actually
taken place.
</p>

<p>
In addition to these proofs, there
are various incidental references to
Parker's consecration on the 17th in
contemporary works and letters,
which have been carefully collected
by Mr. Bailey in his <hi rend='italic'>Defensio</hi>, p.
19.
</p>

<p>
Altogether, there is no gainsaying
the evidence for the substantial correctness
of the Lambeth <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi>.
At the same time, Canon Estcourt
shows, we think, conclusively that
the existing Lambeth MS., as we
have it, is not the original record of
what took place, but rather a glossed
version thereof, in which certain important
and awkward facts are, without
being denied, carefully suppressed.
Besides the Lambeth MS., there
are two others; one in the State Paper
Office, the other in Corpus Christi
College, Cambridge. The former, to
judge by its corrections, would seem
to have been a rough draft, and was
probably submitted to Cecil for approval
before the registration. Canon
Estcourt thinks that the Cambridge
MS. was a transcript from
<pb n='474'/><anchor id='Pg474'/>
that in the State Paper Office, inasmuch
as they agree in giving the form,
<q><hi rend='italic'>Accipe Spiritum Sanctum</hi>,</q> in Latin,
whereas that of Lambeth has it in
English. Because of this and other
variations, neither of these MSS. can
be regarded as a transcript from that
of Lambeth, or as tending to authenticate
its present condition.
</p>

<p>
Canon Estcourt prints the Foxe
MS., of which we have spoken, side
by side with the Lambeth <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi>;
and we see that, whilst in the former
Barlow is distinctly stated to have
been the consecrator, and the rite
used that of Edward VI., the latter
makes no distinction between Barlow
and the other three, and makes no
reference whatever to the ordinal of
Edward VI.
</p>

<p>
Whether the Foxe MS. is a commentary
upon the <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi> or upon
the rough draft, or, as Canon Estcourt
is inclined to think, is taken
from the <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi> as it originally
stood, it is, anyhow, the testimony of
a contemporary ally of the parties
concerned to the existence of important
circumstances which the existing
<hi rend='italic'>Register</hi> carefully suppresses.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult for us&mdash;as, indeed, it
was for Catholics of the generation
immediately succeeding that of Elizabeth's
accession&mdash;to understand the
nervous anxiety that possessed the
Protestant party lest they should give
their enemies the slightest legal pretext
against them. The completeness
of Elizabeth's triumph naturally
tended to obliterate, in the minds of
her victims, the precarious condition
of parties in the beginning of her
reign. There is, however, ample testimony
that this nervousness did exist.
When Horne, the Elizabethan Bishop
of Winchester, tendered Bonner,
a prisoner in the Marshalsea, the oath
of supremacy, the latter demurred, on
the ground that Horne was no bishop
in the eye of the law, forasmuch
as he had been consecrated according
to the ordinal of Edward VI.&mdash;which
had never been legalized after
its proscription, 1 Mary, sess. 2, c. 2&mdash;and
had also contravened the statute
25 Henry VIII., c. 20, requiring as
consecrators either an archbishop
and two bishops or four bishops.
As it was notorious that Horne was
consecrated by Parker and two other
bishops, this last count was understood
as tantamount to saying that
Parker was not legally archbishop,
on the ground that, of the bishops
concerned in that ceremony, three had
been deprived and the fourth deposed.
This bold plea that, to use the
words of one of Cecil's correspondents,
quoted by Canon Estcourt, p.
119, <q>there was never a lawful bishop
in England, so astonished a
great number of the best learned
that yet they knew not what to answer
him; and when it was determined
he should have suffered, he
is remitted to the place from whence
he came, and no more said unto
him.</q>
</p>

<p>
After this we can understand the
persistency with which controversialists
like Jewel, who were in the
secret, shirked the challenge, so frequently
addressed them by Catholics,
to show the steps of their succession.
</p>

<p>
It is highly probable that the Protestant
party, in the anxiety caused
by Bonner's onslaught, so far tampered
with the <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi> as to gloss
over the vulnerable points. It is
noteworthy that this same paper of
Foxe's contains a summary upon
Bonner's case, showing the connection
in the author's mind. It would
be unreasonable to admit the mere
implication of the <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi>, that there
was no distinction of consecrator and
assistants, against the explicit statement
of the Foxe MS.
</p>

<p>
The one point in which Parker's
<pb n='475'/><anchor id='Pg475'/>
consecration, according both to the
Lambeth <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi> and to the Foxe
MS., deflected from the Edwardine
ordinal was this: that whilst the latter
prescribes that the consecrator alone
should hold his hands upon the elect's
head during the prayer of consecration,
all four bishops are said to have
held their hands upon Parker's head.
</p>

<p>
But, as Canon Estcourt observes,
we are not to suppose that, in acting
as they did, Barlow and the others
had devised something new and unknown
before, and which therefore
requires exceptional treatment. On
the contrary, they were following the
rubric of the Exeter Pontifical, which
in this point agrees with the Roman
rite.
</p>

<p>
Supposing, then, Barlow and his
companions to stand in the relation
of consecrator and assistants, would
the incapacity, from want of consecration,
of the consecrator be supplied
by the capacity of an assistant?
Mr. Haddan appeals triumphantly to
Martène's dictum that <q>the bishops
who assist are for certain not merely
witnesses but co-operators.</q><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>De Antiq. Eccles. Rit.</hi>, lib. 1, pt. iii. c. viii.
art. 10, § 16.</note> But
this goes but a little way. It is admitted
on all hands that the assistants
are something more than mere
witnesses, although they emphatically
fulfil that office. They are at least
co-operators by the official signification
of their approval and support.
Those who held up the arms of Moses
did something more than witness
to the marvels wrought by those up-lifted
hands. The comparatively
small number of theologians who
maintain the necessity of three bishops
for a valid consecration are the
only ones who maintain that the assistants
are, properly speaking, consecrators.
Anyhow, the action must be
regarded as taking place <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>per modum
unius</foreign>, for the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>opus</foreign> is one, not manifold;
but once annihilate the principal
consecrator, and the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ratio</foreign> by
which the assistants coalesce <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>in
unum opus</foreign> is gone. If we may be
forgiven a homely phrase in connection
with a solemn subject, Tom is
doing nothing; therefore those who
are merely operative in virtue of their
assistance of him are merely helping
him to do nothing. We do not know
any theologian who has said in so
many words, or whose theory requires,
that the assistant should be held as
compensating for the inefficiency of
the consecrator. Canon Estcourt,
with characteristic moderation, urges
that it is at least probable that no such
compensation could take place, and
therefore, according to Catholic principles,
the safer side would have to be
taken, and the ceremony repeated.
</p>

<p>
It is, then, of vital importance to
the Anglican cause that there should
be no doubt whatever about Barlow's
consecration. Canon Estcourt does
not deny that it is probable he may
have been consecrated. He does
not pretend to do more than show
that there are the gravest reasons for
doubting the fact of his consecration.
We wish to examine fairly the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>momenta</foreign>
on both sides.

<head>Barlow's Status.</head>

<p>
William Barlow had been professed
as an Augustinian Canon of S.
Osith's Priory, in Essex. He had
been early distinguished as the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>protégé</foreign>
and obsequious servant of Anne
Boleyn. <q>In October, 1534, he was
sent as ambassador into Scotland, in
conjunction with Thomas Holcroft,
in order to persuade King James to
renounce the Pope.</q><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Estcourt</hi>, p. 62.</note> In the early
part of the next year, he was again
in Scotland, <q>in company with Lord
William Howard, who conveyed the
garter to King James</q>; and January
<pb n='476'/><anchor id='Pg476'/>
22, 1536, for the third time went to
Scotland, <q>on a joint embassy, again
with Lord William Howard.</q> He
had been elected to the bishopric
of S. Asaph on the 16th, six days
before. He was confirmed by proxy
either on the 22d or the 23d of February.
He remained in Scotland during
February and March, and seems
to have left in the beginning of
April. On the 10th of April, Barlow
was elected Bishop of S. David's,
and on the 21st was confirmed in
person in Bow Church. <q>The archbishop's
certificate of the confirmation
is dated on the same day, but
makes no mention of consecration,
nor is the fact recited, as usual, in the
grant of temporalities which was
issued on the 26th.</q> On the 27th, a
summons to Parliament is sent: <q>Reverendo
in Christo Patri W. Menevensi
Episcopo.</q> On the 1st of May,
he is installed at S. David's, and before
the 13th is writing a joint letter, with
Lord William Howard, from Edinborough,
addressed to the king and
Cromwell, in which he signs himself
Willmŭs Menev, the style of Bishop
of S. David's. He calls himself and
is called Bishop of S. David's on and
after April 25, but not before. On this
account, several of the defenders of
his consecration have plausibly conjectured
that he was consecrated on
April 25, <q>which,</q> Mr. Haddan tells
us, <q>was a Sunday, and when he
was certainly in London.</q> Mr.
Haddan himself, however, prefers to
follow the order of precedence in the
House of Lords and in the Upper
House of Convocation, which places
Barlow <emph>after</emph> the Bishops of Chichester
and Norwich, who were consecrated,
the latter certainly, the former
probably, upon June 11, 1536. He
assigns June 11 as the date of Barlow's
consecration. Lord William
Howard left Edinburgh for England
on or before May 23, and Barlow
writes to Cromwell on that same day
that he <q>has protracted his taryaunce
somewhat after my lord's departure,</q>
<q>for a daye or twayne,</q> at the request
of the Queen of Scots. From this
Mr. Haddan concludes that on June
11, when a consecration was known
to have taken place, he was in London.
Canon Estcourt, however, has
brought to light a warrant of Cromwell's
to the Garter king-at-arms,
who had accompanied the embassy,
and did not return until June 12, on
which day he presented himself to
Cromwell. The warrant is dated
June 12. The king-at-arms would
doubtless have returned, when the
embassy was at an end, with Lord
William Howard, and therefore before
Barlow. But we are not left to
conjecture; the warrant speaks of
Barlow as <q>the bishopp then elect of
S. Asaph, now elect of S. David's.</q>
Therefore, on the 12th, he was still
unconsecrated.
</p>

<p>
Barlow's episcopal register is wanting
both at S. David's, and at Bath
and Wells (to which last he was translated
in 1541); and at S. Asaph's
no register at all exists for the period
when he nominally held the see.<note place='foot'>Note to Haddan's Preface to Bramhall.</note>
The next consecration of which we
have any record&mdash;after the 12th of
June, when we know Barlow was unconsecrated&mdash;took
place on July 2;
but on June 30, Barlow took his seat
in the House of Lords, and from that
time acts and is treated as though
he lacked nothing of the episcopal
status.
</p>

<p>
We are now in a position to collect
and estimate the momenta for
and against Barlow's consecration.
On behalf of his consecration, it is
urged, 1st, that it <q>must be regarded
as certain until it can be disproved</q>;<note place='foot'>Haddan, Pref. to Bramhall.</note>
for no adequate motive can be assigned
for the omission of a ceremony
<pb n='477'/><anchor id='Pg477'/>
which could not be omitted without
incurring severe penalties, to
which the archbishop who neglected
to consecrate would be also subject.
2d. That he was acknowledged, both
by Parliament and by his brother bishops,
to be in all respects a bishop
after June 30, 1530, when he took
his seat in the House of Lords; and
that no syllable was breathed against
his consecration, either by friend or
foe, from that date until Dr. Champneys
first questioned it in 1614, forty-eight
years after his death, and eighty
from the commencement of his episcopate.
3d. The fact that his consecration
is not recorded in the archiepiscopal
register is not much to the purpose,
since out of thirty-six consecrations,
in Cranmer's time eight exclusive of
Barlow's, in his predecessor, Warham's,
time, six out of twenty-six are
not entered.<note place='foot'>See Pref. to Bramhall; but in <hi rend='italic'>Apost. Succession</hi>,
p. 209, Mr. Haddan says nine out of forty-nine.</note> 4th. His episcopal
acts respecting the property of his
sees would have been legally invalid
in default of consecration; but although
these acts were legally disputed,
no one suggested the flaw of non-consecration.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it must be remembered
that the question is really
not whether Barlow's consecration
can be <q>disproved,</q> but whether, in
spite of what may be legitimately
urged in its behalf, there are not
sufficient grounds for suspecting that
it never took place. 1. Neither
Barlow nor Cranmer believed in
consecration. In their answers to
the <q>questions on the sacraments</q>
which were submitted to the king,
they say that, for making a bishop,
<q>election or appointing thereto is
sufficient.</q> Barlow, in a sermon delivered
by him at S. David's, November
12, 1536, is charged with having
said: <q>If the king's gr., being supreme
head of the Church of England,
did chuse, denominate, and elect any
layman, being learned, to be a bishop,
that he so chosen, without mention
being made of any orders, should
be as good a bishop as he is or the
best in England.</q> 2. This doctrine
was undoubtedly favored by the
king; for in another part of this
same paper on the sacraments, where
the bishops are attempting to take a
rather more Catholic line, we have
notes in the king's handwriting to
this effect. The bishops having answered,
<q>Making of bishopes hath
twoo partes, appointment and ordering,</q>
his remark is, <q>Where is this
distinction fonde?</q> and they continuing,
<q>Appoyntament, whiche the
appostels by necessyte made by
common election, and sometimes by
their owne several assignment, could
not then be doon by Christen princes,
bicause at that time they were not;
and nowe at these days appertayneth
to Christen princes and rulers;</q>
the king's note is: <q>Now sins you
confesse that the appostylles did occupate
the won part, whych now
you confesse belongyth to princes,
how can you prove that orderyng is
wonly committed to you bysshopes?</q>
</p>

<p>
3. Canon Estcourt (p. 69) shows
that the other side has no right to
assume that Barlow and Cranmer
would have incurred any penalties
by the <hi rend='italic'>mere pretermission</hi> of consecration;
for the act 25 Henry VIII.,
cap. 20, declares: <q>If any archbishop
shall <emph>refuse</emph> or do not confirm,
invest, and consecrate, he shall incur
a præmunire</q>; and there is no special
mention of the bishop elect among the
persons liable to penalties, the clause
running in general words: if <q>any
person admit or execute any censures,
etc., or other process or act to
the contrary or let of due execution
of the act.</q>
</p>

<p>
The notion that the leases and
other episcopal acts connected with
<pb n='478'/><anchor id='Pg478'/>
diocesan property would not be legally
valid in default of consecration is
a gratuitous assumption. Certainly
neither Mr. Haddan nor Mr. Bailey
has attempted to produce any evidence.
What the law really takes
cognizance of in such questions is
the possession of the temporalities,
an indisputable right to which is
given by the writ of restitution.
</p>

<p>
The recognition of Parliament,
upon which so much stress has been
laid, cannot be regarded as any proof
of consecration, since it naturally and
inevitably ensued upon the issue of
this same writ. This is sufficiently
proved by the fact that Parliament
summoned Barlow to take his seat,
and gave him his full episcopal title,
when, as has been shown above,
he certainly was not consecrated.
Doubtless some of the more zealous
of the Catholic party might have
made a disturbance had they realized
the omission; but, as Canon Estcourt
observes (p. 78), Gardiner was
absent as ambassador in Paris during
the whole of 1536 and 1537.
</p>

<p>
As to Cranmer's register, it is true
that it was very carelessly kept; but
of the nine unrecorded consecrations,
Barlow's would be the only one for
which no collateral evidence whatever
can be furnished. No document
recites it, and every date that
has been as yet conjectured for it has
been exploded. Barlow's contemporary,
Foxe, in his record of the Lambeth
consecration, whilst specifying
accurately the dates of the consecration
of the other bishops engaged, is
only able to say of Barlow that he
was consecrated <q>tempore Henrici
VIII.</q>
</p>

<p>
Canon Estcourt points out that
although there was no regular register
kept at S. David's&mdash;and we know
that the breviaries and martyrologies
which contained records of episcopal
succession were burnt in the next
reign as superstitious&mdash;yet that it is
sufficiently odd that all the chapter
books have been lost, and that the
<hi rend='italic'>Liber Computi</hi>, still extant, has a break
in it for several years before 1539.
</p>

<p>
But this is not all. Canon Estcourt
has found out, on examining the original
document first printed by
Mason as the restitution to Barlow
of the temporalities of S. David's
<q>out of the Rolls Chapel in Chancery,</q>
that the enrolment had really
been made in the office of the exchequer,
as though the matter were
purely secular, instead of on the patent
rolls in chancery. Then, on
examining the original form&mdash;which
Mason reproduced imperfectly, so as
to conceal its real character&mdash;and
comparing it with the normal writ of
restitution, it turns out to be, no writ
of restitution, but <q>a grant of the
custody of temporalities on account
of the vacancy of the see,</q> with the
extraordinary addition of <q>to hold to
him and his assigns during his life.</q>
These grants of the custody of the
temporalities of a diocese which
had accrued during a vacancy were
common enough. The peculiarity
of Barlow's grant is that it is a
grant of custody made to do duty
for a writ of restitution. The grant
of custody was ordinarily made as
a preliminary to the writ of restitution.
No limit was assigned to
it, but it naturally and necessarily
merged in the restitution, of which it
was a gracious foretaste. In the
case of Cranmer, indeed, as Canon
Estcourt points out, the grant of custody
was made after he had received
the restitution of the temporalities
in the usual form; but the grant is
carefully limited to the profits accruing
from the commencement of the
vacancy to the date of restitution.
Barlow's grant is for life, and, by anticipating
in its completeness all that
the writ of restitution could give, it
<pb n='479'/><anchor id='Pg479'/>
would preclude the crown from making
restitution in the proper form
without a surrender of the grant of
custody. Before consecration, a bishop
cannot sue out a writ of restitution,
as the act requires, but the king
sometimes <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ex gratia</foreign> allowed it; the
form, however, of such indulgence is
well known, and is very different from
that of the document in question.<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Estcourt</hi>, p. 76.</note>
</p>

<p>
The form actually chosen <q>may
be supposed to have saved the necessity
of obtaining either the archbishop's
mandate or the archdeacon's
commission</q>; in fact, to have made
Barlow free of his see at once without
any official formalities, and to
<q>secure him in the enjoyment of the
temporalities of the see, whether his
character of bishop was perfected
spiritually or not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The effect of the grant, both in
Barlow's own mind and in official
quarters, may be seen from what followed.
The next day a writ of summons
to the House of Lords was
issued, and Barlow himself immediately
assumed the style and title of
bishop.</q> <q>It seems highly probable
that this special and novel form was
deliberately adopted as suiting the
views of all parties, and being highly
favorable to any ulterior designs
which the king might have upon
the temporalities of the church at
large.</q>
</p>

<p>
It must be remembered, too, that
many of the arguments tending to
show the unlikelihood of the omission,
such as its unprecedented character,
the want of apparent motive,
or, again, the exceedingly imperfect
character of the registration, tend to
diminish the chances of detection.
True, Barlow was not a man inclined
to sacrifice much to his convictions;
but he had a hearty hatred for sacerdotalism,
a strong sense of humor,
and, if we judge from his sermon
quoted above, the impudence, if not
the courage, of his opinions. A competitor
for a tyrant's favor must always
risk something to keep a front
place, and on this point he knew how
the king was minded. Altogether,
he would seem to be by no means an
unlikely man to have played the part
assigned to him.
</p>

<p>
We conceive that these momenta
do amply justify grave suspicions of
Barlow's consecration, and consequently
the repetition of any rites depending
for their validity upon his
consecration.

F. Chevreuse had no time to linger
in the house of mourning; for
it was his duty to inform Mr. Schöninger

But that it was necessary to guard
the unhappy mother from any

even the claims of a supreme

<p>
Until the evening before, the
priest had not permitted himself
even to guess what might be the
contents of the package entrusted
to his charge. Humanly speaking,
he knew nothing. Whatever he
might have learned by virtue of his
sacred office was hidden in the bosom
of God; not even in his most
secret thoughts did he suffer his
mind to dwell upon it. The only
action he had taken in the matter
was such as might have seemed necessary
to one who had no more
than a faint suspicion of what was
about to take place; he had requested
F. O'Donovan to be with

sure that Mrs. Gerald should have
the only preparation possible for
whatever might threaten her, in a
well-made communion.
</p>

<p>
For her sake he had opened the

to be able to put Honora Pembroke

read the confession to her, nor did
he read it himself, but glanced over
the letter which Annette had enclosed
to him.

You must be strong and watchful.
See that nothing disturbs her tonight,

<q>It will kill her!</q> said Honora
when she could speak. <q>It will
kill her!</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse sighed. <q>I think
it will; but there is no help for it.
Justice must be done.</q>
</p>

<p>
It had indeed killed her, and
more quickly, therefore more mercifully,
than they had anticipated.
And now F. Chevreuse, having been
the messenger of disgrace and desolation,
had to be the messenger
of joy.
</p>

<p>
He wiped away resolutely the
tears that started at sight of that
<pb n='481'/><anchor id='Pg481'/>
pitiful victim of maternal love.
<q>To-day, at least,</q> he said, <q>I
must have no feeling. I must do
my duty faithfully, and only my
duty. I cannot allow myself to
sympathize with the slayer and the
slain in the same hour.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was very hard for such a man
not to sympathize with a true joy
or sorrow whenever it came within
his ken&mdash;him to whose lips, even in
moments of care or sadness, the
frank laugh of a child would bring a
smile, and to whose eyes, even in moments
of joy, the sorrow of a stranger
would call the sudden moisture.
But the very excess, and, still more,
the contrast, of these contending
emotions enabled him to hold himself
in a sort of equilibrium. Like
one who walks a rough path carrying
a cup filled to the brim, and
looks not to right nor left, lest he
should lose its contents, so F.
Chevreuse carried his full heart,
and would not yield to any emotion
till his work was done.
</p>

<p>
When he entered the corridor
leading to Mr. Schöninger's cell,
he was somewhat surprised at meeting
Mr. Schöninger's lawyer coming
out. The surprise was mutual, but
they merely saluted each other, and
passed on.
</p>

<p>
<q>He doesn't give up yet,</q> remarked
the turnkey confidentially.
<q>His lawyer comes every little
while, and the warden has given
orders that they shall talk without
a guard. He, the lawyer, is the
only person who can talk alone
with a convict, except the chaplain,
and, of course, you, sir!</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse had self-possession
enough to bow his acknowledgments.
<q>But I wish to enter the
cell this morning,</q> he said; <q>I
don't want to talk through the bars;
and I wish to enter alone.</q>
</p>

<p>
The man looked embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
There was a limit even to the privileges
of F. Chevreuse.
</p>

<p>
<q>You can lock me in with him,
and go away,</q> the priest said, impatient
of delay. <q>I will be responsible
for you this time. I looked
for the warden, but he is not
about the house. Let me go in,
and, as soon as the warden returns,
say I wish to see him.</q>
</p>

<p>
The guard yielded, though unwillingly.
There was something
imperative in the priest's manner
which he did not venture to resist.
Moreover, F. Chevreuse was so well
known as a man who scrupulously
upheld legitimate authority, and
obeyed to the letter the regulations
of any establishment he might enter,
that it was evident there must be
some urgent reason when he would
set a rule aside.
</p>

<p>
The bolts were drawn back, the
door grated on its hinges, and the
priest stepped into the cell. He
scarcely took any notice of the
prisoner, who sat looking at him
something as a newly-caged lion
may look when first his keeper ventures
into the cage, but watched
the guard while he locked the door
again, and listened to the sound of
his retreating steps as they echoed
along the corridor.
</p>

<p>
The prisoner's voice, deep and
harsh, demanded his attention before
he turned to him. <q>May I ask,
sir, the meaning of this intrusion?</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse almost started at
the sound. His mind had been so
occupied by sorrowful and pathetic
images, and he had, moreover,
so associated Mr. Schöninger with
thoughts of joy and freedom, that
the concentrated bitterness of those
tones smote him discordantly. He
had for the time forgotten that the
prisoner could not even suspect
that his visitor was one who brought
good tidings. His surprise was so
<pb n='482'/><anchor id='Pg482'/>
great, therefore, at this repelling
question, that for a moment he looked
at the speaker attentively without
replying, and the look itself
held him yet a moment longer silent.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger had changed terribly.
It was as though you should
take some marble statue of a superb
heathen deity, and carve down
the contours, sharpen the lines
without changing them, carefully,
with mallet and chisel, gnaw away
the flesh from muscle and bone,
and cut in the lines of anger, impatience,
and hatred, and of an
intense and corroding bitterness.
Then, if the statue could be made
hollow, and filled with a fire which
should glow through the thin casing
till it seemed at times on the point
of melting it quite, and bursting out
in a destroying flame, you would
have some semblance of what this
man had become after seven months
of imprisonment.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse was terrified.
<q>Mr. Schöninger!</q> he exclaimed,
<q>I have come to bring you liberty.
Do not look so at me! Try to forgive
the wrong that has been done
you. All shall be righted. The
criminal has confessed, and you are
to go free as soon as the necessary
steps shall be taken.</q>
</p>

<p>
Not a gleam of pleasure softened
the prisoner's face. Only his brows
darkened over the piercing eyes he
fixed on his visitor. <q>So Mr. Benton
has betrayed me!</q> he said in a
low voice that expressed more of
rage and threatening than any outcry
could have done.
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not know anything of your
lawyer, nor have any communication
with him,</q> the priest replied.
<q>I do not know what you mean by
betrayal. I repeat, I have come to
bring you good news. Do not you
understand?</q> He began to fear
that Mr. Schöninger had lost his
reason. <q>Your innocence is established.
You are known, or will
at once be known, to have been
greatly wronged.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is a trick!</q> the prisoner
exclaimed passionately. <q>Benton
has either betrayed me or bungled,
and you think to offer me as a gift&mdash;for
which I am to be grateful, and
merciful too&mdash;what I have won for
myself. I will not take liberty
from your hands!</q> He started
up, and, with a gesture of the hand,
seemed to fling the priest's offer
from him. <q>Do you fancy, sir,
that I have been idle here? Does
a man sleep in hell? Did you fancy
that I was going to wait for justice
to come to me? No! I was
shut into a cage; but I am not the
sort of animal who can be tamed
and made to play tricks for my
keeper. I have been busy while
the world forgot me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I did not forget you,</q> hastily
interposed the priest. <q>And others
also have tried.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tried!</q> echoed the prisoner
scornfully. <q>Sir, when a clay-bank
falls on a poor workman, everybody
runs to the rescue. Not a
minute is lost. People rush in
haste to dig him out before he is
dead. That you call humanity.
You do not even dignify it by the
name of charity. A man would be
a brute to do otherwise than help
in such a case. But here am I,
overwhelmed with a mountain of
wrong and disgrace, shut in a
cage that is changing me into a
madman, and people pause to
consider; they are politic, they are
careful not to soil their fingers or
inconvenience their friends in giving
me liberty. I am a Jew,
and, therefore, out of the pale of
your charity. But, Jew though I
am, priest, I take the side of the
<pb n='483'/><anchor id='Pg483'/>
Christ you pretend to adore against
your accursed and hypocritical
Christians. If your doctrines were
true, still I am a better Christian
than any of those who have believed
me guilty.</q>
</p>

<p>
He seemed to have quite forgotten
the priest's errand, or not to
have understood what it meant.
</p>

<p>
<q>What you say may be all true,</q>
F. Chevreuse replied calmly. <q>But
that can be thought of another
time. You have something more
pleasant to dwell on now. Have
you understood my errand here?</q>
</p>

<p>
In spite of the deep and wearing
excitement under which he labored,
Mr. Schöninger perceived that
his visitor was trying to soothe him,
and was somewhat alarmed at his
violence. He controlled himself,
therefore, and, as much from physical
weakness as from a desire to
appear self-possessed, resumed his
seat, motioning his visitor to another.
</p>

<p>
<q>From the time when Annette
Ferrier came here and begged me
to fly, I have known whose place
I was occupying,</q> he said in measured
tones, his gaze fixed steadily
upon the priest's face. <q>I sent for
my lawyer the next morning, and
put him on the track. I had not
enough proof to prevent the fellow
going away; but his every step has
been followed. I know where he
stopped in London and in Paris;
and a despatch from Rome has
come saying he is there. To-morrow
morning an answer will be sent
to that telegram, ordering his arrest.</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse was confounded.
For a moment he knew not what
to say.
</p>

<p>
<q>I think you will perceive that
I do not need your assistance, sir,</q>
Mr. Schöninger continued haughtily.
<q>The power is in my hands,
and I shall use it as seems to me
best.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And so,</q> said the priest, recovering
his speech, <q>you are willing,
from pride and a desire for revenge,
to stay here weeks, perhaps
months, longer, and await the result
of another trial, rather than
accept the tardy justice which that
unhappy man offers you, not knowing
that you suspected him, and
rather than permit me to be the
medium of his reparation! I can
make great allowances for the effect
which your terrible wrongs
and sufferings must necessarily
have produced on your mind; but
I did not expect to see you show a
needless acrimony. I did not think
that you would wish to strike
down a man, even one who had injured
you, in order to take violently
what he offers you with an open
hand, not knowing, remember, that
you have the power to compel
him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger still looked steadfastly
at his companion, but with a
changed expression. He looked
no longer suspicious, but uncomprehending.
Indeed, his mind
was so preoccupied and excited
that he had only half listened to
the priest's communication, and
the only impression he had received
was that Lawrence Gerald's
friends, knowing his danger, were
trying to temporize, and that, while
securing his escape, they would obtain
the release of his substitute by
some quibble of the law. He was
not sufficiently recollected to perceive,
what he would at any other
time have acknowledged, that F.
Chevreuse was not the man to lend
himself to such a plot in any case,
still less in this.
</p>

<p>
<q>Four weeks ago,</q> the priest
resumed, <q>Lawrence Gerald and
his wife gave me a packet which
<pb n='484'/><anchor id='Pg484'/>
was to be opened and acted on to-day.
They were going away for a
little journey, they said. I did not
know where they were going, and
I do not know, nor wish to know,
where they are. I will not interfere
with the course of the law, nor
shield any offender from justice,
especially at the cost of the innocent.
But since, in this case, I
have been the sufferer by that
crime, I claim the right to forgive,
and to wish, at least, that the
criminal, whoever he may be,
should be left to the stings of his
own conscience. I would have
said the same for you had I ever
believed you guilty. That packet
contains Lawrence Gerald's confession.
Only two persons have
been allowed to know it before you,
besides the two who had to prepare
them for the reception of such
news. The mothers had a right
prior even to yours, and I needed
two assistants. Now, whatever
you may do, my duty is the same.
I have to place that confession in
the hands of the authorities, and
testify that I received it from Lawrence
Gerald and his wife, and that
I signed without reading it. Then
my work will be done. I do not
know much of the technicalities of
the law, nor what delays may be
necessary; but I presume your
further detention will be short and
merely nominal.</q>
</p>

<p>
He paused, but Mr. Schöninger
made no reply: he only sat and
listened, and looked attentively at
the speaker.
</p>

<p>
<q>If I could rejoice at anything,
I should rejoice at your release
from this wretched place, and from
the still more wretched charge that
was laid on you,</q> F. Chevreuse
continued; <q>but I have witnessed
too much sorrow to be able to say
more than God speed you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger did not appear
to have heard the last words. He
stood up and drew in a strong
breath, and shivered all through.
The thought that it was to be for
him no slow fight for liberty, but
that liberty was at the threshold,
had at length entered his mind.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me out of here!</q> he exclaimed,
almost gasping. <q>I cannot
breathe! Open the door. You
cannot hold me any longer. Open
the door, sir!</q> he cried to the
warden, who stood outside, looking
at him in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse began a hasty explanation
to the officer; but the
prisoner seized the bars of the door
in his delirious impatience, and
tried to wring them from their
places.
</p>

<p>
<q>Seven months in a cage!</q> he
exclaimed. <q>I cannot bear it another
hour. Open the door, I say!
Why do you stand there talking?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>With all my heart, Mr. Schöninger!</q>
the warden said. <q>But
you must try to be calm. You
have borne confinement patiently
for seven months; try to bear it a
little longer till the formalities of
the law shall have been complied
with. We cannot dispense with
them. There shall be no delay, I
assure you, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger was too proud to
need a second exhortation to control
himself; was, perhaps, annoyed
that he should have incurred one.
He immediately drew back, and
seated himself. <q>Allow me to
say, sir,</q> he remarked coldly, <q>that
I have not borne imprisonment
patiently. I have merely endured
it because I was obliged to submit
to force. And now will you
please to open the door? I will
not go out till I may; but set the
door wide. Do not keep me any
longer under lock and key.</q>
</p>

<pb n='485'/><anchor id='Pg485'/>

<p>
The warden called to his guard,
who were not far away. Indeed,
several of them, curious to know
what was going on, had gathered
in the corridor, only just out of
sight of those in the cell.
</p>

<p>
<q>Unlock the door of Mr. Schöninger's
cell,</q> he said in a loud
voice. <q>He is no longer a prisoner.</q>
</p>

<p>
The bolts shot back, and the
door clanged open against the stone
casing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me be the first one to congratulate
you, sir,</q> the officer added.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger did not see the
hand offered him, though he replied
to the words. He was looking
past the officer, past the wondering
faces of the guard who peeped in
at the door, and his glance flashed
along the corridor, through which a
ray of sunlight shone from the
guard-room, and fresh breezes
blew. A slight quiver passed
through his frame, and he seemed
to be resisting an impulse to rush
out of the prison.
</p>

<p>
It was only for one instant.
The next, he became aware of the
eyes that curiously observed him,
and, by the exercise of that habit
of self-control which had become
to him a second nature, shut off
from his face every ripple of emotion.
</p>

<p>
<q>I thank you, sir!</q> he said in
answer to the warden's compliments.
<q>And perhaps you will be so good
as to send those men away from
the corridor, and to let Mr. Benton
know that I want to see him here
immediately.</q>
</p>

<p>
The guard disappeared at once,
one of them as messenger to Mr.
Schöninger's lawyer; but the warden
still lingered.
</p>

<p>
<q>You will want to change your
clothes,</q> he said. <q>And after
that, I shall be happy to place a
room in my house at your disposal,
where you may receive your friends
and transact business till the time
comes for you to go free.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger glanced down
with loathing on his prison uniform,
remembering it for the first
time since that day of horror and
despair when he had waked from
a half-swoon to find himself invested
with it and laid on the narrow
bed in his cell.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the officer, too, remembered
that day when he had said
that he would rather resign his office
than receive such a prisoner
into his care, when he had exhausted
arguments and persuasions to
induce him to submit to prison
rules, and how, when at last he
had felt obliged to hint at the employment
of force, he had seen the
strong man fall powerless before
him.
</p>

<p>
<q>These clothes would hardly fit
Mr. Lawrence Gerald,</q> Mr. Schöninger
remarked, smiling scornfully.
<q>But perhaps there will be no
question of his wearing them.</q>
</p>

<p>
The warden uttered an exclamation.
<q>Is it Lawrence Gerald?
It cannot be!</q> He had not been
told the name.
</p>

<p>
<q>And why not, sir?</q> demanded
the Jew haughtily.
</p>

<p>
The officer was silent, disconcerted
by the question, which he
did not attempt to answer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Poor Mrs. Gerald!</q> he said,
looking at F. Chevreuse.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald's fondness for her
son was almost a proverb in Crichton.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mrs. Gerald's troubles are
over,</q> said the priest briefly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger went to the window,
and stood there looking out,
his back to his companions. To
his hidden tumult of passions, his
<pb n='486'/><anchor id='Pg486'/>
fierce, half-formed resolutions, his
swelling pride, his burning anger
and impatience, this news came
with as sudden a check as if he
had seen the cold form of the dead
woman brought into the cell and
laid at his feet.
</p>

<p>
He had been thinking of the
world of men, of the bigoted crowd
which had condemned him unheard,
of the judge who had pronounced
sentence, and the jury
who had found him guilty&mdash;of all
the cold outside world which has to
be conquered by strength, or to be
submitted to; and now rose up before
him another world of pitying
women, whose tenderness reversed
the decisions pronounced by the
intellects of men, or swept over
them with an imperious charity;
who were ever at the side of the
sufferer, even when they knew him
to be the sinner, and whose silent
hearts felt the rebound of every
blow that was struck. He saw the
priest's mother, a sacrifice to the
interests of her son; the criminal's
wife, as he had seen her that night
in his cell, with the only half-veiled
splendor of her silks and jewels
mocking the pallid misery of her
face; and now this last victim,
more pitiful than all! A sighing
wind seemed to sweep around him,
far-reaching and full of mingled
voices, the infinite wail of innocent
and suffering hearts. How gross
and demoniac in comparison were
the bitter, warring voices of hate
and pride and revenge! To his
startled mental vision it was almost
as though there appeared before
him hideous and brutal forms
cowering away from faces full of
a pure and piercing sorrow.
</p>

<p>
He perceived that he had been
taking low ground, and, with a firm
will, caught himself back, setting
his foot on the temptation that had
been making him a companion for
demons. Wronged he had been in
a way that he could not help; but
he could at least prevent their lowering
him in mind. They should
not induce him to yield to passion
or to meanness.
</p>

<p>
He turned proudly toward his
two companions, who still waited
for him to speak. <q>If the arrest
of Lawrence Gerald is not necessary
for my release, then I hope he may
escape,</q> he said. <q>It is bad
enough to be shut up in this way
when one has a clear conscience;
but with such a conscience as he
must have, imprisonment could lead
only to madness or suicide.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Or to penitence,</q> added F.
Chevreuse with emphasis.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger did not reply;
this alternative was beyond his
comprehension. But he glanced
at the priest; and in doing so, his
eyes were attracted to the doorway,
which was quite filled by the ample
figure of Mrs. Ferrier.
</p>

<p>
<q>I couldn't help coming, father,</q>
she said quite humbly. <q>And, besides,
Honora Pembroke said she
thought it right that I should.
I sha'n't stay long or say much.
I only want to say that when Mr.
Schöninger goes out of this place,
my house and all in it are at his disposal.</q>
</p>

<p>
The scene she had witnessed had
quieted her completely, and there
was even a certain dignity in her
submissive air. But when she
turned to Mr. Schöninger, her tears
burst forth again, in spite of her
efforts to restrain them. <q>You'll
have to learn to forgive and forget,</q>
she said in a stifled voice, which
she vainly strove to render calm.
<q>I'm the only one left to make
amends to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger came forward instantly,
and extended his hands to
<pb n='487'/><anchor id='Pg487'/>
her. <q>I have nothing to forgive
in you,</q> he said warmly; <q>and I
would not wish to forget your kindness.
I thank you for your offer, but
I cannot give any answer to it now.
If I decline, it will not be because
I am ungrateful. And now let me
say good-by to you till a more
favorable time.</q>
</p>

<p>
She had had the discretion not
to wait for this intimation, and had
of herself made the motion to go.
</p>

<p>
<q>Try to forgive and forget,</q> she
whispered hoarsely; and, pulling
her veil over her tear-swollen face,
hurried away.
</p>

<p>
This was Mr. Schöninger's first
visitor, but not his last. Before an
hour had passed, the news had
overspread the whole city, producing
a strange revulsion of feeling.
There were, perhaps, those who
were, at heart, sorry to know that
the Jew was innocent. They had
from the first expressed their belief
in his guilt, and they had been
loud in their opinion that he should
be sentenced to the full extent of
the law. This class were not only
disappointed in their prejudices,
but humbled in their own persons.
They could not but feel that they
had rendered themselves at once
odious and ridiculous. But the
majority of the people were disposed
to render full justice. All the
Protestant clergymen called on him,
though but few of them had ever
spoken to him. It was right, they
said, that every man of dignity and
position in the city should pay
some respect to the stranger who
had suffered in their midst such a
cruel injustice, and the fact that
he was a Jew should make them
all the more anxious in doing so;
for the public must see that they
did not persecute any one for his
religious belief. Judges, lawyers,
bankers, professors, men of wealth,
who were nothing but men of
wealth&mdash;all came to express their
regrets and to offer their hospitality.
</p>

<p>
He saw none of them, though he
sent courteous messages to some.
He was too much engaged in business
that day to receive visitors.
Only one received a decided rebuff.
<q>As for the judge who sentenced
me to be hanged,</q> Mr. Schöninger
said, <q>no compliment which he can
pay will ever render his presence
tolerable to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
All the young ladies took their
walk in the direction of the prison
that day, and all the young gentlemen
followed the young ladies;
and, in passing, they lingered and
looked, or cast sidelong glances, at
the windows of the warden's parlor,
where it was understood Mr. Schöninger
was. People who did not like
to be suspected of romance or of
curiosity had some excuse for going
in that direction, and those who
had business in the prison were
esteemed fortunate. Probably one-half
the town took occasion that
day to look at the windows of the
warden's house. But it cannot be
said that they were wiser for having
done so, for not a glimpse did one
of them get of Mr. Schöninger.
</p>

<p>
But when the soft spring evening
deepened, and all the curious crowd
had withdrawn, and the same full
moon which Lawrence Gerald and
his wife had seen the night before,
flooding with its radiance the melancholy
splendors of Rome, was
veiling with a light scarcely less
brilliant the beautiful young city of
Crichton, two men emerged from
the warden's house, and, taking a
quiet by-street, where the trees
made a delicate shadow with their
budding branches, climbed the hill
to South Avenue. They walked
leisurely, and almost in silence,
only exchanging now and then a
<pb n='488'/><anchor id='Pg488'/>
quiet word; but one who watched
closely the taller of the two might
have perceived that his quiet signified
anything but indifference to
the scene around him, and that
he was full of a strong though
controlled excitement. He stepped
as though curbed, and every
moment glanced up at the sky or
at the branches over his head, and
drew in deep breaths of the fresh
spring air. A fine delight ran
bubbling through his veins. All
the feverish mass of humanity, with
its petty hates and still more hateful
loves, its jealousies, its trivial
fears and despicable hopes, was
put aside, and he was entering into
a new and freshly-blooming creation,
where mankind, too, might partake
of the nobility of nature.
</p>

<p>
They passed Mrs. Ferrier's house,
with its broad front and long gardens,
looking very stately in that
softening light, and, after a few minutes,
reached the summit of the hill,
where only a single tree stood guard,
and all about them the world, of
which they seemed to be the centre,
lay spread in tranquil beauty, its
hills and dales, its towns and forests,
bound with a ring of mountains that
showed with a soft richness against
the sky. The city lay white beneath
them, and the Saranac wound like
a silver ribbon across the view.
Where the hills dipped, one sparkling
point, audible with dashing
foam, told where the Cocheco danced
day and night with white and
blithesome feet.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse, standing one silent
moment to contemplate the
scene, was startled to see his companion
break from his side, and,
running to the tree at a little distance,
catch one of its branches,
and swing himself into the air by it.
The priest's first glance was one of
dismay; his second, a smiling one.
He understood the abounding joy
of which the act was an outbreak,
and was pleased with the boyishness
of it, and that the impulse
should have been yielded to in his
presence. Sad as he was, he could
not help feeling glad to see another
possessed by a full and unthinking
happiness.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger laughed, as he returned
to his companion.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't be afraid,</q> he said; <q>I
am not a lunatic. I am free! Do
you know what a delight it is to be in
a place where you can swing your
arms without hitting anything? I
could run here half an hour, and
neither turn nor be obliged to stop;
and I can stand upright without feeling
as though my head were going
to strike.</q> While speaking, he was
continually making slight motions,
as though trying if he had the free
use of his limbs; and when he stopped,
he lifted his head to its full
height, and drew in a long breath.
</p>

<p>
<q>How delicious the air is!</q> he
exclaimed. <q>How fresh and pure!
It comes here from the forests and
the mountains and the sea. There
is no smell of lime or close dampness
or human breaths in it.
Pah! F. Chevreuse, when you
preach again, and tell your people
what they have to be thankful for,
in spite of sorrow and poverty, remind
them of the air they breathe,
the sun that shines on them, the sky
above their heads, and the power
to move about as they will. If this
sky were gray, and pouring down
rain, I should still think it beautiful;
for it is the sky, and not a
stone.</q>
</p>

<p>
He walked away again to a little
distance.
</p>

<p>
<q>Instead of being obliged to give
a reason for being happy, I think
we should be obliged to account
for being unhappy,</q> he said, coming
<pb n='489'/><anchor id='Pg489'/>
back. <q>How many sources of delight
we have which we overlook
because we are accustomed to
them! Mere motion, walking, running,
any natural and unconstrained
motion, is a pleasure; breathing
is a pleasure; the eyes have a
thousand delights. It is a source
of pleasure to exercise one's
strength and overcome obstacles.
I never went up a hill in the country
or climbed any height but I felt
like singing. Swimming, skating,
riding, driving&mdash;how exhilarating
they are! And for all these delights
you do not need the companionship
of man. Yourself and
nature&mdash;these are enough.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I did not know you were so
fond of nature,</q> F. Chevreuse
said, smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not think I ever mentioned
it to any one before,</q> remarked
the other carelessly.
</p>

<p>
The priest was struck by this
reply, and looked with astonishment
on the man who for thirty
years had loved nature, yet never
said a word in praise of it. Could
it be because of a reserved and unsocial
disposition? Or was it that he
had been too much isolated? The
priest was almost afraid to speak,
lest he should check a confidence
at once so charming and so manly.
He quite understood that it was
the unusual and deep agitation of
Mr. Schöninger's mind which had
brought this feeling to light, as the
sea, in its agitation, may toss up a
pearl.
</p>

<p>
He said nothing, therefore, but
waited for his companion to speak
again, not observing him, but looking
up at the illuminated dome
above.
</p>

<p>
<q>When one is free, and has the
use of one's limbs, and is happy,
then one believes in a good God,
who is a father to his creatures,</q>
Mr. Schöninger resumed in a voice
as gentle as he might have used
when a child at his mother's knee.
He had been holding his hat in his
hand; but in speaking, he covered
his head. At the same instant, F.
Chevreuse uncovered his, and the
Jew and the Christian, each after his
manner, acknowledged the presence
of God in that thought, which was
almost like a visible presence.
</p>

<p>
<q>To me,</q> said the priest, <q>the
acknowledgment comes more surely
when I am in trouble. It seems
to me that if I were in chains and
torments, he would be nearer to me
than ever before.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is because you have been
taught to believe in a suffering God,</q>
was the calm reply. <q>I have been
taught to see in God a being infinitely
glorious and strong, a mighty,
shoreless ocean of deep joy. That
he could suffer pain, that his puny
creatures could torment and kill
him, has always been to me a
thought at once absurd and blasphemous.
It is probably for this
reason that you see him best in sorrow,
and I in joy.</q>
</p>

<p>
He stood a little while thinking,
then added quietly, as if speaking
to himself: <q>Yet it is a sweet and
comforting thought.</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse blushed red with a
sudden gladness, but said nothing.
It was no time for controversy; and,
besides, he had the wisdom to leave
souls to God sometimes. That
people are to be converted by a
constant pelting of argument and
attack he did not believe. His experience
had been that converts of
any great worth were not made in
that way, and that the soul that
studied out its own way helped by
God, and teased as little as possible
by man, was by far the most steadfast
in the faith.
</p>

<p>
They went slowly down the hill
<pb n='490'/><anchor id='Pg490'/>
together in the direction of the
priest's house, and stopped a moment
to lean on Mrs. Ferrier's gate
in passing. That lady had just entered
her house, having been all the
day and evening at Mrs. Gerald's.
She would gladly have stayed all
night had Honora allowed it.
</p>

<p>
The two men had, unseen or unrecognized,
been near enough to
hear the long sigh the good creature
gave as she mounted the steps to
her door, and the exclamation she
made to the servant who followed
her: <q>Little did I think last night
at this time what horrible things
were going to happen within twenty-four
hours.</q> Some persons have
that way of dating backward from
startling events, and renewing thus
the vividness of their sensations.
</p>

<p>
She did not know what kind
thoughts were following her in at
the door, or she might have been
comforted.
</p>

<p>
They went on, and soon came in
sight of what had been Mrs. Gerald's
home. The blinds were all
closed, and not a ray of light was
visible. Under the vines and large,
over-hanging trees the cottage appeared
to shrink and hide itself.
</p>

<p>
<q>I would like to go in for
one minute, if you do not object
to waiting,</q> F. Chevreuse said.
<q>That poor girl means to sit up all
night, and she is likely to have no
one else in the room. It is a
gloomy watch, and she may feel
better, if I speak a word to her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Pray do not think of me!</q> Mr.
Schöninger exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse stepped into the
yard, and, as he held the gate open
for his companion, Mr. Schöninger
followed, though with some hesitation.
There were many reasons
why he would not be willing to enter
that house. Indeed, the priest
well knew that it was no time to
take him there openly; but for some
reason he wished him to come near
enough, at least, to feel the sorrow
and desolation which had fallen
upon it. Perhaps he wished to
soften Mr. Schöninger still more
toward the unhappy man the burden
of whose guilt he had borne;
perhaps he wanted to remind him
how entirely that burden had been
removed from him by showing how
cruelly it had fallen elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
The priest tried the door before
ringing, and, finding it not locked,
stepped quietly into the entry,
which was lighted through the open
doors of rooms at either side. In
one of these rooms sat three or
four persons. He said a few words
to them, and closed the door of
their room before going to the
other.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger held back a moment,
but could not resist longer
the temptation to approach. The
outer door was still open, and a
soft light shone over the threshold
of it from the parlor. Drawn step
by step, he went to the threshold,
and stood just where the light and
shadow met, and the door framed
a picture for him. The room
seemed to be nearly all white and
flowers. White draperies covered
the windows, the pictures, and the
cabinets and tables, the coldness
changed to a tender purity by flowers
and green leaves, arranged,
not profusely, but with good taste.
On what appeared to be a sofa
covered with black lay a motionless,
white-draped form lying easily,
as one might sleep; but there
needed not the covered face to
show that it was the sleep of death.
Candles burned at the head of the
sofa, and a <foreign rend='italic'>prie-dieu</foreign> stood before
it. All this Mr. Schöninger took
in at a glance; but his eyes rested
on what was to him the principal
<pb n='491'/><anchor id='Pg491'/>
object in the room&mdash;Honora Pembroke,
sitting near the head of the
sofa, with the light of the candles
shining over her. She looked up,
but did not speak, as F. Chevreuse
came in and knelt at the <foreign rend='italic'>prie-dieu</foreign>.
Her eyes dropped again immediately
to her folded hands, and she
sat there motionless, an image of
calm and silent grief. Her face was
pale and utterly sad and languid
with long weeping, her hands lay
wearily in her lap, and her plain
black dress, and the hair all drawn
back together and fastened with a
comb, showed how distant from
her mind was the thought of personal
adornment. Yet never had
she looked more lovely or shown
how little her beauty depended on
ornament.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger, looking at her
attentively, perceived that her face
was thinner than when he had seen
it last; and though the sight gave
him a certain pain, it gave him,
too, a certain pleasure. He would
have thought her cruel had she
been quite prosperous and happy
while he was in torment.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse rose from his
knees, and Miss Pembroke looked
up and waited for him to speak.
</p>

<p>
<q>Had you not better go to bed,
and leave the others to watch?</q>
he asked. <q>You will be exhausted.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not want to leave her,
father,</q> she replied. <q>If she had
had a long illness, it would have
been different; but it is all so short,
so sudden!</q> She stopped a moment,
for her voice begun to tremble
a little; but resumed: <q>She
has no one left but me, and I want
to stay by her till the last.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You will not be lonely?</q> he
asked, dropping further objections.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! no. The others will sit
all night in there, with the doors
open between. At daybreak Mrs.
Ferrier is coming down, and then
I shall go to rest. I am glad you
came in.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was passing by with Mr.
Schöninger,</q> he said, <q>and I asked
him to wait for me a moment.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her eyes had dropped again
while she spoke, seeming too heavy
to be lifted; but as the priest said
this, she glanced into his face;
then, becoming aware that the
street-door was open, looked toward
it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger stood there motionless.
</p>

<p>
A change passed over her face,
her sadness becoming distress. She
rose from her seat and went to him,
her hands clasped.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mr. Schöninger,</q> she said, <q>she
was the last person who would have
wronged you or any one.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then, seeing that he had not
come as an accuser, she held out
her hands to him.
</p>

<p>
The night before he had been like
one buried alive, and his hand had
been against all the world; to-night
life had crowded back upon
him with its honors, its friendships,
its pathos, and this last scene of
sorrow and tenderness.
</p>

<p>
He bent, and kissed the hands
she gave him, but did not utter a
word, and they parted instantly.
Honora returned to the <foreign rend='italic'>prie-dieu</foreign>,
and, kneeling there, hid her face
and began to weep again, and Mr.
Schöninger went out to the gate
without giving a backward glance.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse joined him immediately.
</p>

<p>
<q>All these wretched doings have
left Miss Pembroke very lonely,</q>
he said. <q>She has really no one
left who is near to her, though she
has a host of friends. But what,
after all, is a host of friends, as the
world calls them, worth? When a
<pb n='492'/><anchor id='Pg492'/>
thunderbolt falls on you, people
always gather round, and a great
deal of kind feeling is struck out;
but, perhaps, you have needed the
kindness a great deal more in the
long, dry days when there was no
thunder. It is the constant, daily,
intimate friendship that gives happiness.
But there! it is of no use
to abuse the world, especially when
one forms a part of it, and is thus
abusing one's self. All of us feel
our hearts warm towards people
who are in great affliction, when we
do not think of them in their ordinary
trials. It is only God who
is constant to all needs, who knows
all. Mr. Schöninger, you are welcome.</q>
</p>

<p>
They had reached the house, and
the priest turned on the threshold
to offer his hand to the man whom
he had so long courted in vain, and
who had so many times refused his
friendship. He knew that he had
conquered when his hospitality was
accepted.
</p>

<p>
He had conquered, in so much
as he had won the Jew's friendship
and confidence; for, having renounced
his distrust, Mr. Schöninger
was, in an undemonstrative way,
generously confiding. Hard to win
by one whose circumstances were
so alien to his own, when won, there
was no reserve.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse's sitting-room was
never a very pleasant one, except
for his presence. It had too many
doors, was too shut in from outside,
and had also the uncomfortable air
of being the first of a <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>suite</foreign>. One
never feels at rest in the first room
of a <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>suite</foreign>. He felt the unpleasantness
of the place, without in the
least knowing the cause of it, and
always took his special visitors into
his mother's room.
</p>

<p>
Mother Chevreuse had, woman-like,
known precisely what her son's
apartment lacked, and had given it
a pleasant look by employing those
little devices which can introduce
a fragment of beauty into the most
desolate place; but her mantle had
not fallen on Jane, the housekeeper,
and thus it chanced that the
priest had, without knowing it, lost
more than his mother.
</p>

<p>
Her sitting-room was cheerfully
lighted when the two entered it,
and the table, prepared for supper,
awaited them. It was the Thursday
before Palm Sunday, and F.
Chevreuse had eaten nothing since
taking a cup of coffee and a crust
of bread in the morning; and now,
the work and excitement of the day
over, and nothing worse than he
had anticipated having happened,
he felt like resting and refreshing
himself. If Mrs. Gerald had been
alive and mourning, he would have
been tormented by the thought of
her; but she was safe in the care
of God, and he left her there in
perfect trust.
</p>

<p>
Andrew, the man-servant, sacristan,
and factotum of the establishment,
was lurking somewhere about
when the priest entered, and came
forward to make a crabbed salutation.
If he ever felt in an amiable
mood or was satisfied with anything,
this man took good care that no
one should know it; and not all the
cheerfulness, patience, and amiability
of F. Chevreuse could for a moment
chase away the cloud that
brooded over his face, or make him
acknowledge that there was anything
but tribulation in his life.
The priest bore more patiently the
constant, petty trial of such a presence
about him because he believed
that sorrow for the death of Mother
Chevreuse had changed the old
man from bad to worse, when the
truth was that the lady had skilfully
hidden much of their servant's
<pb n='493'/><anchor id='Pg493'/>
crabbedness, or had so displayed
the comical phase of it that it had
ceased to be an annoyance, and
was often amusing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell Jane to give us our supper
right away, Andrew,</q> the priest
said. <q>And bring up a bottle of
wine with it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Jane is gone to bed, sir,</q> Andrew
announced, and stood stubbornly
to be questioned, his whole
air saying plainly that all had not
been told.
</p>

<p>
<q>Gone to bed!</q> echoed F. Chevreuse.
<q>What is the matter with
her?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She says she is sick.</q> The
man suffered an acrid smile to
show in the corners of his mouth.
</p>

<p>
<q>Jane sick!</q> said the priest,
much concerned. <q>Is there any
one with her? Has anything been
done for her?</q>
</p>

<p>
In speaking, he took a step toward
the door.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! don't you trouble yourself,
sir,</q> interposed Andrew quickly,
finding that he must deny himself
the pleasure of a long cross-examination.
<q>She says she doesn't
want anything or anybody. She'll
get well when she's ready. She's
got the supper, and I can manage
to bring it up. All the doctors and
all the nurses in the world won't
make her well till she's a mind to be.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, well!</q> said F. Chevreuse,
rather mortified at this exposition
of his domestic trials. <q>Bring up
the supper.</q>
</p>

<p>
Jane had, in fact, one of those
convenient illnesses sometimes indulged
in by some women, and now
and then by men, when they are
seized by a fit of ungovernable ill-humor
which they dare not show
in its true guise, or when they desire
to appear very much abused,
or to escape blame for some ill-doing.
F. Chevreuse had not been
home since early morning, and dinner
had been prepared, had waited,
and been put away&mdash;no small grievance
to even a good-natured housekeeper.
Secondly, about noon,
when all the rest of the city knew
it, Andrew above all, the great
news of the day had burst upon
Jane. It was too much; and when,
toward evening, Andrew had come
home with an order that supper
should be prepared for two that
night, and a little extra preparation
made, and that, moreover, the
priest's visitor would stay all night,
the housekeeper's cup ran over.
News had started from the priest's
house, and made the circuit of the
city, electrifying everybody, and she
had been the last to hear it, and
had heard it at last from Andrew!
She would not have dared to hint
such a thing; but she thought that
F. Chevreuse should have told her
before leaving the house, even if
he had commanded her silence.
It would have saved her the mortification
of being taken entirely by
surprise and displaying such utter
ignorance.
</p>

<p>
While she mused, the fire burned.
She would henceforth bear herself
very stiffly toward F. Chevreuse.
Since he thought that she was not
to be trusted, that she was nothing
but a servant, she would act like a
servant. All those things which
she had done for his comfort without
being asked she would now
wait to be asked to do. He should
see the difference between a housekeeper,
who should, according to
her opinion, be in some sort a friend,
and a mere hired servant. She
would be very dignified, and immensely
respectful and reverential;
would be astonished if he should
ask if anything was the matter;
would do in great and anxious
haste whatever he should command,
<pb n='494'/><anchor id='Pg494'/>
and no more than he commanded;
and she would go to F. O'Donovan
for confession. In short, this woman,
who knew that all the comfort
of the priest's home depended on
her, marked out for herself a line
of conduct which would have made
that home a place of penance to
him, and herself a minister of torment;
while at the same time she
could not only hold herself guiltless
of fault, but even assume an
air of unwonted sanctity.
</p>

<p>
To be frankly and honestly disagreeable
or wicked, one does not
need to study; but a pious hatefulness
requires careful preparation.
</p>

<p>
Her plan of future conduct arranged,
Jane perceived that a notable
pivot was needed where it
should turn from her past behavior;
and what so suitable as a
short illness? Besides, she did not
feel equal to assuming her new <foreign rend='italic'>rôle</foreign>
as yet. The temptation was too
strong to give way to anger. She
bewailed Mrs. Gerald, therefore,
with many tears; Mrs. Gerald's
death, which might have happened
from any other cause, being the
only point in the whole story which
she would recognize or hear anything
about. Weeping brought on
a headache, and the headache
increased. At five o'clock in
the afternoon Jane bound her
head up in a wet linen band, and
began to feel unable to stand or
walk. Duty alone compelled her
to keep about. What would become
of the house, if she were to
give up? What could a poor woman
do who had no home or
friends of her own, and was obliged
to take care of a priest's house?
She must work and watch early
and late, sick or well. Nobody but
herself knew what a trial it was.
And here the victim began to weep
over her own misfortunes.
</p>

<p>
Presently, at six o'clock, Jane
began to feel a pain in her back;
but nothing would induce her to
rest. F. Chevreuse had sent word
that he would have some one to
sup and stay all night, and she
must get the bed-room ready, and
cook something extra. She didn't
see how she could do it, but it must
be done.
</p>

<p>
When her gossips had gone home,
after vainly offering their assistance,
Andrew came in and found the
housekeeper holding on to her head
with one hand, while with the other
she did work which there was not
the least need of doing. He had
been watching with great interest
the progress of her malady, and
perceived that it was near the crisis.
</p>

<p>
The supper-hour had been casually
mentioned in the priest's message
as about seven o'clock. At
half-past six Jane could not suppress
an occasional moan of pain;
and at ten minutes before seven
she consigned the supper, which was
all prepared, to the care of Andrew,
and staggered into her own room,
holding on by chairs and tables as
she went. She would not, perhaps,
have indulged in such violent symptoms
had she seen the smiles with
which her fellow-servant beheld her
tottering progress across the room.
Fully persuaded that she had vanquished
his scepticism, and half convinced
herself that she was suffering
severely, Jane set herself to listen
for the priest's coming.
</p>

<p>
Seven o'clock came, but not F.
Chevreuse; half-past seven, and
still he had not appeared.
</p>

<p>
Jane stole out into the kitchen,
scarcely able to stand, and renewed
the spoiling dishes. She did not
wish to leave anything to be complained
of, meaning to be herself
the only one ill-used. At length
she heard a foot on the door-step,
<pb n='495'/><anchor id='Pg495'/>
and, making haste to shut herself
into her room, with only a very little
opening left, Jane became a prey to
grief and pain.
</p>

<p>
All these movements Andrew had
listened to with great edification;
but what Andrew did not know was
that the invalid, skurrying out to
stand at the foot of the stairs when
she heard talking in the room above,
had had the pleasure of listening to
the whole conversation regarding
her state of health.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes after, F. Chevreuse,
without much surprise, it must be
owned, saw his housekeeper coming
feebly into the room where he sat
at table, her face red and swollen
with laborious weeping, and expressing
chief among its varied emotions
and sentiments a saint-like
and anxious desire and determination
to sacrifice herself to the utmost
rather than omit the smallest
possible duty.
</p>

<p>
It was an unwelcome vision.
There was a point beyond which
even he did not want to have his
sympathies drained. He felt that
he was human, and would like to
rest both mind and body.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am afraid, F. Chevreuse,</q> she
began, in a very sick voice, leaning
against the side of the door&mdash;<q>I
am afraid that your toast is too
dry. I made it fresh three times....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Never mind, Jane,</q> he interrupted,
rather impatiently. <q>It
does very well. You need not
trouble yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
Jane came into the room a few
tottering steps, and rested on the
back of a chair.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know how Andrew
brought things up,</q> she said, very
short of breath, but not so much so
but she could fire this little shot.
<q>I suppose they are all at sixes and
sevens. But I wasn't able to do
any....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If you are not well, you had
better go to bed,</q> said the priest
quite sharply. <q>Andrew will do
all I want done.</q>
</p>

<p>
Taken unawares by this unusual
severity, Jane lost her discretion.
<q>It is my place to look that things
are properly done in the house,
and I shall do it,</q> she said, half
defiant, half hysterical, and took a
step nearer to the table.
</p>

<p>
As she did so, her eyes fell on
the pale and haggard face of their
guest. At that sight she paused,
transfixed with a genuine astonishment,
for she had expected to see
F. O'Donovan; and, after one
wild glance, as if she had seen a
ghost, uttered a cry and covered
her face with her hands.
</p>

<p>
<q>Jane!</q> exclaimed the priest in
a voice that told her he was not to
be tried much further. <q>Have you
lost your senses?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My heart is broken for Mrs.
Gerald!</q> she cried, weeping loudly.
<q>I haven't been able to stand
hardly since I heard about her.
Oh! such a wicked world as this
is. I shall be glad when the Lord
takes me out of it. To think that I
shall never see her again, that....</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse laid down his knife
and fork, which he had made a pretence
of using. <q>You and Mrs.
Gerald were by no means such intimate
friends that her death should
plunge you in this great affliction,</q>
he said. <q>Her nearest friends
bear their sorrow with fortitude.
Your agitation is therefore quite
uncalled for. I have no further
need of you to-night. If you want
anything done for you, Andrew
will go for some of your friends.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was no possibility of resisting
this intimation, and the
housekeeper retired speechless with
rage and mortification.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mr. Schöninger,</q> remarked the
<pb n='496'/><anchor id='Pg496'/>
priest gravely, when they were
alone, <q>women are sometimes very
troublesome.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>F. Chevreuse,</q> returned his
visitor with equal gravity, <q>men
are sometimes very troublesome.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is very true,</q> the priest
made haste to admit. <q>I didn't
mean to say anything against women.</q>
</p>

<p>
And yet, at the woman's first
glance and cry of horror and aversion,
Mr. Schöninger's face had
darkened. <q>Was he always to
have these vulgar animosities intruded
on him?</q> he asked himself.
</p>

<p>
It was one of those annoyances
which a proud and fastidious person
would like to have the power
to banish for ever with a gesture of
the hand or a word.
</p>

<p>
The two friends talked long together
that night, and Mr. Schöninger
told the priest quite freely all
his plans.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall stay here and take up
my life where I left it off, except
that I must now give up all contest
for that disputed inheritance,</q> he
said. <q>All I had has been thrown
away in the struggle. Whether
there would, in any case, have been
a possible success for me I do not
know. It is now too late. This
infernal persecution&mdash;I shall never
call it anything else, sir&mdash;has destroyed
my last chance, and I have
only to dismiss the subject from
my mind as far as possible. I received
to-day a letter signed by all
my former pupils, begging me to
resume my instruction of them.
They expressed themselves very
well, and I shall consent. The
Unitarian minister has invited me
to play the organ in their church,
but I have not decided on that
yet.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I would like to have you play
in my church,</q> the priest said.
<q>Our organist is dead, and the
singing is getting to be miserable.
Our music would, I am sure, be
more pleasing to you; but, if doctrines
make any difference, you
would find yourself more at home
with the Unitarians. I don't see
any difference between them and
the reformed Jews.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Doctrines do not make any
difference, especially as I am not
obliged to listen to them,</q> Mr.
Schöninger replied with a dignity
that verged on coldness. <q>In
music I do not find any doctrines;
and it is not necessary to believe
in order to give the words their
proper expression. Or rather, I
might say that the artist has a poetical
faith, a faith of the imagination,
in all things grand, noble, or
beautiful, and can utter with fervor,
in his art, sentiments which have
no place in his daily life; or, if
they have a place, it is not such as
would be assigned to them by the
theologian. In his mind a pagan
goddess and a Christian priest may
have niches side by side, and it
would be hard to say which he preferred.
Your Raphael painted with
equal delight and success a Madonna
and a Galatea. Your Mozart
wrote Masses and operas, and
vastly preferred to write operas.
He says that he wrote church music
when he could do nothing else.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So much the worse for them!</q>
said F. Chevreuse rather hotly.
<q>Raphael would have painted
better Madonnas&mdash;Madonnas which
would have answered their true
purpose of inspiring holy thoughts&mdash;if
he had devoted his gifts entirely
to God; and Mozart would have
written better Masses, if he had
done the same. When you see a
thorough Christian artist, it will be
one who will never lower himself
to a subject contrary to, or disconnected
<pb n='497'/><anchor id='Pg497'/>
with, religion. The others
have been false, and consequently
have had only glimpses where they
might have had visions. Some of
them were great, but they might
have been immeasurably greater.
No, I repeat, do not imagine that
you are going to feel or play our
music as you might if you were a
good Catholic. But excuse me!</q>
he said, recalling himself. <q>I have
given you rather more of a lecture
than I meant to. I still want you
to take our music in hand, if you
will.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will with pleasure, if you will
be content with my interpretation
of it,</q> Mr. Schöninger said with a
smile.
</p>

<p>
He was not in the least displeased
with the priest's lecture, and,
on the contrary, decidedly liked it.
He was stirred by anything which
consecrated art as an embodiment
of the divine rather than a mere expression
of the human.
</p>

<p>
Surprise is but a short-lived
emotion; and when Mr. Schöninger
was left alone that night, with
the first opportunity in many
months of thinking in an unobserved
solitude, he wondered more at
his own calmness than at anything
which had happened to him. The
hideous suffering from which he
had but just escaped looked far
away, and so alien that he could
contemplate it almost with a cold
inquisitiveness, as something in
which he had no part. It was
scarcely more to him than the
delirious dreams of a fever which
had passed away. Indignation
and a desire to revenge himself
might rise again, would rise again;
but for the present they slept. The
first joy of freedom, too, was over.
Nothing remained but a feeling of
quiet and security. Doubtless he
had, without knowing it, been
soothed by the many kind and regretful
words that had been addressed
to him that day, and felt less
disposed to dwell on his own
wrongs when he knew that so many
others were thinking and speaking
of them.
</p>

<p>
All round the room assigned to
him hung the pictures that had
belonged to Mother Chevreuse&mdash;an
old-fashioned portrait of her husband
in the uniform of a French
officer, a S. Ignatius of Loyola, a S.
Antony preaching to the fishes, a
print, on a gold ground, of the
miraculous Lady of Perpetual Succor,
and a Santa Prassede sleeping
on her slab of granite.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger held his candle
up to examine each of these, all
but the portrait familiar to him in
their originals; and as he looked, the
places where he had first seen them,
the stately palaces and the quiet
churches, enclosed his imagination
within their walls. He saw again
the lines of sombre columns leading
up to the glowing mosaics of
the tribune, where the vision of S.
John hung petrified in air; the dim
lamp in the mysterious chapel of
the <hi rend='italic'>Colonna Santa</hi> shone out again
inside its grating, and the walls
glittered dimly back. He saw the
thickets of camellias mantled with
bloom under an April sky, a little
forest of white at the right hand,
and a forest of rose-red at the left,
and ever the fountains sparkling
through.
</p>

<p>
How strange it was! He set
down his candle, almost impatiently,
as if a beautiful vision were
being melted in the light of it,
and blew it out. How strange it
was! When he was in Rome, he
had hated it while he admired it; but
now, as the thought of it came up,
his heart yearned out towards it,
and grew tender and full with longing
<pb n='498'/><anchor id='Pg498'/>
for it. How strange that his
dearest affections should cluster
where his deepest hates had pierced,
and that, whenever an accusing
thought arose, an excusing one
immediately answered it. The city
of the Ghetto was becoming to him
also the city of the silvery-haired
old man who had opened its gates.
To remember him was like remembering
a pure white star that
had shone out one still evening
long ago.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger put aside the
curtain that hardly barred the full
moonlight from the room, and leaned
out into the night. Not many
streets distant Honora Pembroke
sat wakeful and mourning, alone
with her dead. By what fatality
was it that the silent woman lying
there, and the weeping one beside
her, should have the power to stand,
with their softness and their pallor,
between him and his remembrance
of that gloomy mansion of hate and
crime, the shadow of whose portal
had but just slipped from him?
The cold and trembling hands he
had kissed that night had quenched
for a time all anger in his heart.
</p>

<p>
He sighed, thinking of that sad
household, and his gaze turned tenderly
and steadily in its direction.
He would have liked to call down a
blessing on the head he loved had it
not been so much nearer the source
of all blessing than he was. She
was right, no matter what she believed.
All she held good was
good, at least as far as she was concerned,
and no blame of false doctrine
could be imputed to her.
</p>

<p>
A ray of light stronger than that
of the moon shining across his eyes
attracted his attention. It came
from F. Chevreuse's sitting-room,
the one window of which was at
right angles with the window where
he leaned. A small, displaced fold
of the curtain showed him the
priest on his knees there before a
crucifix, his hands clasped, his
black-robed form as motionless as
if it had been carved out of ebony.
Here, too! Could he have no other
friend than a Christian priest for his
hand and heart to cling to?
</p>

<p>
Yet all was sweet and peaceful,
and everything conspired to soothe
him. The air touched him with a
breath too soft to be called a breeze,
the city was still about him, and
only a foamy murmur told where
the sleepless river flowed.
</p>

<p>
Triumph, joy, and sweetness he
had felt, and at last came gratitude
to God and forgiveness of man.
One of his last thoughts that night
was of pity for Lawrence Gerald.
</p>

<p>
In that pity he was not alone;
for nearly the whole of Crichton
shared it. They had known the
young man from his childhood, had
blamed and petted him, had put
every temptation in his way, and
been ready to defend him when he
yielded. In spite of his haughtiness
and assumption, there was not
a single person in the city, perhaps,
who really disliked him. His captivating
beauty and wayward sweetness
won more affection than the
highest virtues or the noblest gifts
of mind would have won. When a
stranger and a Jew was accused,
they could believe him to have been
actuated by the most cruel malignity;
but it was impossible to impute
such feelings to Lawrence Gerald.
He was weak and imprudent, and
had become involved, and so led
on beyond his intention. Each one
could imagine, even before the confession
was made public, just how
it had happened; and when they
read the confession, the feeling was
almost universal in favor of his escape.
Only a few, sternly just, insisted
on hoping that he would be
<pb n='499'/><anchor id='Pg499'/>
brought to suffer the full penalty
of the law. Fathers and mothers
whose boys, scarcely more governable
than he, had played and grown
up with him, looked with terror on
their own children; and young men
who secretly knew themselves to
have been preserved only by what
they would have called chance from
crimes as bad as his, shuddered at
the thought of his being brought
back among them to be tried for
his life. A sort of panic seized upon
all when they saw what horrors
could grow out of that which had
seemed to be mere youthful errors,
and how criminal had been the
leniency of public opinion and of
the law. Mr. Schöninger's case
had held no moral for them, for he
was an alien; but what Lawrence
Gerald was some of their own
might be. They were conspicuously
generous, these people, in that
charity which stays at home and
makes excuses for its own little
circle; and for this time, at least,
they regretted that their charity
had not gone beyond that boundary,
and extended to the stranger within
their gates.
</p>

<p>
<q>I confess before Almighty God,
to the man who has been so wronged
on my account, and to my
friends and neighbors, whom I have
deceived</q>&mdash;so Lawrence Gerald's
confession began&mdash;<q rend='pre'>that I am guilty
in deed, though not in intention,
of the death of Madame Chevreuse,
for which Mr. Schöninger is now
unjustly condemned. I had gambled,
and was in debt to a man who
threatened to expose me if I did
not pay him at once. I knew that
the exposure would ruin me. I
should have lost my situation, my
marriage would have been prevented,
and my mother's heart would
have been broken. The debt was
not a new one. I had not gambled
for a good while, and had resolved
never to do so again; and I have
kept that resolution. If I would have
broken it, and increased my debt,
the man would have waited. I was
tempted to, but I resisted. It seemed
to me better to take the money&mdash;I
did not call it stealing&mdash;when I
could get it, and repay it privately
after my marriage. I knew that I
could have it then, a little at a
time. I had known many men to
be excused for such things&mdash;men
who had used money that belonged
to others, meaning to repay it some
time, and the law had not punished
them severely. Yet there was not
a case where the need seemed to
be as great as mine. I thought of
it a long time before I felt as if I
could do it, and then I didn't resolve
that I would. I only felt that
I would take advantage of whatever
chance occurred. I never arranged
anything. F. Chevreuse dropped
his latch-key into the furnace register
one day when he was at my
mother's. I got it out afterward,
and kept it. I knew already that
the key of our street-door would
unlock his. Those two helps I regarded
as an intimation of what I
was to do. I even thought them
providential; and I promised God
that if I should succeed in getting
the money and paying my debts, I
would lead a good life in future. I
didn't know that I was blaspheming.
Afterward I heard F. Chevreuse
say just how much money he
had, and where he kept it. He
was talking to my mother and me.
I took that as another intimation.
I said, Such a good man as he
would not be permitted to help me
along in this way, if I were not to
do what I am thinking of. Then
I knew that for one night he would
be away; but still I did not resolve.
I only followed wherever circumstances
<pb n='500'/><anchor id='Pg500'/>
led me; and every circumstance
led me straight on to crime.
We were at Mrs. Ferrier's that evening
singing, and the night was
dark. If it had been a bright night,
I should not have ventured to go
to the priest's door. I said to myself
that it was perhaps God who
had made the night dark for me.
I went home from Mrs. Ferrier's,
and went to my own room, taking
the key of the street-door with me.
I stayed there till all were asleep;
and I thought that if my mother
had left her chamber-door open, I
would not go out, for she might hear
me going down-stairs. She usually
left it open, but that night it was
shut. I went down the back stairs,
and got out of a little window at
the back of the house; and even
then I did not say surely to myself
what I was going to do.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>It was necessary that I should
have some disguise, and I had
none; but I had seen Mr. Schöninger
lay his shawl down in Mrs.
Ferrier's garden, and I thought he
had left it there. I took that for
another sign. If the shawl were
not there, I would go home again.
It was there, and I wrapped myself
in it, and walked toward the priest's
house, ready to turn back at the
least obstacle. The only person
I saw was a policeman, and he was
behind me, so that I was forced
to go forward. A thunder-shower
was coming up, and the sound of it
deadened my steps. When I reached
the door, I stopped again, and,
for the first time, made a plan. If
any one should find me unlocking
it, I would say that my mother was
sick, and I had come for Mother
Chevreuse. If Andrew or Jane
should meet and know me as I entered,
I would tell the same story,
and would ask for Mother Chevreuse,
and then confess the whole
truth to her. I knew she would
pity, and perhaps she would help,
me. If Mother Chevreuse herself
should come upon me, and recognize
me, I would confess to her, and
beg her mercy. Nobody saw or
heard me till I had got the money
into my hands, and was going away;
and then it was too late to confess.
All my irresolution had gone away,
and I was desperate. It was no
longer a question of confessing to
one person, but of being exposed
before three, and, of course, before
the world. All the excuses I had
made for myself before became as
nothing, and I knew that I was a
thief. The money was in my hands,
I had earned it, and I meant to
keep it. The rest is all like a flash
of lightning. Why did she cling so
to me? I told her twice to let
go, or I might hurt her. My blood
was all in my head. If those two
servants had come and seen me
there, I should have killed myself
before their faces. I heard their
steps coming, and I pushed her
with all my strength. I did not stop
to think where we were. She let
go then; but I have felt her soft
hands clinging to me ever since.
It maddens a man to have a woman's
soft hands clinging to him
when he wants to get away. After
that, I ran back to Mrs. Ferrier's
garden, and left the shawl, and then
I went home.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>When I was sick, and thought
I was going to die, and couldn't
get another priest, I confessed to F.
Chevreuse, and he forgave me; but
he told me that I must consent to
his telling all in order to clear Mr.
Schöninger as soon as I should be
dead. I consented; but I did not
die, and so he could do nothing.
I hereby give him leave to tell all
that I then told him. I have not
been to confession since, because I
<pb n='501'/><anchor id='Pg501'/>
didn't want to give him a chance to
say anything to me. I forgot then
to tell him that I had the money
still, but I shall give it back with
this. Of course I did not dare to
use it. I told the man I owed to
do his worst about it, and he did
nothing, only said he would wait
till I could pay him. I found I had
gained nothing, and lost all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My wife found me out, I do
not know how, and I never asked;
and it is she who writes this from
my dictation. John, my mother's
footman, found me out, and I have
never asked him how. He will
sign this, but without reading it.
I think he has no proof against me.
F. Chevreuse knows nothing except
what he has learned in the
confessional. This will be left with
him, to be opened four weeks from
to-day. With him, also, I leave a
letter to my dearest mother, whom
I am not worthy to name, and a
letter for Mr. Schöninger.</q>
</p>

<p>
The letter to his mother was buried
with her. No one ever read
it, unless those dead eyes could
see. The letter to Mr. Schöninger
was simply to beg the forgiveness
which, the writer added, he scarcely
hoped to receive.
</p>

<p>
The confession was written in a
clear, even hand, with evident deliberation
and painstaking on the
part of the amanuensis; and if the
writer's heart had trembled, not a
line showed it. Only here and
there a large blister on the paper
showed where a tear had fallen.
</p>

<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Grundy were
shocked at the writer's insensibility;
but then Annette Ferrier always
was queer, they added.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps only one of the many
who read that confession was aware
of the sting it contained for F.
Chevreuse, or dreamed that those
<q>soft, clinging hands</q> would be felt
by him also, as well as by the
criminal, for many a day. Mr.
Schöninger shrank with a pang of
sympathetic pain when he saw the
words, and almost wondered that
Annette Gerald could, even in that
moment of supreme misery, have
been unaware of their cruelty.
</p>

<p>
<q>I own to you,</q> F. Chevreuse
confessed years afterward to F.
O'Donovan, <q>that when I first read
those words, I realized for one moment
how a man might be willing
to kill another. The image of him
flinging off my mother's clinging
hands&mdash;well, well! The time will
never come when I can speak
calmly of it. Fortunately for me
then, it was Holy Week, and I had
my crucified Lord before me, and
plenty of work on my hands. Mr.
Schöninger helped me, too. I knew
what he meant, though he made no
explanation. He only said, <q>Your
Christ is strong, if he can keep
your hand from clinching.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
Christ was strong, and the Jew
was yet to feel his might.
</p>

<p>
Just at present, however, he had
earthly things to think of, and a
trial to endure particularly disagreeable
to one of his temperament.
He had to be a second
time the lion of the hour, to be
stared at, followed, observed in all
he did, listened to in all he said&mdash;in
short, to be the temporary victim
of public curiosity.
</p>

<p>
Conquering his disgust and annoyance,
he chose the best method
of making this trial a short one, by
showing himself quite freely. He
took rooms at a quiet hotel frequented
by business men, and very
seldom visited by ladies. If the
mood should take him to pace his
room at night, he did not choose
that any sympathizing heart should
be counting his footsteps. He
called on his former pupils, and
<pb n='502'/><anchor id='Pg502'/>
made appointments with them, and
listened with patience to their earnest,
and often tearful, protestations
of regret and indignation in his regard.
He gathered up into his
hands, one by one, the threads
of ordinary life, and tried to interest
himself in them again, and to
renew some of his old pleasures;
but he could not unite them and
weave his heart in with them as before.
A gulf, of which he only
now became aware, lay between
him and the past. It was not the
sense of wrong and loss, it was not
even that he had a greater distrust
of mankind; it was at once higher
and deeper than anything merely
personal: it was a disgust and fear
of life itself, as he had seen and
felt it, a sense of instability and
of hollowness everywhere. His desires
for wealth and power and
fame dropped into an abyss, and
left no sound to tell that they were
substances or had encountered any
substance in their descent. Like
one who, walking over a bridge,
suddenly perceives that, instead of
solid arches of stone beneath, there
is only a thin and trembling framework
between him and the torrent,
he felt that he might at any moment
fall through into the unknown
world, or into nothingness.
</p>

<p>
This man had called himself a
Jew, partly from an inherited allegiance,
which ran in his blood,
though it was no longer niched in
his brain, partly, also, from a generous
unwillingness to desert the unfortunate.
He cherished the fragments
of his ancient traditions as
the poet and the antiquary cherish
the ruins of an antique temple, in
which the vulgar see only broken
rocks and rubbish, but from which
their imaginations can rebuild portico
and sculptured frieze and
painted ceiling. Their eyes can
discern the acanthus leaf where it
lies half choked in dust, and the
dying glimmer of what once was
gold, and, faintly burning through
its encrusting soil, the imperishable
color of that rare stone, blue as the
vault of a midnight sky. In the
ruin of his people Mr. Schöninger
still beheld and gloried in that sublime
race which, in the early world,
had borne the day-star on their
foreheads.
</p>

<p>
But it was only a memory to him,
and the present was all vanity.
</p>

<p>
While in prison, he had thought
that liberty was, of all things, the
most precious. In his emptied heart
it had been the one object of longing;
and in the first moments of
freedom he had found it intoxicating.
But the joy it gave effervesced
and died away like foam, and the
emptiness remained. Looking back
on that prison life, he almost wondered
at the agony it had caused
him, or even that the shameful
death which had threatened him
should have had power to move him
so, or that the opinions and the enmities
of men should have struck such
bitterness from his soul. What was
it all but motes in the beam? <q>Vanity
of vanities, and all is vanity.</q>
</p>

<p>
But life must be lived, and work
must be done; and he took up the
duties that came to hand, and performed
them almost as if he loved
them.
</p>

<p>
One small pleasure, indeed, he
gave himself. Escaping from the
city, with as much care as if he had
been flying from justice, he took
a long, solitary walk in the pine-woods
where, nearly a year before,
he had gone with a May party, and,
searching there, he brought back
handfuls of pale, nodding snow-drops,
and sent them by a trusty
messenger to Honora Pembroke.
</p>

<p>
<q>They are for her or for Mrs.
<pb n='503'/><anchor id='Pg503'/>
Gerald, as she may choose,</q> he
said.
</p>

<p>
She made no answer, but the messenger
saw her lay the delicate
blossoms in the white hand of the
dead, while her tears fell on them,
drop by drop.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger's generosity of
feeling would have prompted him
to attend the funeral, but his good
taste prevented. He would have
been too much observed there. He
watched the procession as it passed
by his window&mdash;an old-fashioned,
solemn, genuine New-England funeral;
no mourning carriages with
laughing people inside, no hired
bearers but a long line of friends
and neighbors, who knew and lamented
the dead, walking after her
with downcast faces, to stand by
her grave till the earth should have
covered her in.
</p>

<p>
In a town like Crichton such a
death for such a cause would create
a deep impression; and crowds
stood all about the cottage when
the friends who were admitted
came out from its doors, and a
grave silence prevailed in all the
streets as they passed through
them.
</p>

<p>
It was Good Friday; and that
evening, for the first time, the new
organist was to take charge of the
choir in the Immaculate Conception.
There was but little to do,
for the singers were not in training&mdash;only
a hymn or two to sing before
the sermon, and nothing after.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger was glad that he
should thus be able to leave the
church before the sermon without
seeming disrespectful to F. Chevreuse,
as he would have seemed in
going out and coming in again
when the sermon was over. He
had not the least objection to
hearing Catholic sermons, provided
they did not bore him&mdash;had, indeed,
heard many of them; but he did
not wish to hear F. Chevreuse
speak on the passion and death of
Christ. To him, that had always
been the weakest point in the
Christian theology. He could reverence
almost to the verge of
adoration the sublime humility
and sweetness and patience of that
life which they called divine; but
he shrank from the agony which
crowned it as something weak and
unfitting. A life so perfect ending
thus was to him incongruous; as
though the eye, travelling up a lofty
and exquisite column, should see a
rude block at the top instead of a
perfect capital.
</p>

<p>
<q>If it does not prove the falsehood
of the whole,</q> Mr. Schöninger
said to himself, <q>it proves a great
mistake somewhere; and I would
rather not hear such a man as F.
Chevreuse try to make it seem reasonable.</q>
</p>

<p>
But he would not be in too great
a hurry to go. He lingered a
little, arranged the music, and
stopped at the door of the choir
long enough to hear the priest
announce his text: <hi rend='italic'>The Lord hath
laid upon him the iniquities of us all</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<q>My Isaiah!</q> he thought. <q>I
wonder what he meant in writing
that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Good Friday is, to my mind,
not so much a day of sorrow as a
day of remorse,</q> the priest began.
<q>The Jews were ungrateful, and we
are ungrateful.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That dear, just soul!</q> Mr.
Schöninger muttered with a smile,
as he went slowly out.
</p>

<p>
Going down the stairs, he caught
now and then a sentence. <q>We
sin, and are forgiven, and then we
sin again; and we sin against a God
whom we acknowledge; they sinned
against a God in whom they
did not believe.</q>
</p>

<pb n='504'/><anchor id='Pg504'/>

<p>
And again: <q>Peter sinned once,
but he never denied his Master a
second time; Magdalene was once
a sinner, but never again.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger stopped at a
narrow pointed window near the
foot of the stairs, and looked out
into the night. He had half a mind
to go back and listen to the sermon.
There was something enchaining
in the way F. Chevreuse preached.
His were no cut-and-dried orations
where the form is first laid out, and
each part fitted in as exact as a
mosaic, and where no fault can be
found, except that there is such an
absence of faults. He poured his
heart out; he announced a truth,
and then, in a few sentences, he
threw a picture before their eyes to
illustrate it; he walked the platform
where he stood, and seemed at
times so transported by his feelings
as to forget that he was not talking
to himself alone.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger paused in the
lower door, and listened again,
hating to stay, hating still more to
go away, so empty did his soul
feel.
</p>

<p>
The speaker gave a brief backward
glance over what he had
already said. They had seen the
agony in the garden, and now they
were going to see what it meant.
They had seen the cup put aside
by the hand of Christ, and now
they were going to see him drink
it to the dregs. They had seen
him bear uncomplainingly the
stripes and the thorns, now they
were going to hear him cry out in
the agony of desolation.
</p>

<p>
With a rapid touch he sketched
the scene&mdash;the surging, angry crowd,
driving and hurrying forward a man
in the midst, who drags and stumbles
under a heavy cross.
</p>

<p>
The priest wrung his hands slowly,
walking to and fro, with that
sight before him. <q>O my God!</q>
he said, half to himself, <q>is it thus
that I see thee? Thy divinity is
reduced so small&mdash;so small that it
requires all the fulness of my faith
to discern it. This man is covered
with dust and blood. He hath fallen
beneath his load, and the dust
of the street is on him, on his hands,
and even his face, with the blood
and the sweat. They buffet him,
they laugh at him</q>&mdash;the speaker
faced his congregation suddenly,
stretching out his hands to them.
<q>A God! a God!</q> he cried, and
was for a moment silent.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger turned away,
shuddering at this image of Divinity
in the dust.
</p>

<p>
Yet he had not gone far when,
in spite of him, his feet were drawn
back.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse stood beside the
great black and white crucifix, to
which he did not seem to dare to
lift his eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>The cup is at his lips at last!
<hi rend='italic'>He has lost sight of the Father!</hi> The
Lord has laid upon him the iniquities
of us all. All the murders,
all the adulteries of the world are
on him; all the sacrileges are on
him; all the brutality, the foulness,
the lies, the treacheries, the
meannesses, the cruelties&mdash;they are
all heaped upon him. All iniquities,
past, present, and to come,
overclouded and hid his divine
innocence out of sight. And the
Father, seeing him so, relented not,
spared him not, but poured on his
head the full measure of his hatred
of our sins, as if he were the criminal
who was guilty of them all.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger started back as
if lightning had flashed in his face,
uttered a faint cry, and hurried
from the church.
</p>

<p>
He knew why the veil of the temple
was rent and the face of the
<pb n='505'/><anchor id='Pg505'/>
sun darkened; and he knew why
the Son of God had bled at every
pore.
</p>

<p>
He walked once rapidly round
the square, baring his head to the
tender coolness of the air. When
he reached the church again, F.
Chevreuse had finished speaking,
and was just turning away. But
he paused, as he saw Mr. Schöninger
walk up the aisle as unconscious
of the astonished congregation
who gazed at him as if the
church had been empty.
</p>

<p>
He knelt at the communion railing.
</p>

<p>
<q>F. Chevreuse,</q> he said in a
voice that every one heard, so still
were all, <q>I have not yet kissed the
cross on which my God was crucified.</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse drew the small crucifix
from his girdle, and presented
it, his hands trembling and tears
rolling down his face; and all the
congregation fell on their knees
while the Jew kissed the cross on
which his God was crucified.

<p>
In this little volume the Rev. F.
de Ponlevoy has faithfully recorded
the <hi rend='italic'>Acts</hi>, as he well entitles
them, of five brave men of our own
time, who went forth <q>rejoicing,</q>
like the apostles of old, <q>that they
were accounted worthy to suffer
reproach for the name of Jesus.</q>
</p>

<p>
The author has not attempted a
biography or any detailed account
of the lives of these brave men previous
to their arrest <q>in the name of
the Commune,</q> but simply an exact
statement, far more impressive, of
their known words and acts from
that moment which so plainly
marked them as chosen ones of
God.
</p>

<p>
These Jesuit fathers suffered in
most saintly companionship, and
the world will heartily echo the
pious wish of our author that other
societies may do for their martyred
brethren that which he has so lovingly
accomplished for his.
</p>

<p>
The Jesuits in Paris during the
war of 1870 saw plainly the gathering
signs of darker days yet to come
for France; but it is not in their
traditions to yield anything to fear,
and so they were resolved, the
moment the armistice was concluded,
to open their school of S.
Geneviève and College of Vaugirard.
At the very beginning of
the war with Prussia, these two establishments
had been freely passed
over to the military authorities for
the use of the sick and wounded,
hundreds of whom had been there
received and tenderly cared for,
many of the fathers attaching themselves
to the ambulances and hospitals
with the utmost devotion.
Consequently these buildings now
needed many repairs and to be
almost entirely refurnished. The
residence in the Rue Lafayette had
<pb n='506'/><anchor id='Pg506'/>
fared better, as the greater part of
the community were Germans who
had been obliged to leave France
at the beginning of the war, while
the house fell under the protection
of the American minister, charged
by Prussia to watch over the interests
of its people in Paris. Add to
which this modest mission had the
deserved reputation of being very
poor&mdash;not much of a bait for the
blood-hounds of the Commune. At
the house in the Rue de Sèvres such
measures were taken as prudence
seemed to suggest, leaving the rest
to Providence. Thus at first it
had seemed best to keep some
members of the order in Paris&mdash;men
at once necessary and willing
to stay. Some were sent to the
provinces, and others remained
scattered throughout the ungrateful
capital. At the conclusion of
the armistice the College of Vaugirard
was hastily prepared for pupils,
and its reopening fixed for the 9th
of March, by which time nearly
two hundred students had applied
for admission. But on the 18th
the long-threatened revolution burst
forth, and the rector, more anxious
for the pupils than for the fathers,
hurried both to the country-house
of the college, at Moulineaux, between
Issy and Meudon. However,
they were soon compelled to
retreat precipitately, first to Versailles,
and finally to Saint Germain-en-Laye;
for, placed exactly
in the narrow belt between the
belligerent lines, they found themselves,
upon the breaking out of
hostilities between Paris and Versailles,
veritably between two fires.
The deserted College of Vaugirard
was surrounded, occupied, and
pillaged, but no one was there to
be arrested.
</p>

<p>
The school of S. Geneviève required
more time for repairs, and
was to be opened on March 20; but
the insurrection, coming in the interval,
necessitated new delays, and
parents were notified to await further
announcements. The rector,
F. Léon Ducoudray, born at Laval,
May 6, 1827, a man of great spirit
and energy, was not one to lose
time or to be dismayed in the hour
of trial. He at once sent out four
of the fathers, one to negotiate a
loan in England or Belgium to
meet the exigencies of the moment,
and the others to seek in the provinces
an asylum for the exiled
school, which was finally removed
to a country-house at Athis-Mons,
on the railway line to Orléans, not
far from Paris. The pupils were
notified that the school would open
on April 12; the rector, who had
remained in Paris to superintend
the final arrangements, was to join
his community on Monday, the
third.
</p>

<p>
On Sunday, the second, F. Ducoudray
perceived that F. Paul
Piquet, a sick priest left at S. Geneviève,
was rapidly sinking, and at a
quarter-past eight in the evening
this good father had the happiness
of leaving this world and its momentarily-increasing
trials. It was
a great loss to the house, and at
this time a very painful embarrassment.
The next morning (Monday)
the Commune issued a decree confiscating
all the furniture and property
belonging to religious houses,
and at S. Geneviève they every instant
expected a visit on the part
of the new rulers of the city. Nevertheless,
F. Ducoudray sent for
several of the fathers to come up
from Athis to attend the funeral
ceremonies of the deceased priest,
set for Tuesday, April 4.
</p>

<p>
All at once, just after midnight on
Tuesday, before these fathers had returned
to Athis, the buildings were
<pb n='507'/><anchor id='Pg507'/>
encircled by a battalion of National
Guards, armed to the teeth. The
Rue Lhomond, the Rue d'Ulm, the
Passage des Vignes, the very woodyard
at the foot of the garden, all
were guarded. There were repeated
blows at the door of No. 18.
The brother porter went at once to
say that the keys, according to
custom, were in the rector's room,
and that he would go and get them.
But at this simple and reasonable
answer the outsiders got into a
rage; a summons was sounded three
times at rapid intervals; the whole
neighborhood was startled by a
general discharge at all the windows
of the Rue Lhomond; there
were loud threats of bringing cannons
and <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>mitrailleuses</foreign> from the
Place de Panthéon near by. Presently
the doors were opened, and
the rector himself appeared, calmly
requesting to be allowed to make
some remarks in the name of common
justice and of individual liberty.
But the day for these things
had gone by. For sole response
the leader signified, revolver in
hand, that he constituted the rector
his prisoner in the name of the
Commune, and should occupy and
search the house for the arms and
munitions of war therein concealed.
But in reality they were here, as
everywhere else, on a hunt for the
cash-box. <q>That which we most
need,</q> said a member of the Commune,
<q>is money.</q>
</p>

<p>
Right away every one in the
house was on his feet, and each one
followed his instinct; but first of all
one priest hurried to the private
chapel, where, for precaution, the
Blessed Sacrament had been previously
placed, and hastened to secure
it against profanation.
</p>

<p>
The envoys of the Commune
were in number and force enough
to carry on several operations at
once. They arrested everybody
they could lay their hands on&mdash;priests,
lay brothers, even the servants
of the school&mdash;and, as fast as
they found them, seated them in the
entrance hall, and kept them there
for several hours. They ransacked
the entire house; the rector himself
led them everywhere. The
search was very long and very minute,
without the desired result; for
they found no arms and very little
money. F. Ducoudray, without
falsifying himself in the slightest,
replied with so much unconcern,
with such dignity and politeness,
that they said to each other in astonishment:
<q>What a man this is!
What energy of character!</q> At
last, after three painful hours, they
took him to the hall; but even from
the first moment they separated
him from his brethren, and put him
in a little vestibule of the chapel in
front of the parlors. It is almost
superfluous to add that the pillage
of the house commenced almost at
once, accelerated, and the next day
completed, by bands of women and
children.
</p>

<p>
At five in the morning the recall
was sounded; it was the signal for
defiling and departing for the préfecture
of the police. The prisoners
were ranged between two lines
of National Guards. First came the
rector, a little ahead of the others;
behind him the Rev. FF. Ferdinand
Billot, Emile Chauveau, Alexis
Clerc, Anatole de Bengy, Jean Bellanger,
Theodore de Regnon, and
Jean Tanguy, four lay brothers, and
seven servants.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well,</q> said F. Ducoudray, with
a radiant countenance, to F. Caubert,
who was nearest him. <q><foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Ibant
gaudentes</foreign>,<note place='foot'><q>They went forth rejoicing.</q></note> did they not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is he saying there?</q> asked
<pb n='508'/><anchor id='Pg508'/>
the uneasy guards. F. Caubert
repeated the sentence; God knows
what they understood by it!
</p>

<p>
At the préfecture a major exclaimed:
<q>Why have you brought
me these rascals (<foreign rend='italic'>coquins</foreign>)? Why
didn't you shoot them on the spot?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Gently,</q> answered one of the
guard; <q>it is necessary to proceed
calmly, or you yourself might get it
before the rest.</q>
</p>

<p>
The same officer then asked, revolver
in hand, for the director.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am here,</q> replied F. Ducoudray,
advancing.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know that you have arms concealed
in your house.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, sir.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have it on certain authority.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If there are any, it is without
my knowledge.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You have an iron will. We are
going to see about that, we two; and
if we do not find them, you do not
get back here.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then followed a number of
charges against the priests, such as
poisoning the sick and wounded in
the hospitals and ambulances, perversion
of youth, and complicity
with the government of Versailles.
F. Ducoudray, following the example
of his divine Master, made no
reply, and, after being loaded with
insults, was finally taken secretly
and locked up in a cell of the <hi rend='italic'>Conciergerie</hi>
prison. The others were
confined in a common hall of the
depot prison, intended for vagrant
women.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, two priests and
one brother, who had escaped detection
in the tumult, remained at
S. Geneviève. The brother was an
invalid confined to his bed, and the
two priests, one of whom had been
concealed all night in the garden,
met in his room after the guards
had left, and it remained for nearly
two months virtually their prison.
</p>

<p>
The saintly president of the house
of the Rue de Sèvres, F. Pierre Olivaint,
had seen all his flock sheltered
from the gathering storm, and
on that Monday was alone in the
house with one reverend companion,
F. Alexis Lefebvre, and several
devoted brothers, incapable of fear.
All day long warnings and entreaties
poured in upon him to cause
him to fly in advance of the impending
visit from the Commune.
<q>But what would you have?</q> he answered
tranquilly. <q>I am like the
captain of a vessel, who must be
the last to leave the ship. If we
are taken to-day, I shall have but
one regret: that it is Holy Tuesday,
not Good Friday.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, now, my child,</q> he said
again, at six o'clock, to one who
implored him to save himself while
there was yet a moment, for it was
certain there was to be a visit
on the part of the Commune that
very evening&mdash;<q>why, now, my child,
why do you excite yourself? Is it
not the best act of charity we can
perform to give our life for the love
of Jesus Christ?</q> And then he
went to the lower floor, facing the
hall door, and calmly went on with
his office. <q>I am waiting,</q> he
said to a friend who passed by,
pressing his hand.
</p>

<p>
Just as they were assembling in
the refectory for the evening collation,
at the usual hour of a quarter-past
seven, the brother porter was
summoned; a delegate of the Commune
was at the door, behind him
a company of National Guards.
The brother was instructed to detain
them in the vestibule or in the
parlor until the superior himself
should come. Brother Francis did
so, in spite of the impatience and
threats of the visitors. In anticipation
of this visit, but two hosts had
been left in the morning, and now
<pb n='509'/><anchor id='Pg509'/>
each father hurried to his room, and
each had his <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>viaticum</foreign> ready. F.
Lefebvre returned the first, soon
followed by F. Olivaint. The delegate
announced the object of his
mission&mdash;to look for arms and munitions
kept in reserve by the Jesuits;
but, being himself called away
on important business, deputed
citizen Lagrange to take his place.
This man, well worthy of the deed,
ordered every avenue of escape to
be guarded, and then, followed by
nearly half his force, began the tour
of inspection, accompanied by F.
Olivaint, and preceded by two brothers,
one with a light, the other
carrying the keys; two other brothers
were stationed at the entrance
with the guards, and, as each room
was examined, Lagrange left two
of his men to guard it. To have any
idea of the shameless impiety and
vulgar insolence of these functionaries
of the Commune, one must
have seen and heard them; for
three hours the search continued,
amid threats and mockery, through
all which F. Olivaint remained
calm and reserved.
</p>

<p>
The critical moment came while
in the procurator's chamber, where
the cash-box was discovered. <q>Hurry
and open it,</q> they cried.
<q>Where's the key?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I haven't it; it is not even here,</q>
answered F. Olivaint. <q>Our father
procurator, who is absent, has it with
him.</q> Then came the tempest; one
of the brothers was sent off with
three guards, arms in hand, to hunt
up the father procurator, and bring
him back alive or dead. In the
end, F. Caubert really did arrive,
and opened the box. It was empty.
Naturally, the siege had suppressed
all receipts and increased
all expenses; for a long time the
Jesuits had lived only by borrowing.
<q>We are robbed,</q> Lagrange
exclaimed. <q>All right, the superior
and the steward are my prisoners,
in the name of the Commune. Off
to the préfecture of police!</q> F.
Lefebvre begged to be taken with
his brethren. <q>No, no,</q> was the
answer. <q>You stay here and hold
this house in the name of the Commune.</q>
And actually the sentence
was prophetic; for the house guarded
by F. Lefebvre was spared with him.
</p>

<p>
At about half-past eleven o'clock
the two prisoners departed, never
to return; they sought in vain for
a carriage, to make the long transit.
As they passed out, F. Olivaint
saw, in the crowd in the street,
a group of compassionate friends;
he saluted them with a smile, as if
to say: <q>Weep not for me.</q>
</p>

<p>
Lagrange and his company quartered
themselves at the Place Vendôme,
as proud of their prowess
that night as if they had captured
Versailles; a single <foreign rend='italic'>piquet</foreign> of armed
men took the prisoners to the
préfecture, and there, instead of
being placed with the others in the
common hall, they were immediately
and secretly locked up in the
cells of the <hi rend='italic'>Conciergerie</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<q>FF. Olivaint and Caubert are in
prison,</q> F. Lefebvre wrote to our
author at Versailles. <q>They absolutely
would not take me. I am
alone at the house, with Brother
Bouillé, both fearless, thank God!
The others are dispersed, and come
from time to time to see me. I
have placed the Blessed Sacrament
in the gallery near my room, and,
when they return, I shall consume
the sacred hosts. The church will
be closed. They are arresting the
priests. Monseigneur himself is at
the préfecture of police; they say
these are the hostages, I am told.
Pray, pray for me, my father! Oh!
how happy I should be to give my
life for our Lord!</q>
</p>

<pb n='510'/><anchor id='Pg510'/>

<p>
F. Ducoudray accepted his imprisonment
without any surprise.
<q>Before long,</q> he had said, on
March 19, to the Prince de Broglie&mdash;<q>before
long our churches will be
closed, our houses devastated, our
persons arrested, and God knows
who will regain his liberty. The
things which are to be done will
have a particular character of hatred
to God, and&mdash;that which is very
sad for a priest to say&mdash;there will
prove to be no other argument for
the miserable ones who are to be
masters of Paris than the cannon.
I have lived for seven months in
the very midst of these men, and I
have not met with one heart or one
honest mind among them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For six months,</q> he wrote under
date of Feb. 20, <q>I have seen
only grief and mourning.... My
God! must I say to you that I
can still hope? Paris has lost the
last fibre of moral and religious
sense. Its population is mad, delirious.
Can we hope for the return
of divine mercy when this immense
city thinks only of founding
a society based on the absence of
religion and on the hatred of God?
Only a miracle can help us out of
the abyss in which we are plunged.
I hold my peace.... My heart is
too heavy, and my soul too gloomy.</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Olivaint, loving his country
not less, was filled with joy from
the very moment of his arrest.
<q><hi rend='italic'>Ibant gaudentes</hi>,</q> he said with
sparkling eyes to the archbishop's
secretary, who passed his grating&mdash;<q><hi rend='italic'>Ibant
gaudentes</hi>; it is for the same
Master!</q> <q>France,</q> he said, <q>like
the world, requires to be ransomed
by blood&mdash;not the blood of criminals,
which sinks into the ground,
and remains mute and barren, but
the blood of the just, which cries
to heaven, invoking justice and
imploring mercy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There must be victims,</q> said F.
Caubert. <q>It is God who has chosen
them.</q>
</p>

<p>
On the evening of Holy Thursday
there came a change. The
archbishop, the president, Bonjeau,
FF. Ducoudray, Clerc, and de Bengy,
each in a separate compartment
of a prison carriage, were conveyed
from the <hi rend='italic'>Conciergerie</hi> to the prison
of Mazas. F. Olivaint and F. Caubert
were left alone at the <hi rend='italic'>Conciergerie</hi>,
in separate cells, debarred
from all possible communication.
</p>

<p>
<q>And from this hour,</q> cries F.
Ponlevoy, in tender remembrance,<note place='foot'>P. 46.</note>
<q>I seem to myself to be really writing
an episode of the Catacombs.
The church is ever fruitful in generous
souls, but it is the hour of
trial that more than any lays bare
the depths of the heart; and if, on
one side, there is in the martyrs a
patience beyond all grief, there is
in the Christian a charity stronger
than death itself.</q>
</p>

<p>
A system of correspondence was
organized outside those now hallowed
prison walls, and continued to
the very end, consoling and sustaining
the captives, and laying up
treasures for the faithful far and
wide through the edifying little
notes thus preserved. And finally,
on Thursday, April 13, safe means
were found to convey to the prisoners
at the <hi rend='italic'>Conciergerie</hi> not simply a
consolation, but the Consoler himself.
Only a few hours after this
was accomplished, FF. Olivaint and
Caubert were removed to Mazas,
whither three of their order, as we
have seen, had preceded them.
</p>

<p>
The prison of Mazas, on the
boulevard of the same name, is
constructed on the system of cells.
At its door all motion ceases; life
itself fades out; the isolation is
<pb n='511'/><anchor id='Pg511'/>
complete; the unfortunate detained
there are buried alive. But the
love and devotion of the faithful
contrived to pierce even these
gloomy walls, and letters were again
carried back and forth between
the imprisoned priests and their
exiled brethren. These letters contained
few facts, but, put together,
make a most exquisite journal of the
interior life of the saintly captives.
F. Ducoudray opens this series of
letters by a formal one to his superior,
giving an account of the
situation and of his own personal
disposition. <q>You know our history
and its sadness,</q> he writes.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Here I pass much time in prayer,
and a little in suffering. Isolation,
separation, uncertainty, and, above
all, the privation of not being able
to celebrate Mass&mdash;this is indeed
cruel!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>No possible communication
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>cum concaptivis meis</foreign>. They are
there, near to me, in the same corridor;
that is all I know.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>This is the part it is the will of
God we should perform. For us,
we have only to follow the apostle's
counsel: <q><foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>In omnibus exhibeamus
nosmetipsos, sicut Dei ministros, in
multa patientia, in tribulationibus,...
in carceribus, in seditionibus, ... per
gloriam et ignobilitatem, per infamiam
et bonam faman</foreign>.</q><note place='foot'><q>But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as
the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation,
... in prisons, in seditions, ... through
honor and dishonor, through infamy and good
name.</q>&mdash;2 Cor. vi. 4-8.</note></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Say to my friends,</q> F. Olivaint
wrote to one of his brethren, <q>that
I do not find anything to complain
of; health pretty good; not a
moment of <foreign rend='italic'>ennui</foreign> in my retreat,
which I continue up to the very
neck.... I know nothing of my
companions.</q> <q>I thank you from
the bottom of my heart,</q> to another,
<q>for your charity to the poor
prisoners. Here is a work I did
not fully comprehend until I was in
prison. How well you practise it&mdash;I
might almost say too well!... No,
the time does not seem long to me.</q>
... <q>In reality,</q> he writes again,
<q>I do very well in body; and as for
the spirit, it seems to me that I am
making a retreat of benediction,
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Deo gratias</foreign>.</q> ... Later on: <q>I
am at the twenty-fourth day of my
retreat. I had never hoped that a
retreat of a month would be granted
me; and see, now I am touching
that term. Well, if we do not regain
our liberty by the end of the
month, I shall not, I hope, lose anything
in this way by the prolongation
of the trial. You will understand
that here we have no news
to give. And those frightful cannon
that never cease grumbling! But
that, too, reminds me to pray for
our poor country. If it were required
to give my miserable life to
put an end to its troubles, how
quickly I would make the sacrifice!</q>
</p>

<p>
Those cannon jarred on the ears
of the other captives. <q>We hear
day and night the roar of cannon,</q>
F. Clerc wrote to his brother.
<q>I conclude that the siege and my
detention will not end to-morrow....
People talk of the cloister of religious
houses; that of Mazas is not
to be despised.... We have
neither Mass nor sacraments.
Never, I well believe, did prisoners
more desire them. I pray to the
good God, I study, I read, I write
a little, and I find time goes quickly,
even at Mazas.... Do not
take further measures to see me;
I fear further efforts would bring
you annoyance, and I have little
hope of the result. These gates
will be opened by another hand
than yours; and, if they open not,
we know well that we must be
<pb n='512'/><anchor id='Pg512'/>
resigned.... I am proud and
happy to suffer for the name I bear.
You know well the blow did not
take me by surprise. I did not
desire to evade it, and I wish to
support it. I do not hope for the
deliverance of which you speak....
The less I am master of myself, the
more I am in the hands of God;
there will happen to me what he
wills, and he will give me to do
that which he wishes I should do.
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Omnia passum in eo qui me confortat.</foreign></q>
</p>

<p>
F. Caubert writes in the same
tone: <q>My health up to the present
remains good. For the rest, I
have all that is necessary, and even
over. Besides, the moral serves to
strengthen the physical in giving
courage and strength. Now, this
comes to me because I am full of
confidence in God, and most happy
to do his will in all that he really
demands of me. For the rest, the
prison rule, in spite of its stern and
austere side, is not in itself injurious
to the health. They have us
take the air every day for an hour,
solitarily, and each in his turn.
The delicate stomachs can obtain
the food they need. Twice a week
they give us soup and a bit of beef.
The house is conducted with propriety,
order, and regularity....
We can visit the doctor or the
apothecary daily. There is a library
comprising a pretty good
number of books of great variety,
and any one can ask for them to
pass the time. As for the details
of the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>ménage</foreign>, that which they
bring me is quite sufficient, and I
need no more. It simplifies matters
not to have my cell encumbered,
otherwise I should get things
a little pell-mell.</q>
</p>

<p>
To hear these good fathers, everything
was right, everybody good to
them. Undoubtedly they suffer,
but, as they are patient, they suffer
less than others; as they have hope,
they endure better than others;
finally, as they love Christ crucified,
their joy is greater than their
pain. A Frenchman and a Jesuit
conquered by hard treatment or
most distressing privation! Never!
Starving, dying by inches, in stripes
and in prison, under the tomahawk,
at the stake, in hunger and
thirst, in burning India or the
snows of Canada, at the mercy of
Western savages or Paris revolutionists,
it is ever the same thing&mdash;everything
is right and nice and fine;
much better than could be expected.
The story, fresh in our minds,
of our own early missionaries, exiles
of the first Revolution, prepares
us to hear the sweet patience of the
American forests echoing to-day in
the prison of Mazas. God wills it.
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Ad majorem Dei gloriam.</foreign>
</p>

<p>
M. Ponlevoy, who had the tender
curiosity to visit the prison of Mazas
on a holiday, when it could
easily be inspected, says: <q>I saw
those three stories of long corridors,
with double galleries, radiating
around a centre where lately
there was a chapel&mdash;ah! if the
Commune had but had at least
the humanity to leave to the captives
the divine Prisoner of the
tabernacle&mdash;on both sides, on all
the floors, the doors loaded with
bolts and provided with regular
gratings, and those narrow cells, of
which the inventory could be made
in a single glance! Facing the entrance,
the grated window, which
measured the air and light; in one
corner the hammock; opposite, the
little table, with just room enough
for a straw chair; behind the door
a plank for a cupboard, a broom,
and some pieces of coarse crockery
completed the furniture. As
for the famous promenade so often
<pb n='513'/><anchor id='Pg513'/>
mentioned in their letters, it was a
little triangular prison-yard, shut in
by a grating in front, and walls on
the sides, without shelter anywhere,
and no other seat than a stone in
one corner. During their solitary
recreation the captives could absolutely
see no one, unless the guard
under the arch who held them in
surveillance.</q>
</p>

<p>
But the human heart is still human,
however resigned the will.
Say what they would, the prison was
still a prison, and Mazas certainly
was more like Calvary than paradise.
After all, Christians are not stoics,
and the martyr himself feels the
weakness of the flesh, that he may
overcome it by the vigor of the spirit.
</p>

<p>
<q>This poor heart!</q> writes brave
F. Ducoudray. <q>It sometimes will
be tempted to escape and to bound.
The imagination willingly takes its
part. Neither lets itself be ruled
as much by reason as I would wish.
Thence come, at times, certain fits
or impressions of weariness, the suffering
of the soul, throwing it into
languor, discouragement, uneasiness,
and disgust. <q><foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Magnum est et
val de magnum, tam humano quant divino
posse carere solatio et pro honore
Dei, libenter exilium cordis velle sustinere.</foreign></q><note place='foot'><q>It is a great, a very great virtue to know
how to lack all consolation, human as well as divine,
and to endure willingly for the glory of God
the exile of the heart.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Imit.</hi>, i. 2, c. ix.</note>
There is matter in that one
comprehends only when one feels it.
I had the good thought, when
leaving the house, to put into
my pocket a small volume containing
the <hi rend='italic'>New Testament</hi> and the
<hi rend='italic'>Imitation</hi>. I have read S. Paul
much. What a great and admirable
heart! It expands my soul to
read it, for it has been <q><foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>in laboribus
plurimus, in carceribusabundantius</foreign>,</q><note place='foot'><q>In many more labors, in prisons more frequently.</q>&mdash;2
Cor. xi. 23.</note>
as he writes himself. And I, though
I am yet but a <foreign rend='italic'>carcere uno</foreign>, I boast
of suffering somewhat. But if we
are those of whom it is written:
<q><foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Eritis odio omnibus propter nomen
meum</foreign>,</q><note place='foot'><q>And you shall be hated by all men for my
name's sake.</q>&mdash;Matt. x. 22.</note> how contemptible our tribulations
in comparison with those
of the great apostle!</q> <q>I am still,</q>
he wrote at another time, May 5,
<q>more ill omened than the greatest
pessimist. You tell me they fix the
20th as the final term of the civil
war. I much fear it will be prolonged
even to the 30th. Military
operations go slowly. The war beyond
the ramparts offers difficulties;
the war of the streets has its
difficulties also&mdash;most bloody ones,
alas!... We touch upon the
week of great events, or, at least, the
beginning of great events....
What a punishment! It was expected.
It is here.</q>
</p>

<p>
Two or three human consolations
were vouchsafed the prisoners,
after a time. On May 5 they
were permitted to read several of
the daily papers approved by the
Commune, and about the same
time F. Ducoudray had the inestimable
privilege of twice seeing
and saluting, at a short distance, F.
Clerc, and of once seeing far off
F. Bengy, his beloved brethren and
fellow-prisoners.
</p>

<p>
In May another favor was vouchsafed.
F. Clerc's brother had been
incessant in his attempts to obtain
an interview with him, but without
any success; at last a dear friend,
a lady, received permission to visit
the prisoner, and, as a French lady
must needs have an escort, she
took M. Clerc for hers. This was
an inexpressible happiness to the
noble-hearted priest, and his thanks
to God for the favor were boundless.
F. Caubert, whose simple
and exquisite letters, full of golden
<pb n='514'/><anchor id='Pg514'/>
thoughts, we would gladly linger
over if there were only space
enough, received, May 11, a visit
from the Minister Plenipotentiary
of the United States, which
was very agreeable to him. <q>It
appears,</q> he said, <q>that I had been
recommended to him by some person
of his acquaintance. He came
to inquire most cordially, in true
American style, how I got along,
and if I had need of anything.</q>
Here, in uncertainty, inaction,
and shut out from all the world,
these brave men made light of all
the trials and privations to which
their bodies were so long and painfully
subjected. The Communists
knew too much, however, to think
of breaking their spirit by bodily
suffering; they had the means of
creating cruel anguish in the heart
of every priest within those prison
walls, and well they knew how to
use it. From every cell came a
cry such as no rack or stake
could draw from them.
</p>

<p>
On Easter Sunday, fifth day of
their confinement, F. Clerc wrote
to his brother: <q>To-day is the
feast of feasts, the Pasch of the
Christians, the day the Lord has
made. For us there is no Mass to
say or hear.</q> Just at the hour of
leaving the <hi rend='italic'>Conciergerie</hi>, FF. Olivaint
and Caubert had the happiness, so
longed for and so unexpected, of
receiving the <q>Consoler himself.</q>
Then came the long days at Mazas,
and no such consolation possible.
<q>Oh! if we could but soon ascend
the altar!</q> cries F. Ducoudray in
the early days at Mazas. <q>Here is
a privation to which I can never
become accustomed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Here,</q> F. Clerc wrote May 5&mdash;<q>here
 no confession, no Mass, not
even on Sunday. We are lodged,
fed&mdash;it is enough for animals.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I pass my time,</q> F. Ducoudray
again, <q>praying much, suffering
some; for the privation of the Holy
Mass, the isolation, the separation,
are cruel, but I see not the end.</q>
</p>

<p>
On May 8 an order was promulgated
which put an end to all
visits; on that very day F. Ducoudray
had expected to receive our
Lord himself. <q>What a sacrifice!</q>
he exclaims. <q>I have offered to
our Lord this hard trial, incomparably
more painful yesterday
than ever, on account of the precious
pledge of the love of the divine
Master. I seek to make my
poor heart the altar on which I
sacrifice. I shall add that of yesterday
as new fuel to the sacrifice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Six Sundays passed in darkness,</q>
writes F. Olivaint, May
14. <q>How many days without
ascending to the altar!</q> And the
next day: <q>I am at the forty-first
day of my retreat. After to-day,
I intend to meditate only on the
Eucharist. Is it not the best
means of consoling myself that I
cannot ascend to the altar? If I
were a little bird, I would go somewhere
every morning to hear Mass,
and then I would willingly come
back to my cage.</q>
</p>

<p>
The fathers outside the prison
walls, understanding well the longing
indicated by these and similar
expressions, had endeavored in
every way to find means to answer
their desires. But it required infinite
precautions to secure the
faithful and sure transmission
through all the formalities of surveillance.
What is there prudence
and love together may not accomplish?
At last the doors opened;
the prisoners came not out, but the
Redeemer entered. Towards mid-day
of the 15th the Long-Desired
arrived. That tells all. Only FF.
Ducoudray, Olivaint, and Clerc
could be reached at first. Each of
<pb n='515'/><anchor id='Pg515'/>
these was given four sacred hosts,
and each preserved and carried on
his breast, as on a living altar, the
<hi rend='italic'>God of his heart and his heritage for
all eternity</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is no more prison,</q> F.
Clerc wrote to his brother, <q>no
more solitude; and I have confidence
that if our Lord permits the
wicked to satisfy their malice, and
for a few hours to prevail, he will
profit by them in that very moment
to glorify his name by the feeblest
and vilest of his instruments.</q>
</p>

<p>
Once again, May 22, an opportunity
was found to reach the captives.
Two feeble but intrepid
women traversed the vast, deserted
districts to Mazas. This time all
measures had been taken, and each
prisoner received a share&mdash;four sacred
hosts wrapped in a corporal,
as in a shroud, duly enclosed in a
little box with a silk case and a
cord, in order that it might be carried
around the neck. Coming at
that hour, the Saviour seemed to
say again: <q>I return, not to live
with you, but to carry you with
me.</q> For the end was at hand.
</p>

<p>
We linger for a few moments
over the last letters gathered here
in a most fragrant, fadeless wreath.
On the 16th F. Clerc wrote his last
letter, truly his <hi rend='italic'>nunc dimittis</hi>:
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Ah! my God, how good thou
art! How true it is that the mercy
of thy heart will never fail!...
I had not dared conceive the hope
of such a blessing&mdash;to possess our
Lord, to have him for companion
of my captivity, to carry him on my
heart, and to rest on his, as he permitted
to his beloved John! Yes,
it is too much for me, and my
thought cannot compass it. And
still it is. But is it not true that
all men and all the saints together
could not conceive the Eucharist?
O the God of the Eucharist! how
good he is, how compassionate, how
tender! Does it not seem as if he
made again the reproach: <hi rend='italic'>You have
asked nothing in my name; ask now,
and you shall receive?</hi> I have him
now without having asked; I have
him now, and I will never leave him
more, and my desire, fainting for
want of hope, is reanimated, and will
only increase in the measure that
possession lasts.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Ah! prison, dear prison, thou
whose walls I have kissed, saying,
<hi rend='italic'>Bona crux</hi>, what happiness thou
hast won me! Thou art no longer
a prison; thou art a chapel.
Thou art no longer even a solitude,
because I am not alone; but my
Lord and my King, my Master and
my God, lives here with me. It is
not only in thought that I approach
him; it is not only by grace that he
approaches me; but he has really
and corporally come to find and
console the poor prisoner. He
wished to keep him company; and
can he not do it, all-powerful as he
is?... Oh! lost for ever, my prison,
which wins for me the honor
to carry my Lord upon my heart,
not as a sign, but the reality of my
union with him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the first days I demanded
with great earnestness that our
Lord should call me to a more excellent
testimony to his name.
The worst days are not even yet
passed; on the contrary, they are
coming near, and they will be so
evil that the goodness of God will
be obliged to shorten them; but, at
all events, we are now drawing near
to them. I had from the first the
hope that God would give me the
grace to die well; at present my
hope has become a true and solid
confidence. It seems to me that I
am prepared for anything through
Him who sustains me and will accompany
me even unto death. Will

he do it? That which I know is,
that if he will not, I shall have a
regret which nothing but submission
to his will can calm.</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Ducoudray gives us his farewell
letter also. It ends with alleluia
in the heart and the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>fiat</foreign> on
the lips:
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>I have received <emph>all</emph>. Tuesday
what a surprise, what joy!... I
am no more alone. I have our
Lord for guest in my little cell....
And it is true, <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>credo</foreign>! On Wednesday
I seemed to live over again
the day of my first communion, and
I surprised myself by bursting into
tears. For twenty-five days I had
been deprived of the rich blessing&mdash;of
my only treasure!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shut myself in the guest-chamber,</q>
he continued, referring to the
room in which the Last Supper
was eaten, and that <q>upper chamber,</q>
in which the disciples remained
concealed until the coming of
the Holy Ghost, <q rend='pre'>and much I wish,
after these ten days which separate
us from Pentecost are passed, to
see again the light of heaven. Between
now and then what events
may arise! We are near the crisis;
but if it is prolonged, we have reason
to fear that horrible events will
take place. I cannot prevent myself
at times from being greatly impressed
at finding myself connected
with such grave circumstances.
But here we make a good retreat,
which will facilitate our entrance
into eternity. I have held myself,
from the first day of my arrival
here, ready for any sacrifice whatever;
for I have the strong, sweet
confidence that if God permits
hostages and victims to be made
of us priests and religious, it will
truly be <hi rend='italic'>in odium fidei, in odium
nominus Christi Jesu</hi>.<note place='foot'>From hatred of the faith, hatred of the name
of Jesus Christ.</note></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We pray, pray much, disposed
to live if God pleases, to die if God
pleases, as worthy children of our
most happy father, S. Ignatius.</q>
</p>

<p>
Happy the pen that is broken
after those last lines.
</p>

<p>
<q>It should be well understood,</q>
wrote F. Caubert, <q rend='pre'>that it is really
God who gives us courage in our
trials; otherwise the courage would
very soon exhaust itself. For me,
I have to run often to prayer to
renew mine, like a poor clock that
has to be wound up every little
while. In a life so isolated, sequestered
and devoid of occupation, <foreign rend='italic'>ennui</foreign>
comes quickly. One can easily
make himself a rule, but we cannot
always read or pray. I should have
experienced much of this in myself
during this my three weeks'
retreat had I not been sustained
by this very dose of prayer. You
understand that in this monotonous
life, whenever the good God hides
his presence (and that is usual, in
order to make the trial greater), one
must often feel the sinking of nature.
But this feeling of weakness
is precisely the very thing that
drives us constantly near to God.
The good God is most admirable
in his manner of sustaining the
soul through these very depressions.
Our feebleness is as a chain
binding us to his strength, and as
an attraction drawing us to his infinite
goodness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You say to me that it must be
that I suffer. In a measure it is
true; but if one had nothing to endure,
the good God would find
nothing in his account. He desires
to show mercy to all, and, that
he may do so, he wills that we
should offer him some sorrows
borne for love of him. Alas! if
one were not a prisoner (I speak
for myself), perhaps he would too
easily forget that charity requires
<pb n='517'/><anchor id='Pg517'/>
that we should have compassion
on poor sinners, and offer something
for their intention. And then is
not the priest the friend of God,
and should he not, by this title,
devote himself to obtaining for his
brothers reconciliation with God,
the father of all&mdash;the father so full
of goodness and so ready for indulgence&mdash;especially
when he hears
himself importuned by the voice of
a friend?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I take little account of the time
of my imprisonment,</q> he wrote
later. <q>I prefer to leave all that in
the hands of God, and to give up
to him the care of all that concerns
me. He knows better than I what
is most useful for my soul. I seek
to remember often that one glorifies
him so much more, the more
that one suffers for his love and to
accomplish his holy will. In reality,
in submitting to the trial, we
practise in an admirable manner
the annihilation of ourself.... Is
it not also by the sacrifice of ourself
that we best imitate our
Lord? It is true that my soul has
not yet reached to that perfection
and to a love so pure and so detached.
It is necessary to pass
through trials to reach this union
with God. He sends them, in his
goodness, to purify the soul and to
break down the obstacles which
oppose themselves to this union.
Pray for me, that I may draw this
profit from my present trial.</q>
</p>

<p>
A few rapidly-written words from
F. Olivaint were the last greeting
from one of the tenderest hearts and
sweetest souls in the world. <q>What
deplorable events!</q> he wrote, May
18, to F. Lefebvre. <q>How well I
understand the weary souls of other
days who fled to the desert! But
it is worth much more to stay in the
midst of perils and difficulties to
save so many unfortunates from
shipwreck. My health is always
good, and, after forty-six days, I am
not tired of my retreat&mdash;just the
contrary.</q> To F. Chauveau:
<q>Thanks from my heart. Yes, we
are nearing the end, by the grace
of God. Let us seek to be ready
for all that comes. Confidence and
prayer! How good our Lord is!
If you but knew how, especially for
several days past, my little cell has
become sweet to me! <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Forsan et
hæc olim meminisse juvabit.</foreign> Who
knows that I may not regret it some
day? I think just as you do&mdash;that
Eugene [Count Eugene de Germiny]
should not interfere; but in the
end, if, by the favor of M. Urbain
and his associates, I have need of
help, I will ask for Eugene. In
any case, thank him for me. Tenderest
remembrances to Armand;
many thanks to all; benedictions to
our friends and benefactors. I believe
that all of our own here are
doing well. For me, I am perfectly
sustained. Once more our Lord
is good! Yours from the heart....
May 19, '71.</q>
</p>

<p>
On Monday, the 22d, the order
was given to proceed at once, and
on the spot, to the execution of all
the hostages confined at Mazas.
This was kept concealed from the
prisoners, but they could not help
suspecting it, from the additional
gloom growing every moment heavier
and more ominous throughout
that ever-gloomy building. The
guards came and went, exchanging
mysterious words among themselves,
replying to the questions of the
condemned by threatening allusion,
or by an affected silence even more
significant. However, the director
of the prison, moved by a sentiment
of humanity, or perhaps of prudence,
ventured to represent to the
imperious Commune that an execution
in a simple house of detention
<pb n='518'/><anchor id='Pg518'/>
would be contrary to all forms and
precedents; and consequently they
were ordered to La Roquette, the
prison for those condemned to
death. It was on this day that the
two pious women succeeded in
reaching Mazas, and giving to each
of the Jesuit priests there four sacred
hosts, with conveniences for
carrying them around the neck.
</p>

<p>
Nearly all were transferred to La
Roquette late in the evening of
May 22d; but there were so many,
the wagons were not large enough
to hold all, and some were left at
Mazas until the next day. What a
moment that must have been when
the prisoners, so long in solitude,
not even knowing who were their
companions in misfortune, came
from their cells, and, meeting in the
office, beheld and recognized one
another! Priests, religious, laymen,
all surrounded the Archbishop of
Paris.
</p>

<p>
The transit was long and painful.
The prisoners, forty in number,
were crowded into baggage-wagons
belonging to the railway of Lyon,
and exposed to the gaze and the
insults of all. They had to cross
the populous quarters of the Faubourg
Saint Antoine and the Bastile,
where the insurrection was still
mistress. The convoy went at a
walk, between two lines of armed
men, followed by the grossest insults
and by a maddened multitude.
<q>Alas! monseigneur,</q> said a priest,
leaning towards the archbishop,
<q>look at your people now.</q>
</p>

<p>
When they reached La Roquette
that night, they were assembled at
once, without any other formality,
in the hall, called by name, and
shown by a person with a lantern
to a long corridor on the lower
floor; and as each one passed on in
the order named, a door opened
and closed upon a captive. The
darkness was intense; but it is good
to remember that in some of the cells
there was the Real Presence, shedding
light and peace. The Commune
was in desperate straits, and
it was at first intended to execute
the victims as soon as they should
arrive at La Roquette; but a few
hours were gained through the
jealousy of the director. In the
cells was a bed, and such a bed!&mdash;a
pile of straw and a coverlet, and
that was all; no tables, not even a
chair. Still, Roquette was better
than Mazas, for the cells were not
vaults, and, though one was locked
up, he was not entombed. And, besides,
they were permitted to see
each other by means of a window
between every two cells, and at recreation,
which they were allowed to
take in a corridor together, and
even in some unoccupied cell opening
into the corridor. Food was
scarce from the first; even bread
was rare. F. Olivaint shared some
little things which remained to him
with the archbishop, and had the
happiness, also, of giving him the
Bread of the Strong, for which the
prelate was overcome with gratitude.
</p>

<p>
Every hour the Commune was losing
ground. It had only strength
left for crime, and it hastened, with
its dying breath, to order the execution
<foreign rend='italic'>en masse</foreign> of the hostages of La
Roquette. This was modified to
sixty at first. At any price the
Commune demanded the head of
the priests&mdash;those hated men who
had troubled the world for eighteen
hundred years.
</p>

<p>
About eight o'clock in the evening
of May 24, when the prisoners
were in their cells, there was heard
a confused noise in the distance&mdash;the
voices of men and of children,
a clamor and laughing that was
still more terrible, mixing with the
<pb n='519'/><anchor id='Pg519'/>
clash of arms. It came nearer and
nearer, and some fifty rascals,
Avengers of the Republic, Garibaldians,
soldiers with all kinds of arms,
National Guards with all sorts of
costumes, <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>gamins</foreign> of Paris, poured
into the prison, hungry for the
blood of six victims, their share.
They rushed the whole length of
the corridor containing the cells
of our dear prisoners, and ranged
themselves at the head of a small
spiral staircase which led to the
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>chemin de ronde</foreign>. As they passed,
each prisoner was pelted through
the grating of his cell with a running
fire of insult and sentence of
death.
</p>

<p>
Then some one, assuming the
office of herald, summoned the
prisoners to be ready and to respond
each one as his name was
called. After that, as each name
was pronounced, a door opened,
and a victim presented himself.
M. Bonjeau, FF. Duguerry, Clerc,
Ducoudray, Allard, and Archbishop
Darboy were the six chosen. All
were present, all were ready, and, in
the order named, the procession
began. The archbishop and his
companions, preceded and followed
by this frightful escort, descended
the dark, narrow staircase one by
one. So unrestrained was the
insolence of the captors that their
leader was obliged to interfere.
<q>Comrades,</q> he cried, <q>we have
something better to do than to
insult them&mdash;that is, to shoot them.
It is the command of the Commune.</q>
</p>

<p>
No place of execution had been
fixed upon. They would have liked
to have had it on the spot, but that
would give too many witnesses; the
first <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>chemin de ronde</foreign> was in view of
the prison windows, and the occupants
of the cells on every floor
could see all, hear all. So they
passed to the second, where they
would be sheltered by high ramparts.
The victims were ranged
in a line at the extreme end of this
path, at the foot of the great outside
wall.
</p>

<p>
Those left behind knelt, prayed,
and held their breath. The fire of
a platoon was heard, followed by a
few scattered shots, then cries of
<hi rend='italic'>Vive la Commune!</hi> which told that
all was over. There were martyrs
now, not victims.
</p>

<p>
Towards morning the bodies
were thrown into a hand-cart and
carried to Père la Chaise, where
they were tossed into a ditch; no
coffins, no ceremony of any kind.
<q>What matters it,</q> F. Olivaint had
said and proved&mdash;<q>what matters
it to a Jesuit, who daily sacrifices
his heart, once to sacrifice his
head?</q>
</p>

<p>
Two days passed, and Friday
came, rainy, and the prisoners
were confined to their corridor.
As they were taking their noon-day
recreation, a delegate of the Commune
appeared, and, standing in
their midst, called off fifteen names.
F. Olivaint was the first. <q>Present,</q>
he answered, crossing the corridor.
F. Caubert was second, and F. de
Bengy third. This last name was
badly written, and worse pronounced.
<q>If you mean to say <hi rend='italic'>de Bengy</hi>,</q>
he replied, <q>it is I, and I am
here.</q>
</p>

<p>
The condemned men asked to be
allowed to go for a moment to their
cells, as some had slippers on, and
no hats. <q>No,</q> was the response,
<q>for what remains for you to do you
are well enough as you are.</q> New
victims were added from other
parts of the prison until there were
fifty in all, the number required by
the Commune.
</p>

<p>
These were taken a long road to
Belleville, a <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>faubourg</foreign> at a great
<pb n='520'/><anchor id='Pg520'/>
distance, in order, probably, to
excite the passions of the mob,
and rouse them once more.
</p>

<p>
The procession started at about
four o'clock from La Roquette.
First came a guard bareheaded, who
loudly announced that these were
Versaillais, made prisoners that
morning. The escort consisted of
five hundred armed men, National
Guards, to whom were added, for
this genial occasion, the <hi rend='italic'>Enfants
Perdus</hi> of Bergeret and rowdies
under various names. Presently
the women, veritable furies, and the
children joined in, howling, shrieking,
imprecating, blaspheming. The
crowd increasing in numbers and
insolence, the guards were obliged
to interfere to protect the prisoners,
not from insult, but from extreme
violence. The fury of the mob
constantly demanded the moment
of execution; a military band was
added to the procession to drown
the clamor and make the crowd
more willing to wait. Finally they
reached the entrance to the <hi rend='italic'>Cité
Vincennes</hi>. The passage is narrow,
the crowd was enormous, and growing
ever more furious as they neared
the end. An aged priest, who
could not keep up, was shot and
killed by a woman, and dragged to
the place of general execution.
After a time, they found some
grounds laid out for country parties
or picnics, and an enclosure, uncovered,
which was intended for a
dancing-hall. The fifty prisoners
were forced into this, jammed
savagely against the walls, while
the crowd showered maledictions
upon them. Then, at about six
o'clock, there took place a scene
absolutely indescribable; not an
execution, but a slaughter. They
were not shot, but massacred. One
discharge followed another; there
was an attempt made to fire by
platoons, but it was badly managed.
The heroines of the Commune
climbed the walls, urging on the
men and insulting the priests.
The tumult at its height lasted for
about fifteen minutes. At seven
o'clock all was ended. The bodies
were left stretched upon the ground
until the next day, when they were
thrown into a cellar or vault.
</p>

<p>
It was the death-throe of the
Commune. The blood of the just
had cried to heaven, and France
lifted up her head. The next day
was Pentecost; the Commune was
crushed, the doors of Roquette
were opened, the bodies of the
martyrs were recovered, and on
Wednesday, May 31, the Jesuit
church, for two months closed
like the rest, was opened once
more, and the funeral ceremonies
of the five of their order whose imprisonment
we have so hastily followed
celebrated with the utmost
solemnity. Their remains now repose
in the Jesuit chapel of the
Rue de Sèvres.

<lg>
<l>The songs and sufferings of our native land,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>The faith that lifts her high all griefs above,</l>

</p>

<lg>
<l>My hand, made strong by years of manly strife,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Has taught my heart to love in manly sort;</l>

<l rend='margin-left: 2'>No more a phantom from the fairy court.</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l>Seldom for us the unequal strife hath ceased:</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Age after age that martyr-crown we bear,</l>
<l>Here in our old untamed, inviolate East,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>The Church for three short centuries bore elsewhere.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Wife of our race must share the heroic mould:</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>A mother 'mid our mothers with calm eye</l>
<l>Must look on death: like that great heart of old</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Must give her own&mdash;if God so wills&mdash;to die!</l>

</p>

<lg>
<l>With this commandment have I bound thine eyes,</l>

</p>

<lg>
<l>In single fight we met: the invader fell;</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Two hosts stood mute, one gloomy, both amazed;</l>
<l>His eyes, the eyes of one that hears his knell,</l>

<l>Forth from that shivered helm outstreamed afar</l>

<head>A Glimpse of the Green Isle. II.</head>

<p>
After mature reflection, the
Lady from Idaho pronounced the
Dublin ladies the most beautiful in
Europe. I consider the judgment
an important one. If the fair arbiter
had any prejudice, it could
only be a general one against the
recognition of beauty in others of
her sex. I have been informed by
young gentlemen of my acquaintance
who profess a thorough knowledge
of womankind that such a
prejudice is not unusual in feminine
minds. I think Madame
Idaho was rather astonished at the
result of her observations. It is
possible that, before her visit to
Ireland, she supposed that feminine
beauty in Ireland offered only one
style: that of the robustious or
<q>Irish washerwoman</q> type. She
did not say so, however. While I
agreed with her, in general, in her
estimate of the Dublin beauties,
I ventured to ask if their lovely
feet were not a trifle too flat and
too large for perfect symmetry.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all,</q> was the reply.
<q>It is the horrid, clumsy, broad-toed
English <foreign rend='italic'>chaussure</foreign> that makes
the ladies' feet look so broad and
flat. If they wore American <foreign rend='italic'>brodequins</foreign>,
their feet would look as
small, in proportion, as&mdash;ahem!&mdash;as
those of any other nation.</q>
</p>

<p>
No more on those feet.
</p>

<p>
Of the various manifestations of
Irish beauty, the most engaging is
the union of black or dark-brown
hair with soft blue eyes, a skin
with the whiteness of milk, and
cheeks with the bloom of the rose.
It is inexpressibly soft and attractive.
And that wonderful blush
that decks the cheek of youth and
age! Is it the soft moisture of the
climate which makes the grass so
green, even in the winter of the year,
that causes the cheek to bloom so
rosily, even in the winter of old
age?
</p>

<p>
A magnificent <foreign rend='italic'>jeunesse</foreign> of the
sterner sex may also be seen on
promenade in Grafton Street every
afternoon. Bright, intelligent-looking,
of splendid physique, well
dressed, not <q>flashy,</q> the students
of the university and the other
colleges&mdash;the picked youth of the
country&mdash;are not inferior in appearance
to any class of young men in
the great educational institutions
either at home or abroad. They
have an amiable weakness for light-colored
Jouvins and single eye-glasses.
You shall not find two
out of twenty unprovided with a
glazing for the left eye. They are
armed with canes&mdash;for use as well
as ornament. I witnessed a
<q>Town and Gown</q> row in January
of 187-, in which the canes did
vigorous service. A little snow
had fallen. Snow is a very precious
thing in Ireland. It does not
last long, and must be used at once.
The foolish janitors had swept the
snow into little heaps. This was
temptation too strong for undergraduates.
Snow-balling commenced.
The young gentlemen
paid their compliments to the town
through the railings of College
Green. The unwashed young gentlemen
<pb n='527'/><anchor id='Pg527'/>
of the town replied vigorously.
The fun grew fast and furious.
In the delightful excitement
of the moment some of the students,
not having the fear of the
board before their eyes, paid their
compliments to some of the dons,
who happened to cross the outer
quadrangle in cap and gown, with
snowballs of no contemptible solidity.
The excitement increased.
The gownsmen went outside the
college grounds, and charged on
the town ragabrashes who were
collected outside. The police intervened
in the interest of order,
and were attacked by both parties.
The policeman is the natural enemy
of the student as well as of the
ragabrash. The police proceeded
to make some arrests among the
leaders of the gownsmen, and began
brandishing their clubs. Snowballs
were thrown aside, and canes
were used. It was a sight to see
the canes go up and down. The
gownsmen succeed in rescuing the
prisoners from the police, and retire
within the walls, taking a captive
policeman with them, and cheering
in triumph. The police invade
the college precincts, and rush to
the rescue of their captured comrade.
They are driven out, and the
victorious students follow them into
the street. The police suddenly
turn on their pursuers, seize one of
the college leaders, and, by a pretty
piece of strategy, lift him on an outside
car, and drive off with him at
full speed to the nearest police station.
Rescue was out of the question,
the <foreign rend='italic'>coup</foreign> was executed so
quickly. Everybody rushes after
the car, and the green is deserted.
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>Et le combat cessa faute de combattants.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
After a week of <q>hearings</q> at
the police court and intense excitement
among the university men,
the ringleaders were fined. The
fines were paid at once. The captured
policeman, who was a little
battered and bruised, received ten
pounds from the students for <q>sticking-plaster.</q>
The board wisely let
off the offenders with a reprimand,
and the trouble ended in a grand
display of fireworks by the students.
</p>

<p>
Old Trinity is an imposing structure.
Life-size statues of Burke
and Goldsmith are placed at either
side of the principal entrance. The
college grounds cover about thirty
acres&mdash;a beautiful green spot in the
heart of the city. In the centre of
the outer quadrangle is a pretty
<foreign rend='italic'>campanile</foreign>. The provost has a
pleasant residence within the college
limits. Entry into the grounds
is free to all. A chief porter, in a
swallow-tailed coat and black-velvet
jockey-cap, watches over the principal
entrance. The examination-hall,
the library, the lecture-rooms, the
museum, etc., are each under
charge of a special Cerberus in a
jockey-cap, who shows you the
room or building under his particular
charge. Each Cerberus expects
a gratuity. He will be very obsequious
if he gets what his modesty
considers a sufficient <foreign rend='italic'>douceur</foreign>, and
the reverse if he does not. The
new museum building is a fine edifice.
The entrance-hall and principal
stair-case are remarkable for
the splendid specimens of every
variety of native marble they contain.
The old rooms, where the
museum now is, are damp and
cheerless. There is an interesting
collection of ancient Irish weapons,
ornaments, etc. What is said to
have been the harp of Brian Boroihme
will be pointed out to you
by the jockey-capped janitor, who
will also inform you that, though
the public is admitted, the collection
<pb n='528'/><anchor id='Pg528'/>
is intended for the use of the
students, and not as an exhibition
of curiosities.
</p>

<p>
Lectures, to which the public are
admitted free, are given twice a
week by the various professors during
term-time. I had the pleasure
of attending some lectures by Sir
Robert Stewart, the professor of
music, and one by the professor of
ancient history. The latter gentleman
handled Mr. Froude in an
eminently courteous and scholarly
manner, but at the same time most
decidedly <q>without gloves.</q> His
lectures, however, were but poorly
attended, while Sir Robert crammed
the examination-hall with the
taste and fashion of Dublin, from
the lady-lieutenant down. All
flocked to hear his comparison of
the Scotch and Irish bag-pipes, illustrated
by performers on these
instruments. Lady Spencer, it
seems, has taken the Irish bag-pipes
under her patronage. Her
ladyship seems to be a very amiable
and charming person, but as to
her taste in musical instruments&mdash;well!
<foreign rend='italic'>dêgustibus non</foreign>.
</p>

<p>
Trinity College is on the east
side of College Green. On the
north is the principal façade of
the old Parliament House. It was
sold to the Bank of Ireland after
the Union. The House of Commons
is now the teller's office.
The principal façade is of the same
order. It is grandly simple and
impressive. The semi-circular colonnades
of Ionic columns produce a
noble effect. This building is said
to be the finest development of the
order among modern structures in
Europe. I am inclined to think
that this pretension is not without
foundation. The dingy appearance
of all public buildings in Ireland
and throughout the British
Islands&mdash;the effect of smoke and
almost continual rain&mdash;detracts
greatly from their effect. A porter
in livery, with a scarlet waist-coat
and a nose to match, shows
you the House of Lords. A statue
of George III. stands where the
throne formerly stood. In all
other respects the room remains
as it was when Ireland had <q>a
Parliament House of her own.</q>
Tapestries of the Siege of Derry
and the Battle of the Boyne are
hung on the walls. If you give your
red-breasted conductor a sufficient
gratuity, he will ask you to <q>take a
chair,</q> that you may be able to say
<q>you had a seat in the House of
Lords.</q>
</p>

<p>
One must not leave College
Green without paying his compliments
to the equestrian statue of
William III., which stands nearly
opposite the Bank of Ireland. The
king is costumed <foreign rend='italic'>en Romain</foreign>. The
bronze representative of the glorious
and pious Dutchman and his
charger have suffered severely at
the hands of their enemies. The
steed's fore-leg, which is raised, as
in the act of stepping, has been
broken off more than once, and replaced
in contempt of proportion.
A curious critic has calculated that,
if the leg were straightened out, it
would prove to be about half a foot
longer than the other legs. A gilded
wreath on the brows of the statue
gives it rather a <q>gingerbread</q>
appearance.
</p>

<p>
At the end of College Street is a
bronze statue of Thomas Moore.
The Dublin critics call it <q>a gloomy
horror that murders the memory</q> of
the poet. The unrivalled songster
is enveloped in a long cloak, and
holds a tablet and pencil. He
seems to be taking an inventory of
the cabs and <q>outsides</q> that pass
his station. The statue reminded
me of that of Mr. Lincoln in
<pb n='529'/><anchor id='Pg529'/>
Union Square. Both have the same
weather-beaten, <q>Ancient Mariner</q>
appearance, even to the trowsers
of truly nautical extent. At the
end of Westmoreland Street&mdash;which
is a continuation of College Street&mdash;is
a statue of William Smith O'Brien,
which is quite respectable in design,
and does not lack spirit in execution.
The artist saw that voluminous
trowsers are incompatible
with bronze or marble.
</p>

<p>
Two minutes' walk brings us to
the City Hall&mdash;formerly the Exchange&mdash;situated
on Cork Hill.
It is a fine building of Portland
stone with a Corinthian portico of
six lofty columns. It is surmounted
by a cupola. In the hall is a statue
of Grattan by Chantrey, one of
O'Connell by Hogan, of Dr. Lucas
by Rontilias, and of the Third
George by Van Nost. If you wish
to see the Council Chamber&mdash;which
has nothing more attractive than
portraits of the various lord-mayors,
O'Connell among the number&mdash;a
gruff and crusty old porter in
blue coat and brass buttons will admit
you, <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>moyennant finance</foreign>. Even
an extra obolus will not soften this
rough old Cerberus.
</p>

<p>
We are now close by the Cork Hill
entrance to <q>the Castle.</q> A figure of
Justice, or Fortitude&mdash;I really forget
which&mdash;surmounts the gate, and
a private of the Coldstream Guards
stands sentry. He will not stop
you, as entry is free to all. About
eleven in the morning is a good
time to visit the castle-yard. At
that hour the guard is relieved, and
a magnificent military band will
delight your ears with most excellent
music.
</p>

<p>
The castle is a rambling structure,
situated in a poor quarter of the
city. There are two quadrangles:
the upper and the lower castle-yard.
In the upper are the apartments
of the viceroy; in the lower,
the offices and the castle chapel.
The only portion of the original
building now standing is the Record
Tower, anciently known as the Ward
Tower. Irish prisoners of state
were here formerly confined. General
Arthur O'Connor, I believe,
was the last state prisoner who had
to endure its hospitality.
</p>

<p>
The castle chapel is really a
Gothic gem. It is built of Irish
limestone and oak. The carving in
the interior is exquisite. The windows
bear the arms of the various
lord-lieutenants in stained glass.
The verger&mdash;a patriarchal-looking
Englishman in a long, gray beard&mdash;was
very polite and attentive.
He looked so <q>respectable,</q> so
venerable, that we hesitated to offer
him a gratuity, lest we might offend
him. He soon undeceived us on
this point, for he accepted an English
shilling; and pocketed it with
an expression of thanks. The
traveller through the three kingdoms
never fails to discover a great
many very respectable-looking persons
who are not above receiving
gratuities of sums from a three-penny
piece upwards.
</p>

<p>
S. Patrick's Cathedral is situated
in a poor and squalid portion
of the city. The poor buildings
which cluster close around it mar
its general effect. It was closed
when we reached it, but a silver
key will open S. Patrick's, like
most other buildings, at most hours.
We were informed that in one of
the dingy tenements hard by we
should find a person who would
admit us. We did find him&mdash;a
man still young, dressed in very
rusty black. He smelled very
strongly of whiskey, <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>entre nous</foreign>.
The interior of the cathedral is
simple and grand. In the choir
hang the helmets, swords, and banners
<pb n='530'/><anchor id='Pg530'/>
of the Knights of S. Patrick.
The spot where Swift and Stella
sleep was the one most interesting
to us, and thither our guide led us
at once. Swift's memorial is a
plain slab of marble affixed to one
of the pillars. He is buried in
front of it. The church is damp
and cold. Our guide seems to
feel the need of another stimulant.
His voice trembles as he reads
the caustic dean's inscription on
Marshal Schomberg's tomb; for
our guide has picked up some
Latin&mdash;off the tomb-stones, probably.
The dean made several applications
to the descendants of
Schomberg for funds to raise a
monument to their deceased ancestor.
But they never vouchsafed
a reply to the dean. He finally
put up a tablet at his own expense.
The inscription, which was written
by him, shows that he was very
bitter on the subject. The place
where Swift lies now needs a little
care. Our conductor said he had
called attention to it in vain; but,
as I said before, he smelt strongly
of the native beverage. There is a
very fine monument to the officers
and men of the 18th Royal Irish
who fell in the Indian Rebellion.
But the oldest and most remarkable
monument in the church is that of
Boyle, the first Earl of Cork. It is
from twenty to thirty feet high, and
represents the earl and countess
lying side by side, surrounded by
their children, thirteen in number,
if I remember rightly. The figures
are kneeling. They are life-size,
and are colored.
</p>

<p>
S. Patrick's has been recently
restored in its original style by a
wealthy brewer of Dublin at a
cost of seven hundred thousand
dollars. It procured him a baronetcy.
The grandeur of the interior
is not marred by pews. The
movable seats&mdash;such as one sees
in Notre Dame and the Madeleine&mdash;are
adopted. A pregnant notice is
posted on each chair. It informs
the public that <q>the future sustentation</q>
of the cathedral depends
solely on the voluntary contributions
made by the public at the
Offertory. Pity the sorrows of the
disendowed Irish Church!
</p>

<p>
We were not able to visit Christ
Church and the tomb of that ancient
filibuster, Strongbow, as the
church was closed for repairs. A
wealthy distiller has undertaken the
restoration of this cathedral at his
own expense. It is said that he
also expects to get a baronetcy
for his money, like his rival, the
manufacturer of <q>Foker's Entire.</q>
Money is a glorious thing, if one
has plenty of it. Tom Stumps, who
sells just enough of man's brain-stealing
enemy to eke out a miserable
living, is a low, disreputable
fellow. Bob Shallow, who manufactures
the liquid madness <foreign rend='italic'>en grana</foreign>
and makes a fortune by selling it
to Tom Stumps and his like, becomes
a distinguished patriot, a
public benefactor, and <q>Sir Robert
Shallow, Esq., Justice of the Peace
and <foreign rend='italic'>coram</foreign>.</q>
</p>

<p>
The cathedral in Marlborough
Street is in the Grecian style, with a
portico of Ionic columns, in imitation,
as we are told, of the façade of
the Temple of Theseus at Athens.
Massive columns separate the nave
and aisles. The interior decorations
are of great richness. In my
humble judgment, they trench on
the florid.
</p>

<p>
The Four Courts, on Usher's
Quay, rise in solemn grandeur
over the Liffey. This building
stands on the site of the ancient
Monastery of S. Savior. It was
finished in 1800. The central front
has a fine portico of six Corinthian
<pb n='531'/><anchor id='Pg531'/>
columns surmounted by a rich pediment.
On the left stands a statue
of Moses. On either side are statues
of Justice and Mercy. At the
extremities of the façades are reclining
figures of Wisdom and Authority.
The main building is flanked
by spacious quadrangles enclosed
by arcades of stone. The
quadrangles are entered by broad
and lofty gateways. The main
hall is circular in shape, and about
seventy feet in diameter. The
<q>Four Courts,</q> Chancery, Queen's
Bench, Exchequer, and Common
Pleas, open into this hall. It is a
busy, buzzing place in term-time.
Lawyers with plenty of briefs, and
plenty of lawyers without briefs,
may be seen there, the former having
hurried interviews with their
clients, the latter dawdling about
with quizzing glasses on their eyes,
exhibiting their wigs and gowns,
and eating oranges and <q>currant-buns.</q>
The court-rooms are small,
uncomfortable, badly lighted, and
ill ventilated. The hall is covered
by a lantern and a dome supported
by Corinthian pillars. In
the spaces between the windows
are allegorical <foreign rend='italic'>alti-relievi</foreign>&mdash;Justice,
Wisdom, Liberty, Law, etc., and
medallions of Moses, Lycurgus,
Solon, and other great law-givers.
During night sessions a colossal
statue of Truth, holding a torch
lit by gas, illuminates the hall.
Over the entrances to the court-rooms
are bas-reliefs of subjects in
English and Irish history. The
hall contains statues of Lord Plunkett
and other legal celebrities.
</p>

<p>
The custom-house is on Custom-House
Quay, four or five
squares east of the Four Courts, and,
like the latter building, looks upon
the Liffey. The riverfront is about
a hundred and thirty yards long.
The portico is Doric. The Union
of England and Ireland is allegorically
represented in <foreign rend='italic'>alto-relievo</foreign>.
The sister kingdoms are sailing
in the same shell, while Neptune
drives away Famine and Despair.
The building is surmounted by
a lofty dome which bears a statue
of Hope.
</p>

<p>
Dublin is well supplied with
means of locomotion at cheap
rates. There are omnibuses, street-railroads,
outsides, insides, covered
cars, and four-wheelers. The four-wheeler
is something the same as
the New York <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>coupé</foreign>. The fares
for cars or <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>coupés</foreign> are sixpence
English per trip for two persons,
sixpence for each additional person,
and an additional sixpence for
each stoppage or <q>set-down.</q> The
street-cars, or <q>tramway cars,</q>
have seats on the roof, which are
a few cents cheaper than the seats
in the interior. The <q>top seats</q>
are much used by all classes in fine
weather. The city ordinances are
very strict regarding cabmen and
car-drivers, and the magistrates
show the <q>jarveys</q> no mercy
when they are proved to have
made overcharges or illegal demands.
The drivers are consequently
very careful in their dealings with
the general public. If you have
a trans-Atlantic flavor about you,
<q>jarvey</q> will expect a gratuity.
You give him his exact fare. In
order to keep within the law, he
does not make a demand for a
greater sum, but, allowing the coin
to rest on his open palm, he looks
at it with an air of superb disdain,
and then, eyeing you with a sidelong
glance, he asks with an air of
primitive innocence:
</p>

<p>
<q>An' what's this for, sir?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For your fare,</q> you reply
sharply, with a determination not
to be imposed upon.
</p>

<p>
<q>Humph!</q> he says. <q>Shure it's
<pb n='532'/><anchor id='Pg532'/>
a mighty long dhrive for half a bob.
Faith, it's hard for a poor divil to
make a livin' nowadays.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ten to one you agree with him,
and give him an additional threepence
or sixpence, which he receives
with enthusiastic wishes
that your life may be prolonged to
an indefinite extent.
</p>

<p>
Our party patronized the four-wheelers
extensively, but never had
the hardihood to venture on an
<q>outside</q> in daylight. We were
averse to public display. During
our stay in Ireland we tried the
<q>outside</q> on one occasion only;
then it was against our will.
Fortunately, it was at night. We
reached Dublin, from a visit to
some friends in the south, by the
10 <hi rend='smallcaps'>p.m.</hi> train. All the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>coupés</foreign> and
covered cars were engaged. Our
lodgings were about two miles
from the railway station. Walking,
with the travelling <q>traps</q>
necessary on British railroads, was
out of the question. We were
compelled to take an <q>outside.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you feel?</q> I asked
the Lady from Idaho after we were
seated and had started.
</p>

<p>
<q>Rather out of place,</q> she replied.
<q>I feel as if I ought to be
a little intoxicated.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her answer expressed my feeling
exactly. It seemed to me that I
was going <q>on the biggest kind of
a spree.</q>
</p>

<p>
Railroads furnish rapid transit
to suburban retreats where reside
professional and commercial men
whose business is in the city. One
can live in the pleasant little village
of Kingstown, the harbor of Dublin,
six miles from the city, and
reach Dublin in fifteen minutes.
Trains run each way every half-hour.
It has taken me an hour
and a half to come from Eighty-sixth
Street to the City Hall by the street-cars.
This was when we met with
no accidents, and made a good trip.
But New York has the worst locomotive
arrangements of any city in
the world, and immeasurably the
dearest.
</p>

<p>
I had counted upon finding a
great many beggars in Ireland. I
expected, whenever I alighted from
coach or car, to have to run the
gauntlet of a crowd of hungry petitioners.
I was most agreeably
disappointed. During my stay in
Ireland I was asked for charity in
the public streets only once. It
was in Dublin, by a wretched-looking
woman with a sick child.
</p>

<p>
A fine view of Dublin is obtained
from one of the eminences in the
Phœnix Park. It takes in the entire
line of quays. This view has
something of a reduced and smoke-blackened
effect of Paris. The
Phœnix is one of the finest and most
extensive parks in the world. It
covers nearly eighteen hundred
acres. It is true that art has not
done much for it, but nature has
done a great deal. It possesses
some of the most beautiful characteristics
of English park scenery&mdash;beautiful
green lawns, dotted with
clumps of trees. Large herds of deer
course swiftly over the uplands, or
stop in groups, half frightened, to
reconnoitre, in a coy side-glance,
the intruder into their domain.
Charming rides, drives, and walks
invite the dwellers in the city to
pure air and healthful exercise. A
portion of the park is railed off
into a <q>People's Garden,</q> where
poor as well as rich have free ingress,
and can gladden their town-weary
eyes with the sight of growing
shrubs and budding flowers,
and graceful water-fowl sailing on
the pretty meres. A lofty monument
to the Duke of Wellington&mdash;not
possessed of any artistic grace,
<pb n='533'/><anchor id='Pg533'/>
however&mdash;crowns one of the knolls.
On the right of the main avenue
is the Viceregal Lodge. Near it is
the column, mounted by a phœnix,
erected by the celebrated Lord
Chesterfield, who first caused the
park to be thrown open to the people.
The English Government
never sent to Ireland a viceroy
who had less prejudices against the
people he was sent to govern.
Somewhere in his celebrated letters
he speaks of <q>his friends the Irish,</q>
and says: <q>They always liked me,
and I liked them.</q> The Viceregal
Lodge, with its dependent buildings,
is a delightful summer retreat. I
do not wonder that the viceroy
should be glad to see the return of
spring, that he might get away from
the poor locality in which the castle
is situated. The Hibernian
school for soldiers' children is situated
at the lower extremity of the
park.
</p>

<p>
The Zoölogical Gardens are not
far from the King's Bridge entrance.
The collection is a fair one, but the
damp climate does not agree with
the animals, and they have the same
woe-begone appearance as their fellow-sufferers
in the Regent's Park.
The elephants have a faded, mildewed
appearance. The furred
animals are suggestive of worn-out
hair trunks. In neither the Dublin
nor the London Gardens do they
look so bright and sleek as, under
the brighter sky and more genial
atmosphere of Paris, in the Jardin
des Plantes and the Jardin d'Acclimatation.
The collection of
lions is good. Among them is a
noble leo which the keeper informed
us was born in the gardens.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, he is an Irish lion!</q>
said one of our party, hazarding a
gentle joke. There was no response
from the keeper. Not the
merest ripple of a smile. Decidedly,
the Irish in Ireland are becoming
a serious people.
</p>

<p>
Between the Under Secretary's
Lodge and the Hibernian School is
the historical tract known as <q>The
Fifteen Acres.</q> It was a celebrated
duelling-ground in the old days,
when a <q>crooked look</q> was followed
by an invitation to pistols
and coffee. There it was that <q>the
Queen's Bench went out with the
Common Pleas,</q> and the <q>Chancery
winged the Exchequer.</q> It
was there that Daniel O'Connell
met Mr. d'Esterre, and killed him.
Beyond the park lie the famous
<q>Strawberry Beds,</q> where the
Dubliners crowd, in the season, to
enjoy their <q>sweet strawberries
smothered in cream.</q>
</p>

<p>
An omnibus plies regularly between
the city and the Botanical
Gardens at Glasnevin; but it is better
to take a four-wheeler, and suit
your own time and convenience.
Make your bargain with Jehu before
you start, however. The gardens
are about thirty acres in extent.
The cemetery where lie the
ashes of the great orators, Curran
and O'Connell, is at Glasnevin.
The monument to O'Connell is an
imitation of that puzzle to antiquarians&mdash;the
Irish Round Tower.
The effect of the monument is not
good. It seemed to me grotesque
and out of place. I could not at
first explain to myself why it produced
such a harsh, unpleasing effect.
A glance at the veritable
Tower of Clondalkin enlightened
me. The mock tower wants the
mellowing touch of artist-centuries
to soften down its hard, new outlines,
and make it seem in keeping
with the repose that reigns in the
City of the Dead.
</p>

<p>
A pilgrimage to the birthplace
of Thomas Moore was a labor of
love which we promised ourselves
<pb n='534'/><anchor id='Pg534'/>
would be among the first performed
after reaching Dublin. We learned
that the spot where the bard
first saw the light was in Anngiers
Street, generally pronounced by
the Dubliners <hi rend='italic'>Aingers</hi> Street.
Everybody we asked professed to
know all about it, yet nobody could
tell us the number of the house.
Anngiers Street is not a very long
street. We concluded to go through
it from end to end, and at either
side, examining every house in detail.
Anngiers Street commences
at Stephen Street, in rear of the
castle, and extends to Bishop Street.
It is not a particularly clean street.
It is only just to say, however, that
it is no dirtier than continental,
transatlantic, or Britannic streets
of like degree. We began our pilgrimage
at the wrong end, but our
patient search was at length rewarded.
The house is No. 12, at
the corner of Anngiers Street and
Little Longford Street. It was
then occupied by <q>Thomas Healy,
Wine and Spirit Merchant.</q> According
to some of little Tom's
biographers, the old house has always
been devoted to the sale of
intoxicating beverages. His father
was what Uncle Sam calls by the
undignified name of <q>rumseller.</q>
But <q>honor and shame from no condition
rise,</q> and Tom's muse may
owe her seductive, anacreontic
blush to his early associations.
</p>

<p>
A weather-soiled and smoke-blackened
bust of the poet occupies
a niche between the windows
of the second story. The house
has been recently painted and renovated.
When these repairs were
commenced, the bust was removed
by the proprietor, and was not replaced
at their completion. The
worthy vender of wine and spirits
who occupied the house, though he
believed in filling bumpers fair, and
their power of smoothing the brow
of Care, was probably rather bored
by the continual visits of votaries
to the shrine of the poet. The
sacrifices of these pilgrims to the
rosy muse were most probably merely
theoretical. They did not <q>send
round the wine,</q> or order any of it
sent to their address in the city.
They took none of those <q>brimming
glasses</q> generative of <q>wit's
electric flame.</q> A plague on such
pilgrims! say I, marry and amen!
The bust of the bard shall no longer
be a beacon for them. But the
statesmen and critics who sit at the
base of Nelson's Pillar soon noticed
that the niche was empty. Their
poetical ire was raised to an unpleasant
degree. They brought
such influences to bear on the proprietor
of the Cradle of Genius that
the bust was at once restored to its
accustomed niche.
</p>

<p>
The Dubliners have a passion for
flowers and rock-work. Every
available foot of ground in front
and in rear of their houses is devoted
to the cultivation of flowers
and the building of miniature grottos.
The city is spreading very
fast, and rows of cottages are building
in the suburbs on all sides. In
general, the houses are not what we
Americans would call comfortable.
The fire-places are very small; for
coal is scarce and dear, and a bundle
of kindling-wood, composed of
half a dozen chips not much larger
than matches, is an object of purchase.
The grates seem constructed
to throw out smoke instead of
heat. In this they are well seconded
by the moist, heavy atmosphere.
Living is good and cheap, however&mdash;about
one-fourth cheaper than it is
in our principal cities on this side
of the Atlantic. Liquors are good
in quality and moderate in price.
Clothing of all kinds costs two-thirds
<pb n='535'/><anchor id='Pg535'/>
less than in New York, and
is not <q>shoddy.</q> The English
custom of wearing flowers in the
button-hole prevails in Dublin.
The commerce in flowers is therefore
extensive, and the shops devoted
to that charming traffic make
delightful displays of floral treasures.
The Irish fruit, however,
with the exception of strawberries,
gooseberries, and currants, is inferior
to ours. American apples are for
sale at all fruiterers', at prices very
little greater than those of New
York.
</p>

<p>
Carving in <q>bog-oak</q> is quite
an important trade in Dublin. Indeed,
it may much more probably
be called an art. I have seen some
very artistic specimens of bog-wood
ornaments&mdash;statuettes, groups, etc.
Ladies' chains, brooches, and bracelets
of Irish bog-oak were very
fashionable a year or two since.
The fashion extended even to
London and Paris.
</p>

<p>
The Dublin streets are dull at
night. The quality of gas supplied
the city is poor. Early closing is
pretty general, and all the principal
stores are closed at dark. Doubtless
this is better for the clerks and
shopmen, and more economical for
their employers. But it is not so
pleasant for that large class of the
community who love to saunter
along the lighted streets in the
evening, and feast their eyes on the
treasures in the illuminated shop-windows.
There is little to tempt
the tourist into the Dublin streets
at night. I should advise him&mdash;or
particularly <emph>her</emph>&mdash;to avoid promenading
on Saturday evening. I
regret to say that evening is very
generally observed by handicrafts-men
and laborers, and even by
shopmen and clerks, as a Bacchanalian
festival. The number
of persons who sacrifice to the rosy
god at the week's end is lamentably
great. Monday is a workmen's
holiday, and it is very hard to get
mechanics to work on that day.
</p>

<p>
The unsavory localities of Dublin
are designated by strange
names. Here are a few by way of
example: Bow Lane, near the
Insane Hospital founded by Dean
Swift, who, as he says or sings,

<head>Relatio Itineris In Marylandiam.</head>

<p>
Narrative of a Voyage to Maryland. 1633.
</p>

<p>
By F. Andrew White, S.J.
</p>

<p>
The most beautiful chapter in
the colonial history of North America
is that setting forth the colonization
of fair Maryland, <hi rend='italic'>Terra Mariæ</hi>,
or, as she was pre-eminently
called, the <hi rend='italic'>Land of the Sanctuary</hi>.
And yet this is, strange to say, one
of the least read and least known
of the chapters of our early history.
Every American knows all
about the Puritan Pilgrim Fathers,
and the <hi rend='italic'>Mayflower</hi>, and Plymouth
Rock, and all the facts and fictions
concerning the settlement of New
England. Most Americans devoutly
believe, upon the authority
of New England orators and historians,
that the Pilgrim Fathers aforesaid
were the founders of the civil
and religious liberty now organized
in this great republic, mistaking a
strife for sectarian ascendency and
domination for a contest for the
great principles of religious liberty.
In point of fact, the Puritan Pilgrims
held in intense horror the
very principles now so generously
assigned to them. They wanted,
not equality, but supremacy. It
was only in Catholic Maryland that
religious equality was truly established,
both by the design of the
Catholic proprietary, Lord Baltimore,
and by the legislative enactments
of the freemen of the province,
who cordially invited all persons
persecuted for their religious
belief to find not only a refuge in
Maryland, but all the rights and
privileges, civil and religious, enjoyed
by themselves, the founders
of the colony.
</p>

<p>
Here, and here only, then, do we
see the first rays of true civil and
religious liberty in the American
colonies&mdash;a glimmer of light in old
S. Mary's like Portia's candle:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'><hi rend='italic'>Portia</hi>&mdash;That light we see is burning in my hall.</q></l>
<l>How far that little candle throws his beams!</l>
<l><q rend='post'>So shines a good deed in a naughty world.</q></l>
</lg>

</quote>

<p>
If now, indeed, the greater glory
dims the less, we must not forget
the light of the candle in the then
surrounding darkness.
</p>

<p>
Everything connected with the
early history of Maryland is, and
ought to be, deeply interesting to
every American of liberal culture
or sentiment. We are pleased to
see that the Maryland Historical
Society is making earnest efforts to
gather and save all the fragmentary
lore pertaining thereto. The volume
we now have in hand bears
evidence of the fact. We give the
title-page in full, as a summary of
its substance:

<q>Narrative of a Voyage to Maryland.
By F. Andrew White, S.J.
An Account of the Colony of the
Lord Baron of Baltimore. Extracts
from different letters of missionaries,
<pb n='538'/><anchor id='Pg538'/>
from the year 1635 to the
year 1677. Edited by the Rev. E.
A. Dalrymple, S.T.D. Baltimore,
February, 1874. Baltimore: John
Murphy &amp; Co. (Printers to the
Maryland Historical Society).</q>
</p>

<p>
The Historical Society gives us
a neat octavo volume of nearly 200
pages, issued in a style that would
do credit to any publishing house
in America, or, for that matter, in
Europe either.
</p>

<p>
The learned editor, Dr. Dalrymple,
tells us in the preface where
and how these valuable documents
were obtained: <q>About the year
1832 the Rev. William McSherry,
S.J., discovered, in the archives of
the <q>Domus Professa</q> of the Society
in Rome, the originals of the MSS.
which are named on the title-page.
He carefully copied these MSS.,
and placed the copies in the library
of Georgetown College, D. C., of
which institution (being at the same
time the provincial of the society
in Maryland) he afterwards became
the honored president.</q>
</p>

<p>
Translations were made and
printed of these manuscripts; but,
copies being nearly exhausted, the
Historical Society determined to
make a new issue, accompanying
the new translation with the Latin
text, as far as that could be obtained,
some pages of the original transcripts
being unfortunately lost.
The present volume is of the new
issue, and it is little to say that its
contents are intensely interesting.
</p>

<p>
It is quite charming to follow
good F. White, missionary, saint,
scholar, <q>vir non minus sanctitate
vitæ, quam doctrina conspicuus,</q>
in his humble and earnest and
successful labors among the savage
aborigines of Maryland. His great
soul was given up to his holy mission.
We follow the little fleet,
the <hi rend='italic'>Ark</hi> and the <hi rend='italic'>Dove</hi> (what beautiful
and significant names&mdash;the
<hi rend='italic'>ark</hi> of Noah, and the <hi rend='italic'>dove</hi> sent
forth by the patriarch!), over the
waste of waters, where they had not
only the dangers of the sea, but
<hi rend='italic'>Turks and pirates</hi>, to dread, even
from the British Channel onward
over the whole <hi rend='italic'>Virginian</hi> Ocean.
</p>

<p>
On the 25th of March, <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> 1634,
the pious missionaries celebrated,
as they believed, the first Mass ever
said in Maryland. But it seems
that some of their own order had
preceded them on this field; for as
early as 1570 F. Segura and other
Spanish Jesuits from Florida were
endeavoring to bring the Indian
tribes on the shores of the Chesapeake
into the Christian fold, when
they were ruthlessly murdered before
the rustic altar on which they
had daily offered the Holy Sacrifice
for the traitors who slew them
(<hi rend='italic'>Woodstock Letters</hi>).
</p>

<p>
The colonists in S. Mary's soon
made friendly relations with the
Indians, and the missionaries had
the inexpressible happiness of
bringing many over to the true
faith. The fathers would often-times
leave the dwellings of the
whites to abide entirely with the
Indians, though the governor
disapproved of remote excursions,
on account of the treachery of
hostile tribes, who were always
hovering around the borders. The
fathers, moreover, had no light
duties in attending to the spiritual
wants of the colonists themselves,
who were largely, but by no means
exclusively, good Catholics.
</p>

<p>
In those primitive days, when all
the freemen of the province met in
general assembly for the purposes
of legislation, F. White and his
colleagues were summoned to take
part in the sessions; but they declined
the honor, and, as <q>they
earnestly requested to be excused
<pb n='539'/><anchor id='Pg539'/>
from taking part in the secular
concerns of the colony, their request
was granted.</q> They could
do <emph>their work</emph> more effectively, <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ad
majorem Dei gloriam</foreign>, in the rude
Indian wigwam where they had
established an altar, than in the
hall of the legislative assembly.
</p>

<p>
Lord Baltimore obtained lands
from the Indians by purchase, and
not by conquest, and colonists and
Indians and missionaries were
usually upon the most friendly
terms together. The Indians
treated the strangers to their dishes,
to <foreign rend='italic'>pone</foreign> and <foreign rend='italic'>omini</foreign>, and roasting ears,
and game, and fish, and oysters;
and, in return, during a season of
famine, the Indians were supplied
from the not over-abundant stores
of the colonists. The natives then
were not inclined to strong potations:
<q>They are especially careful
to refrain from wine and warm
drinks, and are not easily persuaded
to taste them, except some whom
the English have corrupted with
their own vices.</q> Alas! from that
day to this how many untold
thousands of the children of the
forest have been sent, body and
soul, to perdition by the infusion
and diffusion among them of
English vices!
</p>

<p>
The missionaries give accounts
of their labors with a <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>naïveté</foreign> that is
charming. We can see them starting
on the broad river in a little
boat&mdash;a father, an interpreter, and
a servant-man of all work, with
their supplies of bread and cheese,
and dried corn and beans, with a
bottle of wine for religious purposes,
a casket with the sacred utensils,
and a table as an altar for performing
sacrifice, and another casket
with trifles for the Indians&mdash;bells,
combs, fishing-hooks, needles and
thread, and other such commodities.
They take a tent to cover them
when beyond the reach of English
residents, and, after a weary day's
work, they lie down by the open
fire to take their rest. <q>If fear of
rain threatens, we erect our hut, and
cover it with a larger mat spread
over; nor, praise be to God, do we
enjoy this humble fare and hard
couch with a less joyful mind than
more luxurious provisions in Europe.</q>
In fact, they are so happy
in their work that they think God
gives them already a foretaste of
the blessed life of the future.
</p>

<p>
Upon one of these excursions a
friendly Indian was pursued by
enemies and transfixed with a
spear; they <q>pierced him through
from the right side to the left, at
a hand's breath below the arm-pit,
near the heart itself, with a wound
two fingers broad at each side.</q>
Some of the man's friends were
converts, and they called in F.
White to prepare him for death.
The missionary gave him suitable
instructions, taught him short prayers,
and received him into the
church, and, touching his wounds
with relics of the most holy cross,
took his leave, directing the bystanders,
when he should breath his
last, to take him to the chapel for the
purpose of burial. The next day
this same Indian, with a companion,
followed the father in a boat,
showed him the red spots where
the wounds were of the previous
day, exclaiming <q>that he is entirely
well, nor from the hour at which
the father had left yesterday had
he ceased to invoke the most holy
name of Jesus, to whom he attributed
his recovered health.</q>
</p>

<p>
The people of the lower counties
of Maryland have always had a
reputation for culture, refinement,
and good manners. They appear
to have these traits by inheritance.
<q>The Catholics who live in the

<p>
We find we are extending what
was intended for a brief notice into
a regular article, for which the reader
may or not thank us; an abiding
and essential interest in the
cause must be our apology. We
will say but little more, though
the theme admits of vast expansion.

<p>
In Lord Baltimore's <hi rend='italic'>Declaratio</hi>, or
account of the colony&mdash;which, by
the way, is very much <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>couleur de
rose</foreign> (<q>It is sad to contrast the
glowing accounts of Maryland in
the <hi rend='italic'>Declaratio</hi> and the painful experience
of the missionaries,</q> says
the editor with great justice)&mdash;we
find him inviting his countrymen
to go to his colony, not only
to better their material interests,
but also to spread the seeds of religion
and piety&mdash;a work, he says,
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>dignum angelis, dignum Anglis</foreign>. This
recalls to mind the happy witticism
of the great pontiff who sent Augustine
to perform the same work with
the English themselves.
</p>

<p>
There is scarcely a page of this
new issue of the <hi rend='italic'>Relatio</hi>, and the
accompanying letters, that does not
invite special interest. Surely
those missionaries were men of
God, living and dying to serve him
only. <q>I would rather,</q> writes
F. Brock, laboring in the conversion
of these Indians, <q>expire on the
bare ground, deprived of all human
succor, and perishing with hunger,
than once think of abandoning this
holy work of God from fear of
want.</q> Within a few weeks after
writing that letter, worn out with
privations, he went to rest from his
labors.
</p>

<p>
Good F. White, seized by Claiborne's
rebel soldiers, was sent in
irons to England, where he died
like a saint, as he had lived. <q>His
self-denial, privations, and sufferings,</q>
says Dr. Dalrymple, himself
a Protestant minister, <q>and the
touching patience and cheerfulness
with which they were all endured,
move our profound respect and
admiration. F. White deserves a
high place of honor amongst the
many heroic missionaries of the
Society of Jesus.</q> What wonderful
men they were indeed, the old
Jesuit missionaries! We of the
present day could scarcely believe
their lives possible but for the
F. De Smets and kindred spirits
who repeat them even in our own
day. <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Laudamus viros gloriosos....

<p>
We may repeat that the Maryland
Historical Society has done
a good work in bringing out this
volume anew; and its agents, editor,
translator, and publisher have
all done their work in the most
creditable manner. We observed
in the translation, excellent as it is,
some few points open to criticism;
as, <hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>, p. 10, <q><hi rend='italic'>To the Very Rev. Father,
General Mutius Vitelleschi</hi>.</q>
The comma is misplaced between
father and general. On p. 11 it
is said, speaking of S. Clement,
<q>who, because he had been tied to
an anchor and thrown into the sea,
obtained the crown of martyrdom.</q>
A man is not a martyr because of
his execution in any fashion, but
because of the principles for which
he suffers. We find, on p. 12, the
word <hi rend='italic'>Sabbatum</hi> rendered <hi rend='italic'>Sabbath</hi>,
instead of <hi rend='italic'>Saturday</hi>, which would
convey the true idea in this case.
<pb n='541'/><anchor id='Pg541'/>
There may be some other slight inaccuracies
of the same or a similar
kind, but, upon the whole, they are
unimportant, and the translation is
a fair and creditable rendering of
the text.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we would say that if the
reader would wish to spend a few
hours, safely, profitably, and pleasantly
in field and camp, with true
soldiers of the cross, let him obtain
and read the <hi rend='italic'>Relatio Itineris</hi>,
with the accompanying documents.

<p>
By the time we had been a fortnight
at R&mdash;&mdash; R&mdash;&mdash;, the sentiment
of the <foreign rend='italic'>dolce far niente</foreign><note place='foot'>The pleasure of doing nothing.</note> of
the Italians seemed gradually to
take possession of Mary and myself.
I sketched a little, and Mary
sat in the <foreign rend='italic'>loggia</foreign>, reading occasionally,
and dreaming a great deal.
Frank was still absent; having, in
the most unjustifiable way, undertaken
a complete tour in the Abruzzi,
accompanied by his friend,
Don Emidio Gandolfi, who had
given him rendezvous at Monte
Casino. One day, however, when
I came home from a delightful ramble
all over the gardens of the Villa
<q>Mon Caprice,</q> Mary greeted me
with the exclamation:
</p>

<p>
<q>Frank will arrive the day after
to-morrow, and Don Emidio is coming
with him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I thought it had been settled
Don Emidio was to go back to
Rome.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Settled by whom, my dear
Jane? I conclude he has changed
his plans.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well! I know how it will be:
we shall have none of Frank's society;
he will for ever be making excursions
with Don Emidio where
we cannot go.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Their distant excursions are
over; and we want them for all the
places we have to visit near Naples.
Up to now we have been so taken
up with the Vernons that I have
not cared for much more than the
walk backwards and forwards to
their house and our own. But we
have a great deal to see, and I am
longing to begin.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! Don Emidio has seen it
already a dozen times. It would
only bore him to go over it again.</q>
</p>

<p>
I cannot conceive what made me
say this to Mary. I think I was
cross. I know I was tired and hot
with my walk. She made no answer
for a few seconds; but I felt
she was looking at me. And so I
did that stupid thing which one
always hates doing and cannot the
least prevent&mdash;I blushed. Having
thus made myself look like a fool,
I glanced at Mary, and our eyes
met.
</p>

<pb n='542'/><anchor id='Pg542'/>

<p>
<q>Do you dislike Don Emidio,
Jane, that you speak in that way?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Dear me! no, not at all. I only
did not suppose he would care to
go over all the old places again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is not always the places; it
is sometimes the company that is
the chief attraction.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! yes; I know Don Emidio
is devoted to Frank.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think he likes us all, Jane.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No one can help liking you,
Mary; and I dare say he does not
<emph>dis</emph>like me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is that all you think about it,
my dear?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course it is. What more is
there to think about it?</q> And then,
as I knew I was blushing again, I
went out of the room to take off
my hat. But I did not care to go
back to Mary directly, for fear she
should say anything more to make
me cross. So I ran down to Villa
Casinelli to have a chat with the
Vernons. I found them all in a
state of very great excitement. Ida
was looking anxious, her eyes glistening
like diamonds, and a bright,
hectic spot on each cheek&mdash;which
I never like to see, knowing how
delicate she is. Elizabeth, who is
always calm and gentle, and rather
slow in speaking and moving, was
sitting opposite Ida, with her large,
dark velvet eyes full of tears. As
I entered, Ida started up, exclaiming:
</p>

<p>
<q>O Jane! what do you think
those dreadful Casinelli have done
now? This morning, before anybody
was up, they cut down the
chapel bell, which was hung outside
the door on our floor, near the servants'
rooms, so that Lucia might
ring it every morning. And now,
to-day, a feast-day, on which the
congregation was sure to be numerous,
when Lucia went to ring the
bell for the first time (you know we
always ring it thrice), she found
that the rope was left dangling,
but no bell. After hunting about
everywhere, one of the Camerota,
the father of your Paolino, found it
tied to a fig-tree on the terrace
just above the chapel. The <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>contadini</foreign><note place='foot'>Peasants.</note>
are in a wild state of indignation,
and I really am at a loss
to imagine what will happen next;
for what with the insult to religion,
the annoyance to Padre Cataldo,
and the constant anxiety to ourselves,
I begin to think we shall
have to throw it all up, and leave
this place.</q>
</p>

<p>
I had already heard a great deal
about the Casinelli and their extraordinary
conduct. Indeed, ever
since we had been near neighbors
to the Vernons, the ins and outs
of this intricate and truly Italian
intrigue had formed one of the
chief themes of our daily conversations.
But to enable my readers to
follow the plots and stratagems of
this Macchiavelian family, I must
give an account of the whole group.
My story will represent a state of
things not, I imagine, to be found
anywhere out of Italy. Every
nation has its characteristics, its
qualities, and their corresponding
defects. The peculiar <foreign rend='italic'>finesse</foreign> and
acuteness of the Italians make
them the best constructors of a
plot that imagination can conceive,
and give them a proportionate
facility for carrying it on and
working it out. They are natural
born actors. And they can so
identify themselves with the character
they wish to assume that not
only is it exceedingly difficult for
the most diligent observer to detect
the false from the true, but I doubt
if even they themselves do not end
in interiorly confusing the two so
<pb n='543'/><anchor id='Pg543'/>
absolutely as to efface all moral
lines of demarcation. They can
make themselves a false conscience
on a gigantic scale, and end in
themselves believing the lies they
have invented.
</p>

<p>
The Casinelli are a numerous
family, consisting of seven daughters
and two sons, all equally endowed
with the faculty, of assuming
a part, not for days or weeks, but
for years or for a whole life. The
one fixed and determinate object
of the nine persons is, as is usual
with Italians, to make money. To
obtain wealth, and always more
wealth, all means seem lawful to
them, and no stratagem too low.
The house, garden, and vineyards
of Casinelli make altogether a nice
and profitable little property, and,
of course, it belongs to them all&mdash;that
is, each has a share in it. They
have wisely agreed that more will
be gained by their all holding together,
as regards the property,
than by any division, especially as
it is but small. They reserve a few
rooms on the ground floor of the
house for their own use, though their
residence is principally in Naples.
The other two sets of apartments
in the house they let to strangers.
But in order to make sure of all the
fish that may come to the net, the
elder brother is stated to be the
owner of one of the suites of rooms,
and one of the sisters of the other.
The sister professes to be a very
dragon of virtue, and will receive
no tenants who do not bear an
unspotted reputation, and who cannot
also give evidence of a more
than merely respectable position
of life&mdash;they must be well, and even
highly, connected. The brother, on
the contrary, is quite ready to part
with his rooms to anybody who
pays his rent. <q>What does he
care about who they are, or what
they do, so long as he gets his
money?</q> And in the case of the
honest man happening to have a
preference for the brother's rooms,
while the gay Lothario has set his
heart on the spinster's domain, ho!
<foreign rend='italic'>presto</foreign>, the proprietorship is quickly
changed; the brother owns the
sister's side of the house, while the
sister is the fair possessor of the
brother's portion. If you are so
ill advised as to look dubious and
express an impression that it had
been otherwise, you are met with a
calm, indulgent smile at your evident
deficiency of intelligence:
<q>Dear me! no. Were you not aware
it was nothing of the kind? Some
repairs necessary to be made in my
brother's rooms had led to his holding
mine for a time. He wanted
them for a friend of his. I regretted
the fact; but I was not acquainted
with the character of the
tenant when I conceded my rooms
to my brother, because I was myself
called from home</q> (or some such
reason), <q>and was unable to attend
to the letting. I deeply regretted
the fact; but it was done without
my knowledge.</q> And thus they
turn about; always contriving to
run with the hare, and hunt with
the hounds. As a rule, it is the
sister who comes forward and acts
as <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>padrona</foreign><note place='foot'>Mistress.</note> when the parties
wishing to hire either set of rooms
are evidently respectable. If they
are the reverse, the rooms are let
nevertheless, but then it is the
brother who meets the storm. And
thus they enact the little man and
woman who come out of the clock:
the lady in fair weather, the gentleman
in great-coat and umbrella
when it is wet.
</p>

<p>
I am not aware of what the Casinelli
family motto is; but it ought
<pb n='544'/><anchor id='Pg544'/>
to be, <q>Divide and govern.</q> For
they adopt the same double-surface
process as regards politics. One
brother is a staunch Bourbonist,
the other a fervent Liberal. In
public each bewails the opinions
of the other. And thus, between
the two, they catch the favor of
both parties, and divide the spoils
between them. If circumstances
call for extreme measures in order
to gain some end in view, the
whole family will combine together
to fall upon one particular member
who, for the time being, represents
some political view at that moment
discredited. Their lamentations
over the one black sheep are long
and loud. Everybody's sympathy
is appealed to; everybody must
lend an ear to the terrible calamity
which has befallen their illustrious
family, inasmuch as one of the race
has been, or is, guilty of&mdash;, whatever
the crime in question may be.
Such grief, such indignation, expressed
on the highest moral
grounds, attracts attention, procures
small favors from compassionating
friends, creates at least an interest,
and adds to their importance and
consideration; while all the time
the black sheep himself is privy to
the whole affair, and receives, in the
secrecy of the domestic circle, his
full share of indemnification for
having stood as whipping-boy for
the rest of the family. He keeps
quiet for a little while, as being
under a cloud. Then presently he
reappears to enjoy the results of
his own condemnation. The elder
brother and sister, who are the
prima donna and tenor of the domestic
comic opera, are always said
to be on bad terms with each
other; not that they are so in reality,
but because, if one has made
a bad bargain or inconveniently offended
anybody, the other can immediately
step forward, pretending
severely to blame the delinquent,
and offering his or her services to
repair the injury, or, in the case of
a bad bargain having been made,
insisting on a readjustment of the
case; not from personal motives,
having, as he or she states, no interest
in the matter, but solely from
a sense of justice. In short, they
<q>hedge</q> in a way that would
make their fortune a thousand
times over at Epsom or Ascot.
No matter what horse loses, they
are sure to have made up their
book in such a way that they must
win something out of whatever happens.
And, meanwhile, the member
of the family who appears to the
outsider to take his part against all
his own kith and kin obtains the
eternal gratitude of the deluded individual,
who is not aware that he
has been assisting at a family intrigue,
based upon his own misfortune,
and intimately and minutely
combined by the whole set of them.
When the Vernons wished to rent
one of the suites of apartments, it
was the elder sister who came forward
with expressions of the warmest
delight. What she had long
desired had been that some family
should reside there who had a
chaplain, and that thus their pretty
little chapel, entirely cut out in the
tufa rock on the sands of the sea-shore,
which rock forms the foundation
of the house, would again
come into use. She was eloquent
in describing how that formerly
that chapel had been so useful to
the numerous <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>vignaiuoli</foreign> and their
families living on and near the
premises. They themselves, she
stated, were no longer rich enough
to afford themselves so great a consolation,
now that the one brother
who had been in the priesthood
was dead. She was quite certain
<pb n='545'/><anchor id='Pg545'/>
that Padre Cataldo was a saint;
and, for her part, no one but the
Vernons should inhabit that part
of the house, for their mere presence
would bring a blessing on all
the rest. She even talked of restoring
whatever was wanting in
the chapel, and doing it up. It had
been sadly neglected, and the cobwebs
hung in festoons from the
rude but effective carving above
the altar on the coved roof and the
walls. The subject of the bas-reliefs
was the Assumption, and,
though roughly done, it had a very
good effect, scrolls and angels'
heads being intermixed with the
principal figures, and the whole
distempered in white picked out
with bright blue. A great deal was
said about the reparations, and the
Vernons, who did not then know
what sort of people they had to
deal with, imagined all that was required
for the use of the chapel
would be found. They soon discovered
their mistake, and, beyond
a little cleaning done, they had to
provide almost everything. As
soon as the Vernons had prepared
it, the eldest Casinelli brought all
her friends to look at it, that they
might admire the piety of her
family, and learn the sacrifices <emph>they</emph>
had made in order to afford this
consolation to the neighborhood!
</p>

<p>
But wisely judging that unforeseen
circumstances might occur
which would show their interests
and the way to make more money
might lie in another direction, the
eldest brother was directed to assume
quite another tone. He was
therefore deputed to act the sceptic
on the occasion, and make supercilious
remarks about his sister's
excess of piety, and the inconvenience
and folly of these extremes
of devotion. He shrugged his
shoulders about it, and lamented
that, not being master, he could do
nothing to refrain her from so rashly
committing herself to possible
expenses, and even to probable difficulties
with the present government,
from the presence of a zealous and
hard-working Jesuit father. At the
same time, he gave no handle
against himself in the matter, but
preserved an outwardly civil manner
towards the Vernons, and a
cold regret towards Padre Cataldo.
As time went on, the Vernons discovered
that there was an ever-increasing
difficulty about all that
was requisite for the altar. The
altar linen was withdrawn, and they
had to find their own. The vestments
were borrowed one day, and
never returned. By the time we
arrived, almost everything for the
service of the altar was the property
of the Vernons; and Ida's active
fingers had achieved the happiest
results from very limited materials.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, there could be no
doubt of the good that was being
done in the neighborhood from the
reopening of the little chapel and
the active piety of Padre Cataldo.
The parish church is a long way off,
and up a very steep hill. The result
is that few of the little children
and women could get to church at
all. There is a chapel, dedicated
to Our Lady of Dolors, by the
roadside at Posilippo, but it is very
small. And there is another built
by the Minutoli when, for love of
the poor, they left their beautiful
villa of <q>Mon Caprice,</q> and raised
an asylum for the aged poor, and a
house to which they themselves retired,
giving away all they could
spare from their own modest requirements.
But this also is somewhat
at a distance; and, moreover,
the population is large, and the accommodation
altogether but scanty.
</p>

<pb n='546'/><anchor id='Pg546'/>

<p>
I have seldom seen more fervor
and devotion than in the little chapel
at Casinelli, hewn out of a rock,
with its simple decorations and a
few natural flowers on the altar.
There was no music, and I cannot
for a moment pretend that there
was the slightest approach to harmony
in the loud, harsh, powerful
shouting which the Italian peasantry
are content to mistake for singing.
But, at least, there was real
devotion, as they sat with eyes fixed
on the preacher, who so beautifully
and so earnestly discoursed to them
as a father might to his children.
I have often seen the tears streaming
down their cheeks; and then
from time to time we would hear
of first this and then that hardened
sinner who came creeping back to
his or her duties, and making us all
glad. Several small boys served at
the altar; and as the honor was
highly prized, they had been made
to come in rotation to obviate
quarrels. One small creature of
about four years of age, and who
had quite the most marvellous eyes
and the longest lashes I ever saw,
was specially pertinacious about his
rights. In short, there was something
touchingly primitive and real
about the whole thing which could
not fail deeply to impress us who
came as strangers into this little
seaside sanctuary. As we sat waiting
for the priest to arrive, or in
the silent parts of the Mass, we
could hear the waves lapping the
yellow sands just outside the half-closed
door. This was the public
entrance; and sometimes, in rough
weather, I think it must have entailed
a little sprinkling of salt water
on the worshippers. We entered
the chapel by a flight of marble
stairs, in a tower which led from
the inner court of the Villa Casinelli,
and which stairs brought us
into an aisle of the chapel, cut further
in the rock, and consequently
always somewhat dark. I remember
Mary's going to Mass before breakfast,
and having desired Paolino to
bring her coffee, and put it in one
of the niches of the marble staircase;
which he did, greatly amused
and pleased at so unusual a proceeding.
It was never, however, repeated,
for the wind blew fresh and
cold, and the Vernons were almost
hurt at what might look like a mistrust
of their ever-ready and abundant
hospitality.
</p>

<p>
There was altogether something
about the arrangement and position
of the chapel so unlike the
beaten ways of everyday life that,
united as it is with the memory of
the beautiful short addresses of
the father and the devotion of the
people, it remains in our minds
heightened by a tinge of romance.
And now there was the fatal apprehension
that all this was to be destroyed.
</p>

<p>
It was some little time before
Mary and I could quite make
out what this suddenly-developed
though long smouldering hostility
to Padre Cataldo and the Vernons
could mean, the Casinelli had appeared
so anxious to be civil to the
latter, and had professed such delight
at first that the chapel should
be reopened. At length we learnt
the facts of the case, which were as
follows: The Vernons had been
residing at Casinelli for about two
years, and doing a great deal of
good in their immediate neighborhood,
when an Italian gentleman,
a strong Liberal, and openly professing
infidelity, applied for the
set of apartments corresponding to
those occupied by the Vernons.
In this case it was the brother who
appeared as the owner, and who,
careless of all save his rent, let it at
<pb n='547'/><anchor id='Pg547'/>
once to the Martorelli, as we will
call the gentleman in question and
the lady who accompanied him.
</p>

<p>
This, of course, was a grand opportunity
for the sister to come
forward in the family comedy, and
enact her part. So with loud bewailings
and great disturbance of
the whole household, she took to
her bed, and sent for all her acquaintances
to come and bewail
with her the wickedness of her
brother, who had let the apartments
to such people&mdash;not even respectable!&mdash;and
so brought a slur on his
father's house. Everybody was entreated
to pray that the brother's
hard heart might be touched and
his conversion effected.
</p>

<p>
But, in the meanwhile, nothing
was done by any member of the
family to prevent the Martorelli
from taking quiet possession, as
tenants, of a property which belongs
to all the Casinelli, and about the
letting of which, therefore, every
one had a voice. This case was so
glaring a one, and was so likely to
bring the Casinelli into disrepute,
that it was found necessary to drill
all the members of the family to
act the part of outraged propriety.
Therefore all the seven sisters refused
acquaintance with the new-comers,
while they redoubled their
attentions to the Vernons, wearying
them with reiterated invectives
against the Martorelli, and ostentatiously
going the whole round
of the garden, rather than run the
risk of meeting them in the avenue
which leads to the principal entrance.
</p>

<p>
Six months elapsed, and during
that time the brother was a constant
guest at the Martorelli's,
while more and more he evinced
a marked absence of civility towards
the Vernons, and especially
towards Padre Cataldo. On one
occasion, as the brother returned
from dining with the Martorelli,
he said something positively insulting
to the Vernons, whom he met
in the garden. This was overheard
by some of <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>vignaiuoli</foreign>,<note place='foot'>The keepers of the vineyards.</note> and was repeated
to the seven sisters, who
accordingly went in a body, the
next day, to call on the Vernons,
with redoubled regrets about their
brother and about the vicinity of
such objectionable people as the
Martorelli, who, however, they rejoiced
to add, would certainly
vacate the apartment in another
month. The Vernons, knowing no
reason to doubt their statement,
were naturally gratified to hear it,
as the garden belonged equally to
all the inhabitants of the house, except
a very small portion assigned
to each family, only sufficient for
the cultivation of a few flowers.
Time, however, wore on, and another
six months had expired without
making any difference as regarded
the presence of the Martorelli.
</p>

<p>
Far from showing any signs of
intended departure, Signor Martorelli
was allowed to undertake several
improvements in the house
and garden at his own expense.
About the same time some of the
sisters called on Padre Cataldo,
and, without making any allusion
to the works that were being carried
on by their tenant, they informed
him, with every demonstration
of zeal, that the lady who resided
in the house with him had
shown some signs of a better state
of feeling than the gentleman; and
that, in short, she was a very interesting
person&mdash;one about whose welfare
they could not but feel anxious.
They added that, when she saw
people going to and from the chapel,
she was noticed to sigh deeply,
<pb n='548'/><anchor id='Pg548'/>
and had actually expressed surprise
that no one had ever invited her to
enter the chapel; while, on the
other hand, their brother was always
taunting them with a want of
real charity in having avoided any
intercourse with this perhaps repentant
sister. They had therefore,
they asserted, after many misgivings,
come in a body to consult his
reverence as to what he would advise
them to do. Personally, they
could have no wish to know such
people; but here, possibly, was a
question of the salvation of a soul,
and all selfish sentiments must be
laid aside for that. Perhaps <emph>their</emph>
knowing her might do good; did
his reverence not think that, with
such an end in view, they ought
to sacrifice their natural aversion,
and call on the interesting lady?
Of course the only reply that a
priest could make to such a question
was that no consideration
should stand in the way when any
hope of doing good is in question.
And then all the seven damsels,
breaking forth in expressions of
submission to his advice, and appearing
to take it as if the initiative
had come from him, with pious
phrases and low courtesies, left his
reverence's presence. From that
day the greatest intimacy and constant
intercourse sprang up between
the two families. The seven sisters
and the young lady were inseparable.
Signor Martorelli's sentiments
and principles were deeply bewailed;
but if her husband, as he is called,
and as we hope he is, showed so
little religion, at least she was a
promising subject; and whenever
they saw the Vernons, it was always
to relate the growing success of their
happy manœuvre. Time, however,
sped on his way, and no practical
results followed. Signora Martorelli
entered no church, while the
man threw off the mask, and openly
began to do the devil's work among
the pious <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>contadini</foreign><note place='foot'>Peasantry.</note> of the place.
He would send for two or three of
the young lads at the hour of Mass
on Sundays and feast days, and
promise them a trifling sum, if, instead
of going to church, they would
execute some commission for him.
When they hesitated, he would
laugh at their scruples, and ridicule
their attachment to the Jesuit father,
and their caring to have objects
of devotion like a rosary or
the picture of a saint. By degrees
his discourses to them became impregnated
with positive blasphemy;
he grew bolder in his expressions
of hatred against religion, and more
virulent in his attacks on the ministers
of the church. At length he
had messages conveyed to the Vernons,
to the effect that the bell for
Mass (which was never rung before
8 o'clock) was an intolerable nuisance
to him; and he threw out
hints of revenge if it was not discontinued.
Whenever it was rung,
suddenly furious sounds proceeded
from his part of the house. And
really it would seem as if the
wretched man were seized with the
rage of the possessed, and that,
when that bell sounded, the devil
entered into him. The Vernons'
servants became the objects of mysterious
threats and of vile calumnies.
A wretched peasant was
bribed to frighten one of them at
night; and a more daring sinner,
but who afterwards repented with
tears, was induced, by promises of
money, to fire at Padre Cataldo
one evening as he was entering the
avenue where the man stood concealed.
</p>

<p>
At length the climax was reached
which I have related at the
<pb n='549'/><anchor id='Pg549'/>
beginning of this chapter, and the
Mass bell was cut down in the
night, and hung upon a fig-tree. I
remained a long time with Ida and
Elizabeth, discussing what would
be the best course to pursue; and
as I have got so far in the history
of the Mass bell, I think I had
better carry it on to the end, though
it will lead me beyond many of the
other incidents of our stay at Posilippo.
It was decided that Ida
should write very civilly but very
firmly to the elder sister, remonstrating
at the bell being removed.
The sisters rose up in a body, and
all together intoned a loud lamentation
over the wickedness of the
world. It was their desire the bell
should be replaced, and that in all
things the reverend father should
do whatever he thought proper. It
was impossible to say who had removed
the bell; no one could so
much as guess who could be at the
bottom of so much wickedness;
but as it was quite overwhelming,
the eldest sister, true to her traditions
and habits, retired to bed,
informed her friends of the circumstance,
and gathered them
round her couch for two days of
sympathy and condolence. The
bell was, of course, replaced by
the still trusting Vernons; but the
atheistic Martorelli only escaped
condign punishment at the hands
of the indignant <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>contadini</foreign> through
the remonstrances and commands
of Padre Cataldo, who, in this instance,
had unusual difficulty in
getting his orders obeyed, and in
preventing the insults that had
been heaped upon him from being
revenged by his loving but hot-headed
Italian penitents.
</p>

<p>
The next Sunday morning Mary
and I, who had far less faith in the
possibility of any sincerity in the
Casinelli than even the Vernons,
listened anxiously for the first
sound of the Mass bell. My watch
was, I suppose, in advance of the
right time; for it was five minutes
past eight, and I had not heard a
sound, when Mary came running in
with the joyful exclamation that it
was all right, and that the bell was
pealing loud. The good Posilippians
looked out of their cavernous
houses, and peeped from their windows;
and as we stood at our garden
door, we could hear them calling to
each other just as Mary had done
to me&mdash;that the bad man had not
dared again to cut down the bell in
the night.
</p>

<p>
It was not long, however, before
Martorelli, whose rage knew no
bounds, began to express his
threats against the Vernons, and
especially against their chaplain,
too loudly to escape notice. The
father himself was well aware of
these threats, because they never
failed to be repeated by the people
about the place, who were all devoted
to him. Of course he avoided
telling the Vernons, for three
girls and one aged lady could do
little in the matter, except feel very
anxious for his safety. On the
other hand, he was not the man to
avenge, or even protect, himself.
But as he was constantly out till
late in the evening, preaching at
different churches, giving retreats,
and visiting the sick, several of
the men who formed part of the
congregation decided that he was
never to be allowed to go down
that treacherous winding path
which leads from the Strada Nuova
through the vineyards and garden to
Casinelli, except accompanied by
one of them. The terraces are
admirably adapted for shooting
down upon your enemy, as he
passes just beneath you, while you
lie concealed amongst the beans
<pb n='550'/><anchor id='Pg550'/>
above. At length some of the
wiser and more authoritative of
the men, disgusted at the annoyances
to which the females of the
Vernon household were exposed,
and at the threats against Padre
Cataldo's life, had Martorelli summoned
before the magistrates as
a disturber of the peace. This
strong measure kept him quiet for
some time; and it was during
this happy interval that Frank and
Don Emidio Gandolfi returned
from their long wanderings, Frank,
of course, to take up his abode with
us, and Don Emidio to return to
his Neapolitan villa, his principal
residence being in Rome.
</p>

<p>
The day of their return we were
all sitting in the <foreign rend='italic'>loggia</foreign> together
watching the evening light, which,
falling on the rocks of Sorrento
and on the island of Capri, seemed
to turn them into pink topaz set
in a sapphire sea. I was eagerly relating
the history of the bell to our
two gentlemen, and, forgetting that
Don Emidio was an Italian, I
launched out in strong expressions
against the cunning and intrigue of
the whole nation. In the midst of
my harangue I suddenly looked up,
and there was Don Emidio leaning
forward with his elbows on his
knees, his hands loosely clasped,
his deep, calm eyes fixed on my eager
face, and a slight, sly smile curving
his well-defined mouth. I stopped
dead short, and blushed to the eyes.
We were so used to seeing him with
us, and to hearing him talk in his
perfect English, that, in the heat of
my discourse, I forgot I was abusing
his countrymen. Frank laughed
outright when, looking at Don
Emidio, he saw the expression
which had so suddenly arrested
me, and Mary alone looked sorry
for me.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Don Emidio!</q> I exclaimed,
<q>I forgot you were not one of us. I
forgot you were an Italian.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It needs no apology, signorina.
I agree with a great deal that you
say. In the first place, you spoke
chiefly of Neapolitans. I am only
half a Neapolitan. And, secondly,
whatever you may think of Italians
you are too just not to believe
there are many honest men amongst
them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are very kind to let me
off so easily. No one who knew
Padre Cataldo, who is a Neapolitan,
could fail to believe in the possibility
of honest Italians.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me, signorina, if I say
that you would be nearly as far
wrong in taking Padre Cataldo as
a guarantee for there being honest
men amongst us as you would be
in believing us all rogues because
you have met with people like the
Casinelli.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why so?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Because saints are as much an
exception to the generality as are
accomplished Machiavellians like
the Casinelli.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are right,</q> said Mary.
<q>But do you not think that just as
the French are specially addicted
to vanity, so the Italians are to intrigue?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I do. It is the reverse of the
medal. The French are sanguine,
and the drawback to that is self-conceit.
The Italians are astute,
and the corresponding defect is
cunning.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As Emidio is too sensible to be
thin-skinned at our speaking out
our thoughts,</q> interrupted Frank,
<q>I must say that I have always
thought the Italians great in duplicity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The Italian does not care to tell
you an untruth about a trifle. If he
did so, it would be from carelessness
rather than from purpose. But when
<pb n='551'/><anchor id='Pg551'/>
once he sees his way, or thinks he
sees it, to accomplishing some distant
and important end, then the full
strength of his close-knit mind and
his marvellous faculty of mental investigation
are brought to bear. He
is unscrupulous because he is passionate.
Not passionate only as a
sudden burst, but condensed, sustained
passion. The object he has in
view, no matter what it be, becomes
the object of his passion, and gradually
he weaves around it the web of his
whole being. With fixed, undeviating
purpose, he bends all things to
one point. If truth will serve him, he
will employ truth; where that fails,
deceit will be as readily adopted.
He overlooks mountains and valleys,
walls and barriers, in pursuit
of his end; or rather he sees through
them, as if they were merely a mist,
and fixes his unflinching gaze on
what he is resolved to obtain beyond
them. So long as his purpose
is unchanged, nothing will stay his
progress. Once that changed, no
matter how or why&mdash;out of his own
will or through the will of others&mdash;and
the whole fabric of deceit passes
from him like a mantle loosely
draped from his shoulders, only to
be resumed when next required.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You seem to me to have made
it out very clearly, Emidio,</q> said
Frank. <q>Now, what is the good side
of this disagreeable picture?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The good side is the strength
of will and the power of sustained
and concentrated thought and purpose.
Turn all that in the right
direction, and you will find it leads
you to a long list of heroic saints,
surpassed in no country, and equalled
only in Spain, where some of
the like characteristics exist.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But surely,</q> said I, <q>France
also is a great land of saints.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No doubt. But, generally speaking
(of course there are exceptions),
they belong to a different category.
The greatest contemplatives have
been Italian or Spanish.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, Don Emidio, I don't like to
think that nationality, which seems
to include temperament, and even
climate, can have anything to do
with the making of God's saints.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And why, signorina, should you
object to it when He who makes
his saints makes also the climate
and the temperament? He has
linked the outer and inner world
too closely together for us to have
any reason to be astonished that
he should observe certain general
laws in connection with the gifts of
his highest graces.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mary started forward from the
depths of her arm-chair, and said
eagerly: <q>Then do you really think
that the slower temperament and
depressing climate of England, for
example, have prevented, and will
prevent, our country from being
honored by great saints?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am very far from thinking it.
On the contrary, and strange as
it may appear at first sight, there are
certain characteristics amongst the
English which assimilate them, in
my mind, to the Italians in a way I
never could assimilate the French. I
allude to your steadiness of purpose
and to your reserved and silent
habits. These qualities, when laid
hold of by grace, tend to lead to
contemplation and mystic holiness,
much as do the qualities we have
spoken of among Italians.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then, I suppose, the extraordinary
energy and versatility of the
French are likely to make them
more active than contemplative.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Just so, signorina, and yet
there have been wonderful exceptions;
and I should be wrong
in making out anything like a
rigid rule. In the first place,
<q>the wind bloweth where it listeth</q>;
<pb n='552'/><anchor id='Pg552'/>
and, in the next, the demarcations
of national character are
not sufficiently strong to necessitate
any given development of even
mere natural qualities, much less
of spiritual qualities.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I suppose, in short, all you really
mean, Don Emidio,</q> resumed Mary,
<q>is that, when it pleases God to
make a saint in the full acceptation
of the term, he makes use of natural
conditions blended with the supernatural.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>God always works with a method,
signora&mdash;by rule and measure.
We cannot solve all the
divine problems; but we know
that they are according to truth
and justice.</q>
</p>

<p>
Don Emidio's last words seemed
to shut us all up in silent thought.
Frank went on puffing at his cigar in
a way which set my wicked imagination
wondering how far smoking
was conducive to meditation. But
then I never heard of a saint who
smoked. Perhaps if any very holy
man, whose canonization was in progress,
had been given to smoking,
the devil's advocate would lay hold
of it, and try to destroy the cause. I
do not think tobacco was much in
vogue when the great modern saints
lived. S. Philip Neri, for instance,
that large-hearted, <q>large-sleeved</q><note place='foot'>Literal translation of an Italian term meaning
without narrow prejudice.</note>
saint&mdash;I wonder if, in these days, he
would have smoked? But then he
was a priest. That makes a great
difference. I think a layman might
have an occasional cigar. There
is that dear old Frank lighting his
second. But Don Emidio has had
only two tiny cigarettes. What
nonsense runs in my head! And,
meanwhile, the red lights have all
died away. Capri lies like a large,
dense cloud on the bosom of the
sea; and though all the sunlight
has faded from the sky, there is a
strange color of mingled purple and
orange that seems to flash upon
the water, and that I never saw
anywhere except in the Bay of Naples.
Presently we are roused
from our reverie by the sound of
voices; and Ida's tall figure stands
by the open window looking out
upon us, while Elizabeth and Helen
are behind.
</p>

<p>
<q>How silent you all are!</q> exclaims
Ida with a laugh. <q>I am
afraid we shall disturb you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! it is only that Don Emidio
has been talking to us so much
about heroic sanctity that we are
all in a state of depression from
the consciousness that we have no
hope of ever reaching it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am quite sure you never will,
if you set about it in this melancholy
fashion. Besides, nobody is a
saint till he is dead; and who
knows but what you may live to
pray at my tomb yet?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><emph>Yours</emph>, Ida dear?</q> said Mary
quite gravely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why not? There are so many
kinds of saints; and I may yet
come out as quite a new variety.
But that is not what I am come
about. Padre Cataldo is gone to
see the poor man I told Mary of
this morning. He has got the fever,
and, when he is delirious, he keeps
calling so piteously for the padre
that this is the second time to-day
he has had to toil up our hill to go
to him, besides all his other toils.
As soon as the man is pacified, he
promised to come here. He told
us at dinner that to-morrow will be
a free day, and that for once he
could make an excursion with us,
if we liked to go to Baiæ.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was soon all settled. I thought
it strange the two gentlemen did not
wish to ride, but preferred coming
in the carriage with us. For my
<pb n='553'/><anchor id='Pg553'/>
part, I longed to be on horseback,
and, in their place, I would have
ridden. Padre Cataldo looked in
for a moment to learn our plans,
and then Don Emidio took leave
of us. He had a long way to drive
home.
</p>

<p>
<q>Your villa is on the Vomero, is
it not?</q> I said.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, signorina; it is at Capo di
Monte. Do you prefer the Vomero?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! dear, no. I think Capo di
Monte very beautiful.</q>
</p>

<p>
He was holding my hand, as he
wished me good-night. I thought
what an odd question it was to ask
me. What could it matter which I
liked best? I told Mary I thought
Don Emidio was sometimes a little
absent, and hardly knew what he
was saying. But I suppose Mary
did not agree with me, for she only
smiled and made no answer.
</p>

<p>
The next morning I overheard
Mary lamenting to Frank about the
way in which Paolino disturbed
her rest, beginning, as early as half-past
four, firing at the little birds in
the garden. I used to envy that
lad his faculty for early rising.
The first streak of light through
his shutterless window saw Paolino
on the alert. And then he would
go strolling out into the garden,
leaning over the low wall that divided
our entrance from the main
road, hailing all his comrades on
their way to their work, whistling
and shouting to his sisters, who
lived in a portion of the villa where
we had originally thought of taking
apartments but for its dirty and
miserable condition. These noises
so early in the morning, and close
to our windows, were bad enough;
but when to these the constant firing
of a gun was added, Mary's
powers of endurance failed. It
would have been a waste of feeling
to compassionate the birds, who
flew away from Paolino's aim with
perfect impunity. It was therefore
from no apprehensions for the few
songsters of a garden in Southern
Italy that we complained. But all
day long Paolino was absent at inopportune
moments, attempting a
hopeless massacre of sparrows and
finches. He had often been scolded
about it, but the instinct of sport
in the boy was superior to any fear
of being found fault with. When
at length it reached such a pitch
that Mary even was induced to
complain, Paolino had to endure a
sharp scolding from Frank. The
result of which was that, a few
hours after, he took the gun, with
tears in his eyes, to Monica, requesting
her to carry it to his father,
that through him it might be
returned to the friend who had
lent him the fatal weapon. He alleged
that he had not the moral
courage to have the gun in his possession,
and yet refrain from inordinate
use of it; and thus, as he said,
the only way was to put the occasion
out of his reach. The little
birds enjoyed peaceful matins ever
after, and Paolino rose wonderfully
in our esteem.
</p>

<p>
The roomy landau and the impish
coachman were ready early to
take us on our long excursion;
while Pascarillo, the coachman's
master, and the owner of many
carriages, provided another conveyance
for the rest of the party. Don
Emidio went with Mary, Ida, and
myself; Padre Cataldo and Frank
with Mrs. Vernon and the other
girls. We took the Posilippo road,
intending to return by the Grotto
of Puzzuoli. Nothing can be more
beautiful than the view which
greets you at the top of the hill, and
which, in a steep winding descent,
brings you to the town of Puzzuoli.
<pb n='554'/><anchor id='Pg554'/>
To the left is a high bank of verdure
covered with flowering shrubs,
and here and there a goat browsing
on some almost inaccessible peak.
The sea always seemed to me to be
even bluer here than in the Bay of
Naples. We drive past places
bearing some of the grandest names
of antiquity; Puzzuoli itself was
once a <q>little Rome</q>; Cicero's
villa was here; here Sylla died.
Temples unrivalled in beauty covered
those hill-sides, and villas
with umbrageous trees were dotted
all over those flat plains where the
willows wave their long, yellow
twigs amid rows of tall poplars,
and here and there a plane-tree.
Here are the market gardens that
supply Naples, or rather a portion
of them. But all the land is full of
sulphur springs, and it is only in
certain seasons of the year that
Puzzuoli and its neighborhood is
fit for habitation. Then Neapolitans
and strangers come to take the
sulphur baths, the hateful vapors
of which catch our breath as we
pass. I have a growing sense of
everything being unreal around me;
and no length of time or habit removes
the impression. The sea
has swallowed up one-half of the
spots sacred to classic memories.
But where are the trees of Cicero's
villa that Pliny praises? What
wild havoc or gradual but most
obliterating change has availed to
wipe away all but the faintest traces
of what once was looked on as a
paradise? Fire and water alike
have combined to erase the last
relics of that luxurious pagan time.
The volcanic action in all this part
of Italy and the encroaching ocean
have sufficed to wipe out all but
the faintest indications of a state of
luxury, wealth, architectural beauty,
and lavish decoration to which
old Phœnicia, Greece, and Rome
had lent their aid in the long course
of ages. Never was ruin greater,
perhaps, since the beginning of the
Christian era. Sodom and Gomorrah,
Nineveh and Babylon, have
passed away more entirely. But in
Puzzuoli, Misenum, Cumæ, and
Baiæ the ruin is more pathetic,
from the fact that enough remains
to betray how vast those villas and
baths and temples once were, and
how absolutely the aggressive force
of silent nature has overpowered
and swept away or buried the
proud achievements of man.
</p>

<p>
We proceed from one marvel of
destruction to another. The Mare
Morto is to our right, shrunk to a
tiny lake; and yet this was to have
been, when completed, the great
port for Roman merchandise. The
same melancholy feeling of utter
destruction and radical change in
the whole aspect of the country
fills the mind wherever we turn;
and through all the excursions we
made in this neighborhood, I never
found it less; while Mary, who had
been here many years ago, recollected
having experienced the same
impression, and found that it returned
upon her, if possible, with fuller
force. It may be as well to remind
my readers that the ancient name
of Puzzuoli was Puteoli. And perhaps
in no one place are crowded,
within a circumference of about
twelve miles around it, so many and
such intimate associations with pagan
Rome and the old classic life.
The crumbling tufa-banks by the
road-side are filled with rectangular
Roman bricks, the remains of baths
connected with the villa residences
and temples of antiquity. Also,
there are considerable remains of
Columbaria and large tombs. We
passed beneath the Arco Felice,
and, clambering up a high bank,
reached the cottage of a <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>vignaiuolo</foreign>,
<pb n='555'/><anchor id='Pg555'/>
and rested beneath an elm-tree
while I made a drawing of Lago
Fusaro and part of the Elysian
Fields. We saw the Lake of Lucrinus,
but the oysters are gone. We
shuddered as we approached Avernus.
The dense forest which once
flung its black shadows on the
waters has long ago been felled or
died away. The wholesome mid-day
sun shot laughing beams on the
clear surface, disarmed of all preternatural
horror. The Elysian Fields
are, indeed, a smiling plain of land
partially cultivated, and partially
covered with trees and brush-wood,
the king's favorite hunting-grounds.
We women refused to enter the
Sibyl's cave, liking neither damp
nor sulphurous smells. The horrors
of the surroundings are all swept
away. The little birds fly over the
once deadly Lake of Avernus as
safely as from Paolino's harmless
gun; and as we look back through
the dim avenue of misty ages, it is
curious to reflect that what is a
dream of the past to ourselves was
hardly less so to others who are
now but shadowy representatives
of a world gone by to us; for it
was Agrippa whose engineering
robbed Avernus of many of its terrors,
and probably disturbed even
the placid oysters of Lucrinus.
Thus the sense of unreality grows
upon us, as we visit one spot after
another, and find the green tendrils
of the young vine, the blue-purple
blossoms of the vetch, and bright
scarlet poppies covering with gay
garlands the few vestiges of a world
that is dead and gone. Yet even
here I am tempted to repeat, <q>Le
passé n'est pas mort, il n'est qu'absent,</q><note place='foot'>The past is absent, but not dead.</note>
and yet how far absent!
How the old gods have died away
from their own sylvan scenes, and
the nymphs fled, shamefaced, from
lakes no longer solitary! Victor
Emanuel will scare no dryads
from their leafy bowers, and is
hardly the man to trace the small
footprint of the chaste huntress on
the yielding moss, as he pursues
the wild boar through what were
doubtless once her covers. No
laughing Bacchante peeps behind
the trailing vine, or dances, with
light, flowing tresses and scanty
tunic, to the trilling of double pipes.
The goats are here, but the satyrs
are absent. The vines show promise
of rich grapes; but Bacchus,
grape-crowned, with the skin of the
spotted pard across his sun-bronzed
chest, and the tragic melancholy
of liquid eyes with sleepy lids, is
nowhere found; for, be it remembered,
the god of wine was no
drunken lout, but rather one who,
at least in his ripe youth, was but
quickened and inspired by the
blood of the red grape.
</p>

<p>
The myths and fables have long
ceased. As myths, they held a divine
truth, dimly shadowed forth.
As fables, they degenerated, like all
half-truths, into wholesale errors.
Then human depravity swept over
them, and left its poisonous slime
o'er all. We go back to the memory
of those times with mingled feelings
of wonder and of pain. But
amid the decaying fragments of
classic lore there shines forth one
little incident which quickens our
pulse, and bridges over all the succeeding
ages with a touch of feeling
that obliterates time and space. The
words are few, but they are dearer to
us than the epics of Virgil, or the letters
of Cicero, or all else that may
grace the memory of this lovely land:
<q>The south wind blowing, we came
the second day to Puteoli, where,
finding brethren, we were desired
to tarry with them seven days.</q>
</p>

<pb n='556'/><anchor id='Pg556'/>

<p>
<q>Finding brethren!</q> Yes, even
here, beneath the shade of marble
porticos, temple, and fane devoted
to an infamous religion, the Name
that is above every name was whispered
by a few. The sign of the
cross was secretly made by quiet
inhabitants of Puzzuoli's noisy
streets, the Virgin Mother was revered,
and the words of S. Paul and
S. Luke listened to as a message
from above. And how little the
citizens of Puteoli knew of the divine
mysteries which were going on
among them! And now, as if the
wicked city had been in every sense
too near the gate of hell, the volcanic
flames have penetrated the
earth's thin crust on all sides, and
flung down and devoured the traces
of brilliant, triumphant, and overbearing
vice, leaving in its place
a handful of Christian peasants
and a few relics prized by the
scholar and the antiquarian.
</p>

<p>
I must own to my readers that I
am chiefly repeating Don Emidio's
words, and that, as we approached
Baiæ, I with startling indecorum
exclaimed: <q>But it must not be
forgotten that we have come here
to eat oysters, whether or not the
Lake of Lucrinus produces them.</q>
We did eat oysters. We alighted
at the humblest little wayside inn
close to the shore. We sat beneath
the trellised vine that covered the
vast <foreign rend='italic'>loggia</foreign>. The lemons were gathered,
as sauce for the oysters, in
the garden below; the ruins of the
circular temple of Venus or Mercury
shone, deep red, in the light of
the setting sun. The merry landlord
and a half-dozen nondescript
servants, men and maids, proposed
to dance the <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>tarantella</foreign> for us.
The women happened to lack
beauty, and the men youth. But
that was not our reason for declining
the pleasure. The dance was
doubtless innocent enough; but it
was not often we were favored
with the company of <q>Nostro Zio
Prete,</q> our uncle priest, and we
thought it more decorous not to
order dances in his presence. I
must explain to my readers that
the peasantry in South Italy call a
priest uncle when they do not call
him father; and that in some of
our excursions, when Padre Cataldo
bargained about carriages or refreshment
(and which must always
be done if you do not want to
be scandalously overcharged), they
always protested that for no consideration
would they attempt to
impose on their uncle priest!
Happily for us, our reverend uncle
was a Neapolitan, and too well acquainted
with the true value of the
services we received for us to have
any apprehension of being cheated
in any expedition organized by him.
Perhaps our host himself surmised
our reason for declining the <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>tarantella</foreign>,
for he did not press it; and
returning to our carriage, we drove
home by moonlight through the
Grotto of Puzzuoli.

<head>Switzerland In 1873.</head>

<p>
Lake Of Lucerne.
</p>

<p>
It was a lovely evening as we
sailed away, a happy, lively party,
from Lucerne. Our minds were
full of the enthusiasm for his native
land which Herr H&mdash;&mdash;'s descriptions
had excited, but for one
characteristic of the Lake of the
Forest Cantons we were as yet
totally unprepared, namely, its
unusual and wonderful variety.
</p>

<p>
Every traveller viewing it from
Lucerne readily admits its extreme
beauty. Its interest is acknowledged
beforehand, according to the
greater or lesser degree in which
each one can clothe its shores with
historic memories, but its remarkable
diversity of scenery is a feature
generally ignored until seen, although
amongst Swiss lakes it is
in this respect pre-eminent. And
this peculiarity is mainly attributable
to its geographical formation.
Consisting, as it does, of divisions
completely distinct one from the
other, they lead us on, as if designedly
arranged in the most artistic
manner, in a series of <q>surprises,</q>
from one picture to another, on an
ever-increasing scale of beauty.
</p>

<p>
That part of the lake which is
nearest to Lucerne may be said to
resemble in shape a Maltese cross,
so equal do its proportions appear
to the passing observer. In characteristics
and detail, however, it differs
widely. The northern shores,
though spreading round two of
the arms in undulating hills, may
decidedly be called flat compared
to the magnificent line of Alpine
peaks towering along the southern
extremity. At one of the angles
of the cross stands Mount Pilatus,
5,900 feet high&mdash;at the opposite
one the Rigi, 5,541 feet above the
sea&mdash;like two sentinels guarding the
entrance to the territory beyond.
The tourist sailing straight onwards
from Lucerne is fain to believe
that the lake ends where a spur of
the Rigi seems to stretch across the
southern bay, right before him.
No other explanation appears possible
until the spot itself is reached,
when suddenly a channel, hitherto
unperceived, opens to the
right, between that mountain and
the opposite shore&mdash;the two promontories
thus disclosed rejoicing
in the rather ignoble appellation of
<q>Die Nasen,</q> or <q>The Noses.</q>
What a beautiful and perfectly
different view is then disclosed, as
the steamer darts through the
narrow strait to the village of
Buochs, at the foot of its own
Buochserhorn, the base of which is
covered with comfortable farm-houses,
embosomed in their orchards,
changing step by step into
châlets as they ascend to the higher
pastures! At once we have got
into another country. A landlocked
bay, that to the eye seems
nearly circular, bordered on one
side by the precipitous but wooded
mountains of Unterwalden, and on
the opposite by the southern peaks
and slopes of the Rigi, between
whose folds nestles pretty Gersau,
not large enough to be called a
town nor unimportant enough for
a village. A sunny, peaceful
<pb n='558'/><anchor id='Pg558'/>
picture&mdash;a <q>happy <hi rend='italic'>lake</hi> of Rasselas</q>&mdash;from
which no exit is
visible, nor, we might suppose,
ever need be sought for! At the
further end, towering in the distance,
snow-clad summits peer
above the clouds; but, more striking
than all, rise two curiously-pointed
peaks close by, which stand,
we are told, right above the white
houses of Schwyz. So here we are
truly in the cradle of Switzerland&mdash;the
genuine <q>Urschweiz</q>! And
as we sail towards Brunnen (the
port of Schwyz, three miles inland)
we try to trace their resemblance
to a bishop's distinctive mark,
which has given to these two bare
rocks, nearly five thousand feet
high, the familiar name of <q>The
Mitres.</q>
</p>

<p>
But where is the land of Tell&mdash;Uri
and the Rüti?&mdash;for again our
course seems barred at Brunnen:
valleys, meadows, and a background
of mountains alone lie before
us. Once more turn round
on the quay of Brunnen, at a sharp
angle to the right, and say, can a
more exquisite picture anywhere be
found! Here, in this bay of Uri&mdash;for
so this part is named&mdash;instead
of the great expanse near
Lucerne, the lake has narrowed
into a space not wider than a valley,
whilst huge mountains jut forward,
and, dipping perpendicularly
into the green waters beneath, barely
leave room in some spots for the
road, which is an engineering
achievement of recent years, whilst
in others it must needs be carried
on through tunnels and open
galleries. Right in front, the Uri
Rothstock rears its lofty head, with
its glacier&mdash;a transparent wall of
ice three hundred feet in height&mdash;sparkling
in the sun. Tell's home
lies within its folds. But close by,
just opposite, is the Rüti, almost
undistinguishable until the steamer
passes near it. At the head of the
bay, on its broad, green meadows,
lies Aldorf, below the Bristenstock,
which alone, when we reach that
spot, hides from us the mighty
Gothard. A paradise it truly
seems on a brilliant sunny day,
with a people worthy of such a land
and nurtured into excellence amidst
this noble nature. But we have
not reached them yet, and have to
see and hear of others before we
come to this quarter.
</p>

<p>
Like every other part of Switzerland,
the shores of Lucerne Lake
are thickly inhabited. No signs
of poverty are anywhere visible,
and an air of comfort is diffused
over the whole district. The most
fruitful portion, however, is pre-eminently
the strip of land lying at the
base of the Rigi, where the straight
wall of the mountain rises precipitately
facing the north. So proverbial
is its fertility that it is called
the <q>Garden of Lucerne,</q> and
through winter and summer that
town is supplied with fruit and vegetables
by the peasants of this
neighborhood. The steamers which
now navigate the lake carry them
thither in numbers with their produce
on every market-day. Of its
numerous villages, Weggis held the
first place until the last three years,
when the engineers of the wonderful
Rigi Railway fixed on Vitznau,
three miles further on, for their
station. Up to that period, no one
ever thought of this out-of-the-way
little village, lying in a sheltered
nook close under the Rigi-Nase.
Weggis, on the other hand, was the
starting-point for all aspirants to
sunsets on the Kulm: the chief
place for horses and guides, and
full, in consequence, of animation
and importance. But the world
marches on rapidly nowadays,
<pb n='559'/><anchor id='Pg559'/>
and matters, therefore, are much
changed; for few, except the timid,
or the most determined seekers of
the picturesque, think of choosing
this route to the summit, when both
time and trouble can be saved by
the railway ascent to those hundreds
of summer tourists whose
excursions are made at high-pressure
speed. Vitznau, consequently,
is daily advancing in importance,
and the price of land has risen in
an incredibly short space of time
from fifty centimes to five francs
per metre. No buildings, however,
have yet been attempted, except
two pretty hotels; and it was to one
of these, opened this season on the
water's edge, that we had telegraphed
for rooms. But it was not large
enough to accommodate all our
party, so my friend Anna L&mdash;&mdash; and
myself adjourned at night to the
second one, situated further back
near the church.
</p>

<p>
The evening continued fine, and
as the moon shone on the calm
waters whilst we supped under the
veranda of the inn, every one was
happy and contented. The young
C&mdash;&mdash;s declared they felt <q>most
romantic,</q> we elders <q>sehr æsthetisch</q>
(very æsthetic), as Heine
calls it, and all looked forward
with confidence to the morrow.
The plan was, by sleeping here, to
start in the first train, which is generally
the least crowded, and, halting
at Kaltbad, thence to explore
the other parts of the Rigi. It had
been devised by Herr H&mdash;&mdash;<q>cunningly
devised,</q> he secretly
told Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, <q>in order to humor
the nerves of the ladies, always
stronger in the early morning,
and which he knew, though he
chose to conceal this fact from us,
would be sorely tried by the alarming
railway.</q> As to a change of
weather, no one ever dreamt of it.
There had been such a spell of fine
days and lovely moonlights that
nothing else was taken into account.
But, alas for presumptuous
confidence! What was our dismay
on awaking to hear the unwelcome
sounds of rain! Patter!
patter! drop after drop, it fell
against the window; and, rising in
trepidation, the painful fact became
evident that a steady downpour
had commenced. There was no
wind, but such thick clouds rolled
down from the mountain and spread
over the lake that the opposite
shore was soon invisible. It might
pass off, and we determined to have
patience; so, when the bell tolled
for Mass at half-past seven o'clock,
seizing our umbrellas we rushed
across the cemetery, which separated
our hotel from the church.
This latter, as suited to so small a
village, is not large nor rich-looking&mdash;on
the contrary; but all was very
clean, the building solidly constructed,
and the congregation, despite
the rain, fairly large, and
most attentive. Everything was
arranged, too, on the same system
as elsewhere. The cemetery full
of holy-water stoups, with a separate
corner for the children, the
church doors open all day long, the
lighted lamp betokening the Blessed
Sacrament, and men and women
often, as we noticed, passing in and
out, to say a prayer in its divine
presence.
</p>

<p>
At half-past nine the train was to
start, but the rain grew heavier
each minute, and no one, we supposed,
could think of ascending the
mountain in such weather. At the
appointed time, however, the steamers
arrived from both ends of the
lake, with their ship-loads of enterprising
tourists. How we pitied
them! To have come so far in
this weather, only to be disappointed&mdash;for
<pb n='560'/><anchor id='Pg560'/>
no one surely could land
on such a day! But experience
has since taught us differently, and
shown that in no part of Switzerland,
or perhaps of any other country,
does this class so pertinaciously
defy the elements as on the
Lucerne Lake and the Rigi Railway.
To-day, from behind our hotel
windows, we watched hundreds
rushing on shore, in their water-proofs,
and with dripping umbrellas,
to the railway station&mdash;adventurous
spirits, who trusted to their
good stars to drive away the clouds
from the mountain-top on their arrival;
or, if the views should fail
them, at least to go through the
<q>sensation</q> of this singular railway.
And, in this one respect, no
one could be disappointed. A
<q>sensation</q> it certainly would be:
whether pleasant or terrifying must
depend on each individual temperament.
</p>

<p>
And now the sloping engines
emerged from their night's hiding-place,
and we too began to share
the general excitement. One by
one our party ran to the pretty
station, and there stood examining
the proceedings. So fascinating did
the attraction become, that every
time there was an arrival or departure
whilst we remained at Vitznau,
books, writing, and all other occupations
were hastily thrown aside
to scamper off to the still novel
sight. But a very unwise course
this proved; for, instead of reassuring
our feeble nerves, the disinclination
to make a personal experience
of the ascent visibly increased
as the day wore on. And what
wonder! The engines were unlike
any we had ever seen; shaped in
a slanting fashion to fit the mountain
side. There were five, but
of these each one was attached
to only one carriage, which contains
cross benches for fifty passengers
(with an ominous printed request
<q>not to move!</q>), and with
open sides, so that nothing should
obstruct the view to those whose
nerves might retain their customary
tranquillity. Five such trains
compose each departure, hence,
should the arrivals exceed 250, the
unlucky <q>last</q> are left behind at
Vitznau to wait patiently for the
next trains&mdash;two or three hours
later. And now we understood
the cause of the rush on shore, and
the violent squeezing between the
rails of the ticket office, which had
so much puzzled and amused us.
</p>

<p>
In mid-season this constantly
happens, it being a case of <q>first
come, first served.</q> Even to-day,
all the carriages were full. As a
rule, therefore, it is calculated that
on an average between 1,100 and
1,200 tourists daily ascend the
Rigi during the summer months
from this point alone. Up they
went at a short interval between
each train; the engine not preceding,
but pushing the carriage before
it&mdash;mounting slowly to all
appearances, but withal rapidly,
for in less than five minutes they
were lost to sight; climbing first
high above the church-tower, and
then above the cottages, which
one by one here overtop the village.
It took away one's breath
to look at them: a seeming tempting
of Providence thus scaling
mountain walls and precipices at
the measure of from 18° to 25°&mdash;perhaps
all the more awe-inspiring
to day by reason of the weather
and the mysterious cloud-land
they boldly pierced through.
</p>

<p>
As yet, no serious accident has
happened. Let us hope none ever
may! The principle of construction,
with a central notched rail,
tightly grasped by a cog-wheel, besides
<pb n='561'/><anchor id='Pg561'/>
the powerful brakes belonging
to each carriage, seem to promise
fairly. The trains, too, proceed in
reality so slowly, and with such
caution, that a man is always able
to walk in front of the first carriage.
Most striking was it to watch the
down trains two hours later; the
guard blowing a horn as they
passed the height above the village,
then marching into the station with
a solemn countenance that seemed
to tell of perils met and conquered,
leisurely followed by the sloping engine,
looking helpless and distorted
once it reached the level ground.
Steady and serious-looking men
these guards and engine-drivers
are, quite unlike the daring beings
to whose care we so thoughtlessly
entrust our precious lives in every-day
railway travelling. In walk
and dress, too, they have a mountain
air and bearing, at once telling
us of the life to which they were
<q>born and bred,</q> and reminding
us of the intrusion of our material
world into their hitherto simple
sphere. So far, however, it does
not appear to have interfered with
Vitznau habits. Being what the
French call a <q>cul de sac,</q> without
even a road over the promontory
to Gersau, there is no temptation
to linger here, and the trains and
steamers are made to fit in so exactly
that, except in the case of
undue numbers, or for a hasty luncheon,
few travellers ever do remain.
Nothing struck us so much during our
enforced stay as the sudden relapse
into its ordinary quiet which took
place at Vitznau the moment train
or steamer passed on.
</p>

<p>
The nature of its position will
also prevent this pretty village from
ever losing much of its original
character. It consists of but forty
or fifty houses situated on a narrow
ledge, a small strip of land, between
the precipitous Rigi cliffs on one
side and the lake on the other, so
that room does not exist for very
large extension. Only this summer
it narrowly escaped destruction from
the effects of a thunder-storm
higher up, such as had not been
known for years. The stream overflowed
into a torrent, carrying all
before it, and the villagers and railway
officials had to turn out in the
middle of the night to open channels
and raise embankments, and
only succeeded by great exertions
in arresting destruction. Personally,
I should fear the rocks rolling
from above more, as they have
often done at Weggis&mdash;but of this
the natives seem to take no account.
We were told that there is
one point on the road between this
and Weggis&mdash;to which larger village
the Vitznau children go to school,
three miles distant&mdash;where stones
fall so constantly that the little
ones are always on the look-out,
and make a run when they see
them approaching. Yet this pretty
spot has many attractions, especially
for invalids. We met a gentleman
lately who had passed a winter here,
and was loud in its praises. Nothing
can exceed the morality and
sobriety of the people; the winter
climate, too, is perfect&mdash;he and the
parish priest had made observations
together during one season, which
proved that the temperature is as
mild as that of Montreux and of
other sheltered spots on this side
of the Alps. Fruit grows here
abundantly, even figs and melons,
as in Italy, and flowers thrive
equally well. One of the prettiest
features in the place was the numberless
girls in front of the station
with small baskets of each&mdash;the
grapes having just arrived from
Italy over the St. Gotthard, and
come hither by the steamers; but
<pb n='562'/><anchor id='Pg562'/>
the <q>fresh figs</q> and <q>beautiful
peaches</q> which they offer in excellent
English are genuine Vitznau
productions.
</p>

<p>
The day advanced, yet there
seemed no cessation of the downpour,
and all were in despair at being
thus caught at such a spot, without
the resources even of a large
hotel. At last <q>a happy thought</q>
suggested the idea of our abandoning
the Rigi altogether! <q>Let us
move on to Gersau,</q> said one&mdash;<q>just
round the corner!</q> broke in
another weather-bound traveller,
who gave a glowing report of its
charms and comforts. Even the
young people, who in the morning
were so anxious for the railroad excitement,
were worn out by waiting
and the little likelihood of a change.
<q>No sooner said than done</q> was
therefore the result of our conversation,
and the telegraph had ordered
our rooms, and our luggage was on
board the steamer, before we almost
reflected on the consequences.
But what matter if we never saw
the Rigi! It was more than likely
those travellers would never reach
the top in that dreadful railway, and
our vexed spirits refused to recognize
the attractions of anything on
such an afternoon but the prospective
charms of comfortable <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salons</foreign>
and piles of the latest newspapers,
which we prophetically beheld
awaiting us at Gersau. In twenty
minutes we had crossed to Buochs,
tried in vain to discover the landscape
thence&mdash;so lovely from this
point in fair weather&mdash;through the
heavy mist of rain and cloud hanging
over the lake, and found ourselves
lodged in <q>the palatial hotel</q>
(as the prospectus calls it) at Gersau,
close alongside the water's
edge.
</p>

<p>
No sooner were we fairly landed
than the curtain of cloud began to
rise, and we clearly beheld the opposite
shore. Half an hour afterwards,
we were discussing the possible
return of fine weather, when
a sudden commotion took place
around us. Waiters rushed right
and left closing windows, housemaids
even shutting shutters, without
any apparent reason, like demented
beings, not giving themselves
time to answer our questions.
At last, they declared that a storm
of wind was approaching, although
we could perceive no symptoms of
it, and truly, as they foretold, there
soon came rushing by one of those
sudden squalls against which kindly
guide-books have so many words
of warning. Small waves rose
rapidly, and in less than half an
hour, without one drop of rain, the
whole surface of the lake was in
commotion. Then came a great
excitement!&mdash;half the village and all
the travellers crowded to the shore,
and every eye fixed on the centre
of the lake told of a tiny boat in
extreme danger. Had the clouds
still continued, it could scarcely
have been seen, but now a large,
well-manned craft pulled out to the
rescue. It took a long time to
reach the sinking boat, for the lake
is wider here than it seems, but
at last there was a cry of joy on
shore when three men were seen to
jump from one to the other, and so
certain did we then feel of their
safety that only a few remained to
greet their arrival. The wind, too,
subsided, and later that evening the
moon struggled&mdash;though feebly&mdash;to
reassert her empire.
</p>

<p>
The Gersau Hotel is certainly
excellent, owing to the skilful direction
of Herr Müller, one of the
potentates of the place, as are the
majority of hotel-keepers in all
these Forest Cantons. He also built
the one at the Rigi-Scheideck, on
<pb n='563'/><anchor id='Pg563'/>
the peak above Gersau, equally
celebrated for its comfort; but lately
a company, which calls itself the
Regina Montium (one of the supposed
meanings of the word Rigi),
has purchased it together with
others on the mountain. We found
the Gersau establishment full, many
having come down from the higher
<q>pensions,</q> and amongst the
number two or three acquaintances
who laughed at our fear of
the railway and general lack of
spirit. But nothing is so discouraging
to tourists as rain, especially
when nearer to the end than to the
beginning of their rambles. We
were all in bad humor at the trick
the clouds had played us, and planless
and annoyed we all retired
early to bed that night.
</p>

<p>
But <q>la nuit porte conseil,</q> and
there is no resisting a sunshiny
morning! The Angelus-bell once
more awoke us, but this time to sun
and brightness. Again the church
was close by, its bell ringing for
half-past seven o'clock Mass. Anna
and I quickly answered its bidding.
It is a good-sized parish church,
of the solid, unarchitectural style
of building usual in these parts, but
making a pretty effect with its lofty
tower seen rising against the high
green hill behind it. To-day, the
Mass was for the dead, and the
benches were all full, as at Lucerne;
respectably dressed men on one
side, while the women knelt on the
other. What most struck us, however,
were the children; the boys
in front of the men, and about
twenty girls in the two front benches
opposite. These were in charge
of a devout-looking young school-mistress,
whose sweet, placid countenance
seemed to tell of pleasant
hours for her youthful scholars.
Later, we learned that the children,
though obliged to attend school by
law, are not compelled to attend
Mass, but that, as a rule, they do
so both by their own and their
parents' desire. Nothing could be
tidier than the little maidens' appearance;
their frocks clean, and
their hair neatly plaited round their
heads, all according to the same
pattern, probably as their mothers
had done before them; and so attentive
and reverential were they,
that although we strangers knelt
right behind them, not one ever
turned to look at us. Each had
her prayer-book, which she read attentively,
and, besides, her rosary
wound round her hand when not
in use, all in the same fashion and
of the same pattern. This small
incident carried our thoughts back
swiftly to another land, recalling a
sermon we had heard in London
by the Archbishop of Westminster,
when, after speaking of the olden
days of the true faith in England,
and the culpability of its first disturbers,
he made allowance for the
<q>invincible ignorance</q> of the mass
of its people nowadays; <q>for,</q>
exclaimed his grace, <q>who has
there been since then to teach the
little maidens their rosary, and to
bring them to our Lord and his
blessed Mother?</q> and we thanked
God, as we beheld the Gersau
children making their genuflections
with serious little countenances,
that there is still one nook at least
left in this world where the demon
of heresy and unbelief has not penetrated,
and where piety and reverence
are, from earliest childhood,
taught to go hand-in-hand with
modern life. At the offertory of
the Mass another peculiarity occurred.
Suddenly, an elderly woman
rose, and, going forward, was followed
by all the other women in
the church, who, in single file, advanced
towards the altar, walked
<pb n='564'/><anchor id='Pg564'/>
round it by a passage at the back,
laid an offering on the altar itself,
and then quietly returned to their
places. The oldest man, on the
other side, now rose, and followed
by all the men, in like manner proceeded
through the same ceremony,
only varied by their passing round
the altar from the contrary side, and
depositing, as did some of the women
too, an offering besides on a
small table in front of the choir.
It was weeks before I could learn
the origin of this custom, but then,
opening by chance an old history
of Switzerland, I found this rule
quoted from an ancient document,
which purported to regulate the relations
between pastor and people
some centuries ago. There it was
stated that the offering for the
priest should be laid on the altar
itself, and that for the sacristan on
a small table outside&mdash;so steadily
and closely do these conservative-republicans
still keep, even in
form, to the pattern of their ancestors.
</p>

<p>
The Mass being only one of
commemoration and not of burial,
the congregation soon dispersed to
their different avocations. In this
way tourists are so often deceived,
when, coming in at a late hour,
they find foreign churches empty.
</p>

<p>
I remember a Protestant lady
who had passed three winters in
Rome once asking me seriously if
Catholics ever went to holy communion.
I thought her mind must
be wandering, but discovered on
enquiry that she had never been inside
a church, even in Rome, before
eleven o'clock or later; therefore,
though many were hearing Mass,
she had noticed none at holy
communion. It had never occurred
to her that, contrary to her
Protestant custom, Masses were
begun, and devout Catholics received
holy communion in those
same churches, long before she
probably was awake each morning.
So in the present instance, the congregation,
consisting of working-men
and women, might have been
through half their daily occupations
before any traveller at Gersau
thought of looking in at the church,
<q>wondering at its desolation!</q>
</p>

<p>
The sun was streaming in brightly
through an open side-door, inviting
us to depart by that exit.
What a beautiful sight met us on
the threshold! The lake, placid
and sunny, framed in by surrounding
green slopes and peaks, lay close
in front, separated only by the
public road to Brunnen from a
beautiful little cemetery belonging
to the church. Here were a crowd
of pretty monuments, the majority I
in stone, but some in white marble,
in excellent taste, bordered with
flowers, or delicately twined round
with creeping roses and ivy. The
children's corner lay to the right,
and there an old woman was
sprinkling holy water and arranging
flowers on some of the poorer
graves, which lay between them
and the handsome tombs in the
pathway from the church-door to
the road&mdash;a path that quite formed
a <q>via sacra</q> of Gersau notabilities.
Judging from these, the
population would seem to consist
of Camenzinds and Küttels. An
occasional Müller figured on a
tombstone, but otherwise it might
safely be assumed that what was
not Camenzind was Küttel&mdash;if not
Küttel, Camenzind. The names,
even if only seen once, would have
attracted notice&mdash;Camenzind, especially,
had a <emph>non-local</emph> sound, and
we willingly jumped at the conclusion
that it may be one of those
which, according to Herr H&mdash;&mdash;'s
theory, still exist in these cantons,
<pb n='565'/><anchor id='Pg565'/>
and are equally to be found in
Swedish and Northern valleys to
this day. That they are the living
autocrats of Gersau admits of little
doubt, for every house above the
common run is certain on enquiry
to prove the property of this family.
The manufactory, too, at the
end of the village belongs to them.
A beautiful resting-place they certainly
have between their church
and the lake, which every Camenzind
and Küttel must have been
looking upon from their tenderest
years, for many centuries past.
</p>

<p>
When our party met at breakfast,
it was amusing to see what a complete
change the sun and general
brightness had effected. All were
equally bent on retracing our steps
at once, the railroad being the only
drawback in the foreground. The
juniors would not consent to give
that up on any account, but the elders
still hesitated, daunted by yesterday's
recollections. Opportunely,
a casual acquaintance proposed a solution
that conquered all difficulties.
He suggested that the younger folk
should take the railway, and the
timid, going on to the next steamboat
station&mdash;Weggis&mdash;get horses
there, and thence ascend by road
in the old-fashioned style. What
we (for I was among the latter
class) should lose in <q>sensation</q>
he asserted that we should gain in
interest and picturesqueness, and
his plan, suiting all parties, was at
once adopted.
</p>

<p>
Having an hour to spare before
the steamer was due, we strolled
through the village. No wonder
that Gersau has an individuality of
its own, for it is a rare specimen
descended almost to our own day of
those village <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>communes</foreign> Herr H&mdash;&mdash;
had spoken to us of, which, taking
advantage of the debts and embarrassments
of their feudal lords, had
purchased exemption from them
early in the middle ages. Indeed,
none of these small communities
retained their independence down
to late times with the exception of
Gersau. <q>It was forgotten, hidden
away in its beautiful retreat,</q> say
some; <q>steady, self-respecting, and
not quarrelsome,</q> say others, with
more likelihood of truth. At all
events, the fact is undeniable that
it owned obedience to none but its
own local authorities. Tradition
says, and the date is proudly recorded
on the wall of the town-hall&mdash;a
true peasant town-hall, only
one degree superior to the surrounding
houses&mdash;that the peasants
of Gersau, having put aside
their savings for this purpose during
ten years, bought their freedom
from the Counts von Moos, for the
sum of 690 <q>Pfund pfenninge,</q> in
1390. Years before, in 1359, they
had made a treaty with the four
Forest Cantons, and were acknowledged
by them as confederates,
which singular position this small
community retained until the
French invasion of 1798, since
which time they have been incorporated
with the Canton of Schwyz.
The place is, literally, nothing
more than a large village, said to
contain only 2,276 inhabitants, but,
seen from the lake with the animation
given to it by the tourist life,
and the manufactories of the Camenzinds
along the shore, it makes
the effect of a much larger population
and of a very thriving town.
Penetrating, however, as we did to
the original background of houses,
we found them of quite another
character. Swiss peasant dwellings,
in general, are more comfortable
than those of almost any country,
and so capacious as to be thoroughly
patriarchal, often sheltering
numberless children and grandchildren
<pb n='566'/><anchor id='Pg566'/>
together under the one
roof. These of Gersau look like
true family strongholds; as if they
contained in themselves the histories
of many generations, and
everything seemed so stationary, so
unmoved and immovable, that we
could not help thinking of Hawthorne's
description of an English
country village, where he fancied
he saw the grandfathers and grandmothers
marrying over and over
again in their descendants, so completely
had the place and people a
centenarian air about them. Pretty
it was, too, to see these picturesque
homes extending one above
the other up the defile behind,
amidst their orchards and fresh
green pasture-grounds, headed by
the Rigi-Scheideck Hotel, which
crowns the summit and looks quite
near, though it is not so in reality.
The intercourse between the two
now gives Gersau much stirring importance,
but, as in the case of
Weggis, the advance of <q>civilization</q>
is likely to prove of permanent
injury to it. Next year a railroad,
branching off from Kaltbad,
is to be finished along the brow to
the Scheideck, when the stream of
tourists will of course flow in that
direction. And perhaps nowhere
could there be more excuse for
abandoning <q>picturesque old ways.</q>
Although it seemed a short ascent,
and we saw a merry party starting
from the Pension Müller on horseback,
intending to dine and sleep
at the top, we found on enquiry
that it would take them at least
two and a half hours to reach the
Scheideck, and between three and
four hours for the unfortunate carriers
who followed soon after laden
with the ladies' huge trunks. Nothing
could be more painful than
to see these men, some quite
old, staggering under the weight,
and to know what a stiff climb
awaited them higher up. At present
there is no road up the hill
nor any other means of transport,
and the whole supplies for that
large establishment at the top have
to be taken up by these carriers. It
was fortunate for the ladies' happiness
that they had started before
their luggage, for the sight would
have completely spoiled the welcome
one's trunks always receive on their
arrival when you are tempted to part
with them even for a short time&mdash;tender-hearted,
as they certainly
looked, the finery would doubtless
have been left to repose quietly beside
the lake below.
</p>

<p>
The thunder-storm of which we
had heard so much at Vitznau
committed even greater mischief at
Gersau this summer. Two small
streams here unite, and an unusual
mass of water rolling down from
the hillside that night, increased
them to a violent torrent, which
broke down the strong embankment,
carrying all before it&mdash;sweeping
two houses into the lake
and flooding the manufactory to
the first floor. A poor woman
and two children were also drowned;
in fine, the damage done was
very great. There had not been
time for repairs when we visited it,
and the broken walls and scattered
stones told their own tale.
<q>Appeals,</q> too, were hung up on
all sides, but also many notices of
<q>thanks</q> from the commune to
every one who had helped on the
occasion, worded in the same touching
style we had noticed in the
Lucerne papers&mdash;giving a most
agreeable impression of the natural
simplicity and dignity of this small
community. As we steamed away
back again round the Rigi-Nase,
the sun was resting on the pretty
spot, inhabited by the descendants
<pb n='567'/><anchor id='Pg567'/>
of the original hard-working peasants,
and it seemed as if the spirits
of former Camenzinds, Küttels,
and Müllers must look down approvingly
on their posterity, who
are not yet ashamed to profess
their faith, nor unwilling to have
their children still taught how to
unite liberty with religion, and
thus preserve the two treasures intact.
</p>

<p>
Certainly there is no magician
like Apollo&mdash;and none who so well
knows how to make himself valued
by occasional fits of absence. Under
his influence, Vitznau was to-day
another place, an ideal picture
of the stir and movement of modern
life, combined with a tranquil
beauty which we could not have
imagined, veiled in cloud and mist
as it had been on the day before.
It already looked like an old friend,
though only the acquaintance of
one day. There were the curious
engines, showing themselves ready
to brave the dangers of the ascent;
the pretty station with its fruit and
flower girls and photograph stall;
the old church, and the two hotels,
looking bright and clean&mdash;all standing
out in relief against the precipitous
cliff behind, and surrounded
by luxuriant chestnut and walnut
trees, and patches of green,
freshened up by the recent rain.
Even the Nase-promontory was
clothed with timber down to the
shore, and the water reflecting the
trees was only of another lighter
shade, that beautiful transparent
green which is now known as
<q>Eau de Nil.</q> One felt too that
the picture could never be much
spoiled, there being no space for
ugly buildings, or the factory life
which, although it tells of employment
with its own peculiar charms,
rather mars the picturesque beauty
of the landscape at Gersau. Moreover,
the brightness was enhanced
by the national flag of Switzerland
floating over the hotel, looking
more red and striking then ever
against the green background.
Yes! striking is the true word for
it, not showy&mdash;nor flaunting its importance
like the tricolor and
many another particolored standard
of our own days, but solemn
and yet attractive, one quite impossible
not to notice wherever
or however seen. It had always
suggested some history to my mind,
with its white cross on the red
ground, which could not have been
adopted without a purpose, but
since yesterday it had acquired a
new and deep interest, for one of
the pamphlets Herr H&mdash;&mdash; had bestowed
on me in Lucerne treated
of nothing but this same flag. It
was a sermon preached before the
<q>Pius-Verein</q> or <q>Pius Union</q>
of Switzerland, at the general meeting,
which took place at Einsiedlen
in the summer of 1872, entitled
the <q>Wappenschild</q> or
<q>coat-of-arms</q> of the Swiss <q>Pius
Union.</q> During the rain of yesterday
I had read it through, and
most interesting it was to note
the very characteristics he had
foretold that we should observe
pervading all sermons in these
parts: the constant allusions to
their beautiful nature and uninterrupted
reference to their past
history.
</p>

<p>
It commenced by recording how
the <q>Pius-Verein</q> had been founded
in 1854 by some devout Catholics
who could not stand by quietly
noticing the evil tendencies of the
age without protesting, and who
had, in consequence, <q>assembled
on the shore of the tranquil lake of
the Forest Cantons, where 500 years
previously their forefathers had met
together in order to shake off the
<pb n='568'/><anchor id='Pg568'/>
hated yoke of the Austrian governors
and imperial Vogts.</q> It then proceeded
in most eloquent language
to give the reasons why, amongst a
variety of flags, none could be found
which corresponded so completely
to the sentiments of the associates
as the national standard of Switzerland&mdash;the
white cross on the red
ground.
</p>

<p>
<q>The white cross had originally
been chosen,</q> said the preacher,
<q>as being the emblem of purity
and innocence,</q> and the honesty,
uprightness, and union of their ancestors
in that distant age were
forcibly dwelt upon for the imitation
of their descendants, whilst he
drew a lamentable picture of the
divisions and ineffective schemes
of the present day. The second
part explained that these ancestors
had placed this white cross on a
red field&mdash;first, because red, being
the color of blood, was the symbol
of bravery, and was justly claimed
by those same ancestors, who had
made Swiss courage a proverb, and
who had so often shed their hearts'
blood in defence of liberty and of
their faith; for through Christian
liberty alone could civil liberty be
attained. New <q>Vogts</q> or <q>governors,</q>
continued the preacher,
<q rend='pre'>threaten our land nowadays, but
let us manfully resist, and conquer
them. The Lardenberg<note place='foot'>See Zschokke's <hi rend='italic'>History of Switzerland</hi>, page
45, for all these characters in the uprising against
Austria in 1307.</note> of avarice
which formerly seized the oxen
of a poor man, and put his eyes out,
to-day tries to blind the poor by a
godless press and scandalous literature,
robbing them of their most
precious possessions&mdash;of their
churches, convents, priests, and
schools. Let us fight against this
vice in ourselves, in our families
and our communes. Sundays and
holidays displease them, and instead
of church-services and hymns they
wish to hear of nothing but labor
on these days. Let us then be
more strict than ever in the sanctification
of the Sunday, and give
our enemies the example of disinterested
love and charity! The
<q>Wolfenschiess</q> of sensuality and
self-indulgence is more likely to
bring our beloved land under the
slavery of Satan now than 500
years ago&mdash;a worthy undertaking,
therefore, for the <q>Pius-Verein</q>
would be the establishment of
temperance societies.... And
let us courageously fight the third
<q>Landvogt</q>&mdash;the Gessler of luxury,
wealth, and despotism.... Commerce
and industry are the sources
of public prosperity, but let not the
golden calf of gain become the god
of our XIXth century. Let not
our factories become modern
<hi rend='italic'>Zwinglius</hi>, nor their proprietors
force others to bend the knee to
the <hi rend='italic'>hat</hi> of self-interest, nor to offer
up the sacrifice of their freedom
and liberty of speech. The red
field with its white cross will remind
us in all this of our forefathers'
example.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Red</hi>, too, is the color of fire, and
symbolizes love of country. It reminds
us of the fifty men of Schwyz,
who decided the fate of that first
fight for freedom, the great battle
of Morgarten&mdash;of the love of fatherland
shown by an Arnold von
Winkelried, an Adrian von Bubenberg,
a Nicholas von der Flue, and
the many thousand others who left
wife, children, trades, and home, to
seek the death of heroes for love
of country. Compare their conduct
with the boastful toasts of the
present day, and see the difference
between deeds and words. They
reproach us only because we do not
boast with these boasters, and that
<pb n='569'/><anchor id='Pg569'/>
we seek to give our <q>Union</q> a religious
character.... But history
will judge us differently! Let us
on our side show love and charity
to all; to those also who differ from
us in belief; love our confederates
as fellow-Christians; maintain
every bond of union&mdash;and in this
the red ground of the white cross
may be the sign of fraternal love
and harmony.</q>
</p>

<p>
Lastly, the preacher showed how
<q>red typifies the aurora or the
dawn of day,</q> alluding to the
<q>battle near Murten, where, after
a short prayer recited by the combatants,
the sun broke through the
heavy bank of clouds, lighting up
the horizon in brilliant colors, and
their leader, Hans von Hallwyl, exclaimed,
Up, confederates, and forward,
for God lights us to victory!&mdash;a
prophecy which proved
perfectly true. A firm trust and
reliance on the Lord gave soul,
courage, and strength to our ancestors,
and never were they deceived.
God has preserved our fatherland
in a marvellous manner, and why
should we despair? Great should
be our hopes of a better future....
For every reason, then, ought
we to choose the white cross on the
red field as the flag of our Pius-Verein.
Let us show to our Lord and
to the world that we seek nothing for
ourselves, but, treading in the footsteps
of our forefathers, only strive
for the welfare of our fatherland....
God will be with us! and we
shall have the intercession of the
Blessed Virgin Mary, and of the
patrons of our Union, S. Charles
Borromeo and Nicholas von der
Flue.... Let us hold firm to our
glorious faith, and then, when the
sign of the Son of God&mdash;our Holy
cross, our <q>coat-of-arms</q>&mdash;shall
appear amidst the clouds, may it
lead us in triumph on that dreadful
day into the eternal fatherland of
heaven!</q>
</p>

<p>
Fresh from the impression of
these eloquent words, it was impossible
not to look on this beautiful
flag to-day with increasing admiration,
nay affection. But my
reveries were cut short by the
young C&mdash;&mdash;s, whose approaching
railway ascent caused them intense
excitement. George C&mdash;&mdash;, the son,
especially, became full of animation
when he undertook to procure
the tickets for his sisters at the office.
Stationing himself close to the
gangway, he bade them follow at
their leisure, as he would jump on
shore and put his experience of
yesterday's many long hours to
profit. Accordingly, the instant
the steamer came alongside the
quay, he got ahead of all the other
passengers, and giving one bound
to the office, proudly flourished his
tickets for the first carriage to us
who remained on board, long before
the untaught crowd thought
of moving. A few who knew better,
like himself, made a rush too,
and one old man tripped and fell,
whilst another leaped over him,
without allowing himself time to
help his companion&mdash;so selfish does
excitement and locomotion make
all ages and ranks! We likewise
moved on, and so rapidly, that
there was barely time to see the
start of the first train containing
our young friends, who were waving
handkerchiefs to us, as their
carriage seemed to creep above the
church-tower up the mountain, or to
note the fruitful garden-land stretching
along the shore with the precipitous
wall of rock above, extending
the whole length of this side of the
Rigi, when in a few minutes we
reached our landing-place at Weggis,
and found ourselves sitting in
the garden of the <q>Golden Lion.</q>

<head>Odd Stories. VII. The Philosophers Of The Dragon's Bower.</head>

<p>
In the reign of King, and in the
Dragon's Bower of the beautiful
tea-garden of the statesman Kung,
had assembled the philosophers
Tung, Bang, Sing, Lung, Wing,
Hang, with the rich mandarins Bo
and Sho. Sipping that exquisite
beverage which, as yielded by a
choice herb grown only in the
flower-sprinkled garden of Kung, has
imparted to the Hi-Tea philosophy
the peculiar intellectual flavor which
distinguishes it from the Lo-Tea
doctrine, they discussed the problems
of existence. Only a vague,
brief record has been preserved of
that eventful meeting, so well called
by Yung Sing, the poet, <q>the shock
of minds,</q> and which, it was long
maintained by the Hi-Tea school,
had solved the mysteries of preordained
genesis and circumstantial
fixture. The dialogue turned upon
that profound saying of the old man
of Chow, the wise Lautze&mdash;<q>The
Tau which can be tau-ed is not the
eternal Tau.</q> Vainly having sought
in his own poor wit the meaning of
this sublime sentence, the mandarin
Sho begged the six sages, in the
grace of their princely hearts, and
with the light of their shining minds,
to make it clear to his benighted intelligence.
</p>

<p>
<q>In short,</q> added Tung, <q>the
supreme principle Tau is the uncircumscribed
limit of universes;
the order of disorder; the contradiction
which reconciles; the peace
into which all storms subside; the
mother and father of action; the
source of the unworshipped unworshipping
worship, and of power
beyond dominion.</q>
</p>

<p>
The mandarin Sho acknowledged
this to be a grand definition of
Tau; but, being a collector of the
imperial revenues, prayed to be informed
of the use and value of
Tau in the practical administration
of the affairs of men; for to save
his worthless life he could not see
(begging the favor of the assembled
wisdom) how Tau was of any use
whatever. <q>It's of no use,</q> said
Wing; <q>and there's the beauty of
it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then what is the use of
mentioning it?</q> tartly added Hang,
a devoted admirer of the Tau
theory. At this arose an admirable
wrangle over the question of
use and beauty, in that happy
style of wit which only the great
Hi-Tea school of wisdom could
boast. Its upshot was that matter
resolved itself into the final irresponsibility
of all things.
</p>

<p>
<q>But woe to that mortal,</q> said
Tung, <q>who carries not about him
the talisman of wisdom which imparts
<pb n='571'/><anchor id='Pg571'/>
to everything its infinite magic,
and who, groaning in the prison-house
of the senses, sees not
the eternal day-beam in all things.
With eyes he sees not; with life he
lives not. He hath the six becloudings
of Kungfootse.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The wise man,</q> said Bang,
<q>fears no fate. Torrents, tempests,
earthquakes, are but blustering fictions;
nothing is true but his courage.
Fixed in his will, his condition
is victory; and if he falls, he
finds in the elements his kindred,
and in nature his home.</q>
</p>

<p>
Here the countenance of the philosopher
Tung was observed to
change from yellow to pale green,
with signs of great agony caused by
unknown interior workings; for, it
was afterward told, his morning repast
had been poisoned by an ignorant
cook and a bad doctor. Lost
in their thoughts, the sages heeded
not his groans.
</p>

<p>
<q>Always should the sage rejoice,</q>
said Sing. <q>His spirit should take
part in the feast of events, the
sublime comedy of life. Does fortune
desert him? Let him be glad
that it seeks another. Is his friend
dead? Let him be glad that he is
gone to joy. In every event we
can as easily discover reason for
cheer as for despair.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ere Sing had finished speaking,
an ornamented tile from the roof
of the Dragon's Bower, loosened
by one of those disturbances of the
earth not unknown to the learned
men of the East, fell upon the bare
head of the philosopher Bang, who,
after experience of a severe fright,
was borne away helpless from the
scene. Wing smiled, Sing laughed,
and a perceptible scorn was on the
lips of Hang.
</p>

<p>
Thus said Lung, he who had been
called the gaunt thinker: <q>What
think you? Is there anything better
than life, friends? Here we
live, responsible neither to be nor
to do nor to die; life and fate stand
pledged for us. Do we fall out of
the charmed circle? We are caught
up into another. Do we die? Then
we live again; or, if we do not,</q>
continued Lung, gasping, <q>so much
the better. What so excellent as
life; what so merciful as death?</q>
Here a painful fit of coughing compelled
the philosopher to pause.
</p>

<p>
But what now most drew the attention
of the company was the entrance
of the statesman Kung, who,
in a voice of dignified emotion, informed
the wise Sing that his brother
had been suddenly seized and
decapitated on a charge of conspiracy,
and all his immense fortune
confiscated to the state, save a
portion awarded to his betrayer.
Pangs and groans shook the bosom
of the sage, as he left the tea-table;
for his brother's bounty had been
the mainstay of his life.
</p>

<p>
<q>O friends!</q> cried Kung, <q>the
law is inexorable; it kills its child
and devours its mother, and swallows
the substance of its benefactors;
but the state reigns and the king
lives, and the land is happy.
Praised be the king!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Praised be justice!</q> echoed
Hang, who had counselled the astute
Kung in the preparation of his
criminal code. <q>Justice reigns in
King, and acts through Kung.
What is nature but justice, and
what are her thousand-fold accidents
but executioners? Every
man gravitates to his fate, and
every fate is a judgment. The
king makes death: he can do no
wrong; let no man mourn.</q> Long
after the piercing mind of Hang
had perished under the terrors of
that great instrument which his genius
invented for the reform of
mankind; long after the astute
<pb n='572'/><anchor id='Pg572'/>
Kung had yielded up his life to the
demands of state (for he had put to
death by mistake the favorite dog
of his imperial master), these sentences,
which seem to tear to
pieces the leading tenet of the Lo-Tea
doctrines as the dragon tears
the bull, were remembered in the
realm of King.
</p>

<p>
Spake at last that strange sage
whose eyes are as starlight to the
darkness of common minds, and
whose vision seeks the abode of
Tau. <q>Since we but dream we
live,</q> said Wing, <q>let us live to
dream well. In reason are the pillars
of our temple; in imagination
is its worship. Happy are ye who,
out of the toils of vain science and
hard action, take rest in the bower
of fancy, the pavilion of dreams,
the garden of poetry, or roam the
royal hunting-grounds of imagination
to capture logic in the chase
of pleasure, and find wisdom by
seeking delight. Thrice fortunate
ye,</q> continued the star-eyed Wing,
taking another whiff from his pipe
of opium, <q>who, when the caprices
of power have driven you from
doctrine, can retreat upon your
dreams. Life is a fiction; let us
dream that it is the truth.</q> Such
was the curious doctrine of that
wonderful man, whose visions of
demons and the powers of the air
have so often filled the imperial
stage, and who died in the frenzy of
his powerful mind.
</p>

<p>
The refined mandarin Bo&mdash;he who,
for his reticence, had been entrusted
with so many affairs of state&mdash;heard
all these words of the learned, and
spoke not. <q>All men and things,</q>
he said to himself, <q>serve him who
listens, and resist him who talks.
Shrewd is he who gains without
giving.</q> Immersed in these
thoughts, the silent mandarin could
only nod his head to a remark of
the mandarin Sho, that life was a
business of profit and loss, and the
best speculations were always practical.
What man can foretell his
fate? The frank and candid Sho,
whose manners concealed his purpose,
lost his head for speculating
with the king's money. The secret
Bo, through his love of silence, forgot
to send his kinsman Bang a
physician who would have saved
his life, and so was disinherited,
and died a beggar.
</p>

<p>
The thinkers of Lo-Tea, having
taken the measure of these and
other events subsequent to the great
dialogue of the Dragon's Bower,
could not avoid the boast that their
humble philosophy was better than
a proud one; whereupon the infuriated
statesman Kung sent a number
of them into exile.
</p>

<p>
When the old philosopher of
Chow heard of these sayings and
doings, he murmured: <q>Half-truths
are contradicted, whole truths are
verified. There is no courage
without right fear; no good silence
without true speech; no aspiration
without reverence; no dignity without
humility; no good without
affection; and philosophy has no
room for a cold heart and a vain
mind. But life is not contradicted,
though lives are slain. Tau
reigns.</q>
</p>

<p>
O sages! how by thinking shall
ye add a foot to your stature? And
how shall it avail ye when a brick,
as it were, dropped down by a tornado
centre-wise, so to speak, on
a shaven head, shall fracture your
systems of philosophy? What
withstands the accidents of fate
save the divine Truth, which is no
accident?

<p>
The Catherines are a wonderful group

Genoa was a married lady, and this circumstance
will undoubtedly make her
<hi rend='italic'>Life</hi> doubly interesting to those who are
in the same condition, and sometimes are
tempted to envy those who live in the
cloister. The remarkable <hi rend='italic'>Life</hi> of this
saint, accompanied by her <hi rend='italic'>Spiritual Dialogues</hi>,
now first published in English,
will have an additional interest, in the
eyes of all its readers, on account of the
introduction by F. Hecker, which is dated
Annecy, Oct. 7, 1873. The translation
was made several years ago, and left, in
the state of a rough draught, by a lady
well known for her high culture and virtues&mdash;the
late Mrs. Ripley. It has been
lately revised with care, and made as accurate
as possible.
</p>

<p>
The work itself has long been very
famous, and ranks next to the writings
of S. Teresa among the spiritual treatises
of female authors. Its spirituality is of a
very high order, suited for those who,
either from necessity or by their own free
choice, are trying to climb the rugged
heights of Mount Carmel.

<p>
Mgr. Gaume attacks, with his usual
trenchant vigor and sarcasm, in this volume,
the horrible travesty of funeral obsequies
which atheists are wont to perpetrate
at the burial of what they regard
as mere clods of earth, the carcases of
dead animals. These enemies of the
human race are not content with the enjoyment
of the civil right to live and die
like beasts themselves, but they must
needs attempt to desecrate the cemeteries
of Christians, and to interfere with their
right to live and die, and be buried like
rational and immortal beings who expect
a resurrection from the dead. It is highly
important that the eyes of all men who
have any glimmering of reason and religious
belief left should be opened to
the loathsome wickedness and brutality
of the sect of atheists and communists
who are everywhere conspiring for the
destruction of society and the human
race. This book will serve as an eye-opener
to all who read it attentively.
We trust it will also act as an antidote to
the heathenish and revolting notions respecting
the burning of the bodies of the
dead which have of late been so offensively
presented in many newspapers.
</p>

<p>
The book has been well translated and
neatly printed. We cannot, however, admire
the grave-yard view on the cover,
which reminds us of the car-doors on the
Camden and Amboy Railway, with a
grave-stone and a weeping-willow.

Hon. Lord Robert Montagu, M.P.
London: Burns &amp; Oates. 1874. (For
sale by The Catholic Publication Society.)
</p>

</quote>

<p>
The popular errors attacked and refuted
in this collection of essays are such
as relate to political ethics, the mutual
bearings of religion and law, church and
state, civil marriage, education&mdash;in a
word, they are the errors of the party of
<pb n='574'/><anchor id='Pg574'/>
revolution, the so-called principles of
1789. Lord Robert Montagu has made
a work by F. Franco, S.J., the basis of his
own, which is neither, strictly speaking,
original, nor yet a translation or compendium
of F. Franco's work. The Protestant
and secular papers are just now
peculiarly inquisitive about the doctrines
of sound and instructed Catholics on
these mixed questions. It is not very
easy to satisfy them by mere newspaper
and magazine articles written in haste
and under the pressure of editorial labors.
Here is a book where they may find the
information they are in quest of, and
where Catholics also may gain much instruction.
We have no reason to wish
to withhold the full, clear, and unreserved
statement of our Catholic doctrines on
any subject from our non-Catholic fellow-citizens.
The great difficulty lies in the
universal confusion of ideas on these
subjects, and the general want of willingness
to inquire and discuss thoroughly
and fairly. The European Catholic press
is fairly teeming with books and articles
of the most consummate ability on these
burning questions of the day, and we
welcome every effort made by those who
write in English to place these products
of sound learning and thought before
our own reading public. This book is
an effort of that kind, and we hope it will
be read by a great number of both Catholics
and non-Catholics who wish to inform
themselves about the true issues
between the church on one side, Cæsarism
and revolution on the other.

</p>

</quote>

<p>
As a specimen of the typographical art,
this book is superb. The literary taste
and skill exhibited in its preparation are
also of a high order. Its contents are,
moreover, specimens of the productions
of genius and wisdom gathered from all
time and all cultivated nations, including
many passages from the inspired writings.
So far, the book is one which may be valuable
to one who knows how to use it,
and is competent to discriminate between
the truth and the error which it contains.
Nevertheless, the intention of the author
and the real scope of the volume are
radically anti-Christian and anti-theistic.
The very idea of presenting a conglomeration
of the Divine Scriptures and of
the sacred writings, legends, and philosophical
works of heathens, is to place all
religions on a common level. In the
index the author, with the pert assumption
of a neological sciolist, takes care to
assert as a fact the want of genuineness
and authenticity of a great part of the
books of the Bible. As a mere opinion,
this is in defiance of sound criticism, and
has been often exploded. To put forward
such an opinion, in defiance of the learning
of the whole Christian world, as something
certain and unquestionable, is simple
impudence, and is as unscientific as
it is irreligious. In the extracts on theism
the author has adroitly given the
whole a pantheistic issue.
</p>

<p>
The ignorant, the unwary, and those
who wish to escape from the sense of responsibility
to God may be deceived by
this kind of art. But really, and in the
view of a true and comprehensive science,
all that can be gathered from false religions
and imperfect philosophies, both in
those things which resemble, and those
which are partly or wholly dissimilar to,
the divine philosophy of revelation and
Christian theology, confirms and proves
the divine truth of the Old and New
Testaments and the concurrent religious
tradition of the church of God from the
creation of man. Proudhon was right
when he said that a man who is logical
must be an atheist or an ultramontane.
Whoever stands by what is positive, and
is ready to follow it to its consequences,
belongs logically to the Catholic side.
Whoever takes the negative belongs with
atheists and materialists. One sad and
startling proof that the great mass of those
who reject the Catholic Church, and yet
are not ready to renounce the name of
Christian, are sliding downward, is the
multiplication of books like this one, and
much worse than this, published by our
principal firms, and everywhere advertised
along with works professedly Christian
and pious. We suppose that most
of these gentlemen profess to be Christians.
Where is their conscience, then,
when, for the sake of money, they disseminate
the works of Renan, Strauss, Büchner,
and other infidels and atheists, which
are sapping the foundations of religion
and morality, and poisoning the public
mind? Where is the public conscience
<pb n='575'/><anchor id='Pg575'/>
which tolerates this? And why do not
the Protestant periodicals, newspapers,
synods and conventions, pulpits and lecturing
rostrums, resound with a cry of
alarm, warning and denunciation? Have
they lost all interest and all courage
in the matter, or are they going over to
the enemy?

<p>
Gregory the Great is illustrious among
the popes, and even among the doctors
of the church, for his genius. There is
an exquisite flavor in his writings which
is peculiar to them. Edited and published
with the utmost care and the most
perfect literary taste, like all the books of
this series, this volume adds one more
gem to the treasury of English Catholic
literature which is now so rapidly filling
up. The publication of entire works of
the fathers presents the evidences of the
Catholic religion in the most convincing
form, and is therefore a way of propagating
the faith in some respects superior
to the ordinary method of controversy.
It is also most valuable for Catholics as
a means of increasing and deepening
their knowledge of our holy faith. It is
to be hoped that a taste for books of this
description will become more general
among reading Catholics, and that all
who have the means of doing so will in
every way promote their general circulation.

This is the first instalment of what promises
to be a valuable work, and one
which has been much needed. The treatises
on moral theology hitherto in use
in this country are, with the exception of
Archbishop Kenrick's, which is not in a
very convenient form for a text-book, of
European origin, and are unsatisfactory
in America both by excess and defect.
In this first part of F. Koning's work,
containing the treatises, <q>De Actibus
Humanis, de Conscientia, de Legibus,
de Peccatis, de Virtutibus,</q> there is not,
of course, so much opportunity for the
introduction of matter peculiar to this
country as in those which will follow.
The objection may be made to the book
that the various opinions of theologians
are not always given on controverted
points; but this is unavoidable
in a treatise merely intended as an exponent
of S. Alphonsus. The system advocated
is that of equiprobabilism.

<head>Matter.</head>

<p>
Much as has been written on
matter by ancient and modern
philosophers, the last word about
its constitution has not yet been
said. The old school of metaphysicians,
in spite of its high intellectual
attainments, could not unravel
this perplexing subject, because it
had not a sufficient knowledge of
natural facts. The modern scientist,
on the other hand, in spite of
his vast knowledge of facts, can
never reach the ultimate consequences
implied in them, because he is
too little acquainted with the old
principles of philosophical speculation.
For, as all the questions connected
with the constitution of matter
are of a metaphysical character,
purely experimental science cannot
answer them; it can only supply
materials to the philosopher for
their solution. In the study of
natural philosophy observation
picks up the spontaneous revelations
of nature, experiment verifies
and controls the results of observation
by compelling nature to act
under definite conditions, and speculation
discovers the relations intervening
between effects and effects,
as also between effects and
causes, thus paving the way to the
determination of the nature of
causes from the nature of their effects.
</p>

<p>
We are of opinion that the scientific
materials gathered from observation
and experiment since the
discovery of universal attraction
are quite sufficient for the purpose
of determining the constitution of
matter; and we presume that, under
the guidance of positive science,
we may safely engage in a full philosophical
investigation of this interesting
subject. We are not ignorant
that the treatment of this
great question has always presented,
and still presents, many difficulties
and dangers, against which
proper precautions are to be taken.
Sometimes the phenomena on
which our reasonings must be based
are so complex that it might be
doubted whether they reveal more
than they mask the truths which
we aspire to discover. Again, we
<pb n='578'/><anchor id='Pg578'/>
are very easily misled by the outward
appearance of things, and
blinded in a measure by deep-rooted
prejudices of our infancy, which,
besides being shared by all classes
of persons, have in their favor the
almost irrefragable sanction of the
popular language. Moreover, many
conflicting hypotheses have been
advanced by philosophers of different
schools in their attempt at solving
the questions concerning the
nature of material things; and thus
the subject of our discussion comes
before us with an accompaniment
of many elaborate theories, old and
new, which it becomes our duty to
subject to a careful criticism, lest
they overcloud the intellect and
obstruct our vision of truth. Fortunately,
however, as we shall see
in the sequel, only three of those
theories can be considered to have
a real claim to the attention of the
modern philosopher, and each of
them, by proper management, can
be made to yield a fair portion of
truth.
</p>

<p>
We propose to commence with
the consideration of those natural
facts from which the true nature
and the essential constitution of
material substance can be most
easily ascertained. We shall then
determine accurately the essence
of matter, examine its constituents
in particular, and point out their
necessary relations, according to
the scholastic method. And, lastly,
we shall inquire what, in the light
of modern science, must be the
philosophical theory of the generation
and corruption of material
compounds.
</p>

<div>
<head>I.</head>

<div>
<head>Existence of matter.</head>

<p>
The first
foundation of what we shall say
hereafter is that matter, or material
substance, really exists. By <q>matter</q>
we mean a being which is the
proper subject of local motion, or
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Ens mobile</foreign>, as the ancient philosophers
define it. Hence, if there is
local motion, there is matter. And
since local motion is undeniable,
the existence of matter is equally
undeniable.
</p>

<p>
It is all very well for the idealist
to say that we perceive nothing but
phenomena. Local movement, of
course, is only a phenomenon; but
evidently such a phenomenon
would be impossible, if nothing existed
which could receive local motion.
But that which can receive
local motion we call matter. And
therefore what we call matter is
something real in the world.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>Origin of matter.</head>

<p>
Democritus,
Epicurus, and other pagan philosophers
taught that matter is eternal
and uncreated. This old error has
been utterly dispelled by the light
of Christian philosophy; yet it has
been lately revived, and is studiously
propagated in our own days by a set
of infidel scribblers, who pretend,
in the name of science, to do away
with what they call the obsolete
notion of a Creator. It may therefore
be useful to say here a few
words about the contingency and
the creation of matter. We have
already shown, in an article on the
extrinsic principles of being,<note place='foot'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Catholic World</hi> for February, 1874, p. 584.</note> that
the changeableness of a thing is a
sufficient proof of its coming out
of nothing, inasmuch as nothingness
is the true extrinsic principle
of passivity and potentiality. As
matter is evidently passive and potential,
it directly follows that matter
has come out of nothing.
</p>

<p>
But since unbelievers are not philosophers,
though they call themselves
so, and may not be able to
realize the value of an argument
based on metaphysical grounds,
<pb n='579'/><anchor id='Pg579'/>
and since we hear them repeat without
end that science&mdash;their degraded
science&mdash;has done away with
the old dream of creation, we deem
it expedient to appeal to science itself,
and bring forward from it a
clear proof of the fact of creation.
This proof is to be found in the
very constitution of the primitive
molecules of bodies, as Prof. Clerk-Maxwell
has recently shown in a
very remarkable lecture on molecules.<note place='foot'>A lecture <hi rend='italic'>On Molecules</hi>, delivered before the
British Association at Bradford, by Prof. Clerk-Maxwell,
F.R.S. <hi rend='italic'>Nature</hi>, September 25, 1873.</note>
His scientific argument is
contained in the following passage:
</p>

<p>
<q>The molecule, though indestructible,
is not a hard, rigid body,
but is capable of internal movements,
and, when these are excited, it emits
rays, the wave-length of which is
a measure for the time of vibration
of a molecule. By means of the
spectroscope the wave-length of
different kinds of light may be compared
to within one ten-thousandth
part. In this way it has been ascertained
not only that molecules
taken from every specimen of hydrogen
in our laboratories have the
same set of periods of vibration,
but that light having the same set
of periods of vibration is emitted
from the sun and from the fixed
stars. We are thus assured that
molecules of the same nature as
those of our hydrogen exist in those
distant regions, or at least did exist
when the light by which we
see them was emitted.... Light,
which is to us the sole evidence of
the existence of these distant worlds,
tells us also that each of them is
built of molecules of the same kind
as those which we find on earth.
A molecule of hydrogen, for example,
whether in Sirius or Arcturus,
executes its vibrations in precisely
the same time. Each molecule,
therefore, throughout the universe,
bears impressed on it the stamp
of a metric system as distinctly as
does the metre of the Archives of
Paris or the double royal cubit of
the temple of Karnac. No theory
of evolution can be formed to account
for the similarity of molecules;
for evolution necessarily implies
continuous change, and the
molecule is incapable of growth or
decay, of generation or destruction.
None of the processes of nature,
since the time when nature began,
have produced the slightest difference
in the properties of any molecule.
We are therefore unable to
ascribe either the existence of the
molecules or the identity of their
properties to the operation of any
of the causes which we call natural.
On the other hand, the exact equality
of each molecule to all others
of the same kind gives it, as Sir
John Herschel has well said, the essential
character of a manufactured
article, and precludes the idea of
its being eternal and self-existent.
Thus we have been led, along a
strictly scientific path, very near to
the point at which science must
stop. Not that science is debarred
from studying the internal mechanism
of a molecule which she cannot
take to pieces, any more than
from investigating an organism
which she cannot put together.
But in tracing back the history of
matter science is arrested when she
assures herself, on the one hand,
that the molecule has been made,
and, on the other, that it has
not been made by any of the processes
we call natural. Science is
incompetent to reason upon the
creation of matter itself out of
nothing.<note place='foot'>It is competent, however, to furnish the philosopher
with all the materials of such a reasoning,
as this very passage clearly shows.</note> We have reached the
<pb n='580'/><anchor id='Pg580'/>
utmost limit of our thinking faculties
when we have admitted that,
because matter cannot be eternal
and self-existent, it must have been
created. That matter, as such,
should have certain fundamental
properties, that it should exist in
space and be capable of motion,
that its motion should be persistent,
and so on, are truths which may,
for anything we know, be of the
kind which metaphysicians call
necessary. We may use our knowledge
of such truths for purposes
of deduction, but we have no data
for speculating as to their origin.
But that there should be exactly so
much matter and no more in every
molecule of hydrogen is a fact of a
very different order.... Natural
causes, as we know, are at work,
which tend to modify, if they do
not at length destroy, all the arrangements
and dimensions of the
earth, and of the whole solar system.
But though, in the course of
ages, catastrophes have occurred,
and may yet occur, in the heavens;
though ancient systems may be dissolved,
and new systems evolved
out of their ruins, the molecules
out of which those systems are
built, the foundation-stones of the
material universe, remain unbroken
and unworn. They continue to
this day as they were created, perfect
in number and measure and
weight, and from the ineffaceable
characters impressed on them we
may learn that those aspirations
after accuracy in measurement,
truth in statement, and justice in
action, which we reckon among our
noblest attributes as men, are ours
because they are essential constituents
of the image of Him who, in
the beginning, created not only the
heaven and the earth, but the materials
of which heaven and earth
consist.</q>
</p>

<p>
Such is the verdict of true science
as interpreted by the eminent
English mathematician and natural
philosopher. The whole is so instructive
and interesting that we
think we have no need of apologizing
for the length of the quotation.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>Essential properties of matter.</head>

<p>
The
constituents of things are revealed
to us by their properties.
For, as every being acts according
as it is in act, and suffers according
as it is in potency, from the
activity and the passivity with
which a being is endowed we can
easily find out the special nature
of the act and of the potency
which constitute its metaphysical
essence. Hence, if we wish to ascertain
the essential constitution
of material substance, we must first
ascertain and thoroughly understand
the properties which are
common to all material substances,
and without which no material
substance can be conceived. In
doing this we must guard against
confounding, as many scientists do,
the essential properties of matter
with the general properties of bodies.
Extension, impenetrability,
divisibility, porosity, etc., are general
properties of bodies; but it
does not follow that they are essential
properties of material substance
as such, as they may arise
from accidental composition. Those
properties alone are essential
which are altogether primitive,
unchangeable, and involved in the
principles of the substance; and
such properties, as we shall see, are,
so far as material substance is concerned,
the three following: <hi rend='italic'>active
power</hi> to produce local motion, <hi rend='italic'>passivity</hi>
for receiving local motion,
and <hi rend='italic'>inertia</hi>. These three properties
correspond to the three constituents
of material substance.
</p>

<p>
There are philosophers who deny
<pb n='581'/><anchor id='Pg581'/>
that material things have any active
power. They know that matter is
inert, and they cannot see how
activity can be reconciled with
inertia. There are others, on the
contrary, who, for a similar reason,
being unable to deny the activity
of bodies, deny their inertia. From
what we are going to say it will
be manifest that these philosophers
have never known exactly what is
meant in natural science by the
inertia of matter.
</p>

<p>
Other writers, especially those of
the old school, while admitting the
three essential properties of matter
which we have just mentioned, contend
that material substance has a
fourth important and connatural,
if not essential, property&mdash;viz., <hi rend='italic'>continuous
extension</hi>&mdash;without which,
they say, nothing material can be
conceived. They further teach,
and would fain have us believe,
that all material substance is endowed
with extension and resistance;
and many of them think
that extension and resistance constitute
the essence of matter. This
last opinion is very common among
philosophical writers, and deserves
the most careful examination, as it
bears very heavily on an essential
point of the controversy in which
we have to engage.
</p>

<p>
Let us see, then, first, what we
have to think regarding the activity,
the passivity, and the inertia of
matter; and, when we have done
with these, we shall take up the
question of material continuity, of
which we hope to give a full analysis
and a satisfactory solution.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>Activity, passivity, and inertia.</head>

<p>
The
special character by which the
phenomena of the material world
are recognized consists in their being
brought about by local motion.
For it is a well-known fact that in
things purely material no change
takes place but through local movements;
so that we cannot even conceive
a change in the material
world without a displacement of
matter. Hence all the actions of
matter upon matter tend to produce
local movement, or to modify it;
and all passion of the matter acted
on is a reception of movement.
</p>

<p>
That all material substances possess
activity, passivity, and inertia
is quite certain on experimental
grounds. No conclusion is better
established in science than that all
the particles of matter act on one
another according to a fixed law,
and receive from one another their
determination to move from place
to place, while they are incapable
of setting themselves in movement
or modifying the movement received
from without. Now, it is clear
that they cannot act without being
<hi rend='italic'>active</hi>, nor receive the action without
being <hi rend='italic'>passive</hi>, nor be incapable
of modifying their own state without
being <hi rend='italic'>inert</hi>.
</p>

<p>
This shows that activity and
inertia do not exclude one another.
A particle of matter is said to be
active inasmuch as it has the power
of causing the movement of any
other particle; and is said to be
inert inasmuch as it has no power
of giving movement to itself. It is
plain that these two things are very
far from being contradictory. Those
philosophers, therefore, who have
apprehended an irreconcilable opposition
between the two, must
have attached to the term <q>inertia</q>
a meaning quite different from that
recognized by physical science.
</p>

<p>
Balmes remarks, in his <hi rend='italic'>Fundamental
Philosophy</hi>,<note place='foot'>Book 10, ch. 15.</note> that there is nothing
perfectly still either on earth
or in the heavens; and for this
reason he expresses the opinion
<pb n='582'/><anchor id='Pg582'/>
that all bodies have a constant
tendency to move. And as he cannot
see how such a tendency can
be reconciled with the inertia of
matter, he comes to the conclusion
that bodies are not inert. But it is
scarcely necessary to remark that
the constant tendency to move
which we observe in bodies is the
result of universal attraction, and
not of a self-acting power inhering
in the matter of which the bodies
consist; and therefore such a tendency
does not in the least interfere
with the inertia of matter. A
simple reference to the laws of
motion suffices to convince the
most superficial student that such
is the case.
</p>

<p>
Malebranche goes to the other
extreme. He supposes that bodies
have no activity of any kind, and
that accordingly all the phenomena
we witness in the physical world
are produced by God alone. This
theory, as every one will acknowledge,
is supremely extravagant and
unphilosophical. It leads to idealism
and to pantheism. To idealism,
because, if bodies do not act,
there is no reason why they should
exist; as nothing can be admitted
to exist throughout creation which
has no aptitude to manifest in its
own reality a reflex of the Creator's
perfections. And since manifestation
is action, no created being can
be destitute of active power. This
argument drawn from the end of
creation may be supplemented by
another drawn from the impossibility
of our knowing the existence of
bodies if they do not act. For, if
bodies do not act on our senses,
we cannot refer to bodies for the
causality of our sensations; and
thus the only link by which we
have the means of connecting our
subjective impressions with exterior
objects will be destroyed.
</p>

<p>
Hence, if bodies are not active,
there is no reason why they should
be admitted to exist, and we are accordingly
condemned to an absurd
idealism. Nor can we escape pantheism.
For, if the impressions we
receive from outside are caused by
God alone, we cannot but conclude
that whatever we see outside of us
has no other objectivity than that
of the divine substance itself appearing
under different forms.
Now, this is a pantheistic doctrine.
Therefore the theory which denies
the activity of bodies leads to pantheism.
We will say nothing more
about this preposterous doctrine
and its absurd consequences. Plain
common sense, without need of
further argument, condemns whatever
calls in question the reality
and objectivity of our knowledge
concerning the exterior world.
</p>

<p>
But, while we admit with all the
physicists, and indeed with all mankind,
that material substance is
competent, through its natural activity,
to cause local motion, we
must guard against the opinion of
the materialists, who pretend that
the active power of matter is also
competent, under certain conditions
and through certain combinations,
to produce thought. Nothing,
perhaps, can be more inconsistent
with reason than this assumption.
Were matter not inert,
the hypothesis might deserve examination;
but an <hi rend='italic'>inert</hi> thinking
substance is such an enormity
that it cannot, even hypothetically,
be entertained. The thinking faculty
evidently implies self-acting
power, whereas inertia evidently
excludes it; and therefore, so long
as we keep in mind that matter is
inert, we cannot, without evident
inconsistency, extend the range of
its activity to immanent operations,
but must confine it to the extrinsic
<pb n='583'/><anchor id='Pg583'/>
production of local motion. Let
us here remark that, of all the arguments
usually employed in psychology
against the materialistic
hypothesis, this one drawn from the
inertia of matter is the most valuable
as it is the most simple and incontrovertible.
</p>

<p>
The inertia of matter is so universally
admitted that it is hardly
necessary to say a word about it.
No fact, indeed, is more certain in
science than that matter, when at
rest, cannot but remain so until it
receive from without a determination
to move; and likewise that,
when determined to move with any
velocity and in any direction, it
cannot but move with that velocity
and in that direction until it receive
some other determination from
without. This incapability of
changing its own state constitutes,
as we have already stated, the inertia
of matter, and is the very foundation
of mechanical science.
</p>

<p>
As to the natural passivity of material
substance, we need only say
that it consists in its capability of
receiving, when it is acted on, any
accidental determination to move
in any direction and with any velocity.
That matter has this passivity
is an obvious experimental
truth; and that matter has no other
passivity except this one we shall
prove in another place.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, it is evident from
the preceding considerations that all
matter is active, passive, and inert.
The principle of activity, in every being,
is its essential act, and the principle
of passivity its essential term,
which is a real passive potency;<note place='foot'>See <hi rend='smallcaps'>Catholic World</hi>, March, 1874, p. 827.</note>
hence the activity and the passivity
of matter are a necessary result of the
essential constitution of material substance,
and are therefore <emph>essential</emph>
properties of the same. The inertia
of matter is also a necessary result
of the essential constitution of
material substance; for the only
reason why an element of matter
cannot give motion to itself is to
be found in the mutual relation of
its essential principles, which is of
such a nature that the principle of
passivity cannot be influenced by
any exertion of the active principle,
of which it is the intrinsic term.
Now, this relation, for which we
shall fully account hereafter, belongs
to the essence of the substance
as truly and as necessarily
as the essential principles themselves.
Hence the inertia of matter
is an <emph>essential</emph> property of matter
no less than its activity and
passivity.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>Action at a distance.</head>

<p>
The activity
of material substance is a very
interesting subject of investigation;
its nature, its mode of working, the
law of its exertion, and the conditions
on which the production of
its effects depends, give rise to
many important questions, which,
owing to philosophical discords,
have not yet received a satisfactory
solution. The first of these questions
is: <hi rend='italic'>Does material substance act
at a distance, or does it require, as a
condition sine qua non for acting, a
mathematical contact of its matter
with the matter acted upon?</hi>
</p>

<p>
Philosophers and scientists have
often examined this grave subject,
but their opinions are still divided.
Those philosophers who form
their physical views from the scholastic
system, commonly hold that
a true material contact is an indispensable
condition for the action
of matter upon matter, and think it
to be an evident truth. But physicists,
<q>with few exceptions,</q> as
Prof. Faraday remarks, admit that
all action of matter upon matter is
<pb n='584'/><anchor id='Pg584'/>
an <hi rend='italic'>actio in distans</hi>, and he himself
supports the same doctrine, although
suggesting that it should be
expressed in somewhat different
terms. We propose to show that
this latter solution is the only one
consistent with the principles both
of science and of philosophy. And
as the opposite view owes its origin,
and in a great measure its
plausibility, to the known theory
of kinetic forces as deduced from
the impact of bodies, we shall argue
from the same theory in support
of our conclusion.
</p>

<p>
Here is our argument. When a
body impinges upon another body,
if any communication of movement
is made by a true and immediate
contact of matter with matter, its
duration must be limited to that
indivisible instant of time in which
the distance between the struggling
particles of matter becomes = 0.
But in an indivisible instant of time
no finite velocity can be communicated.
And therefore no real
movement can be caused in the impact
of bodies by a true and immediate
contact of matter with matter.
</p>

<p>
We think that this argument admits
of no reply. Its major proposition
is the statement of an obvious
geometric truth. Nor can it
be gainsaid by assuming that the
duration of the action can be prolonged;
for the action, in the opinion
of those against whom we now
are arguing, is supposed to require
true material contact; and it is
plain that two particles of matter
coming into contact cannot remain
in contact for any length of time,
however inappreciable, unless in
the very first instant of their meeting
their velocities have become
equal; it being evident that two
particles of matter animated by different
velocities cannot preserve
for any length of time the same relation
in space. To assume, therefore,
that the contact can be prolonged,
is to assume that from the
very first instant of the collision
the unequal velocities of the struggling
particles have been equalized,
or, in other terms, that the velocity
imparted has been communicated
in the very first instant of the impact.
But if so, then the assumption
of a prolonged contact, as a
means of communicating the velocity,
is altogether useless, and involves
an evident contradiction.
It is therefore necessary to concede
that, if the velocity is communicated
by a true and immediate contact
of matter with matter, the communication
must be made in an indivisible
instant of time.
</p>

<p>
The minor proposition of our
syllogism is equally evident. For
it is one of the fundamental axioms
of mechanics that actions, all other
things being equal, are proportional
to their respective duration;
whence it is plain that an action
of which the duration is infinitesimal
cannot produce more than an
infinitesimal effect. And therefore
no finite velocity can be produced
by true material contact.
</p>

<p>
Against this argument four objections
may be advanced: First,
that although in the contact of one
point with another point no finite
velocity can be communicated, yet
in the case of a multitude of material
points coming into collision
the effect might be appreciable.
Secondly, that a particle of matter
may be carried straight away by
another particle which impinges
upon it with sufficient velocity.
Thirdly, that a distinction is to be
made between continuous and instantaneous
actions, and that, although
a continuous action produces
an effect proportional to its
<pb n='585'/><anchor id='Pg585'/>
duration, as in the case of universal
attraction, yet instantaneous
actions, as in the case of impact,
may not necessarily follow the
same law. Lastly, that even admitting
the impossibility of producing
finite velocity in an infinitesimal
unit of time, yet finite velocity
might still be <emph>communicated</emph> in an
infinitesimal unit of time without
any new production, as modern
scientists assume.
</p>

<p>
To the first objection we answer
that, if each material point cannot,
in the instant of the contact, acquire
more than an infinitesimal
velocity, the whole multitude will
have only an infinitesimal velocity;
and thus no movement will ensue.
</p>

<p>
To the second we answer that
a particle cannot be carried straight
away unless it receives a communication
of finite velocity; and such
a communication, as we have already
shown, cannot be made in
the instant of the contact.
</p>

<p>
The third objection we answer
by denying that there is any rigorously
instantaneous action. When
physicists speak of <q>instantaneous</q>
actions, they mean actions having
a finite duration, which, however,
is so short that it cannot be appreciated
or measured by our means
of observation. And therefore
what is called an <q>instantaneous</q>
action is nothing but a continuous
action of a short duration.
Now, a difference of duration is
not a difference in kind; and accordingly,
if actions are proportional
to their duration when their duration
is longer, they are no less so
when their duration is shorter.
</p>

<p>
The last objection takes for
granted that there can be a communication
of velocity without production
of velocity; which amounts
to saying that the velocity of the
impinging body is transmitted <emph>identically</emph>
to the body impinged upon.
This is, however, a mere delusion.
The velocity acquired by the
body impinged upon has no previous
existence in the impinging
body; and accordingly its
communication implies its real
production, as we have proved in
one of our past articles.<note place='foot'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Catholic World</hi>, March, 1874, page 759.</note>
</p>

<p>
The <hi rend='italic'>actio in distans</hi> can also be
proved from the very nature of
material activity. It is generally
admitted that the active power of
matter is either attractive or repulsive;
for all men of science agree
that the movements of the material
world are brought about by attractions
and repulsions. Now, attraction
and repulsion do not imply
a material contact between the
agent and the patient, but, on the
contrary, exclude it; and therefore
all the movements of the material
world are due to actions at a distance.
That attraction excludes
material contact is quite evident,
for attraction produces movement
by causing the approach of one
body to another; and it is evident
that no approach will be possible
if the bodies are already in immediate
contact. It is therefore an essential
condition for the possibility
of attraction that the agent be not
in immediate contact with the
patient. And as for repulsion, it is
known that it serves to keep the
molecules of a body distant from
one another, and consequently it is
exercised at molecular distances.
This is especially evident in the
case of elastic fluids. For repulsion
obtains among the molecules
of such fluids, whether the said
molecules be pressed nearer or let
further apart. And therefore repulsion,
too, is exercised without
material contact.
</p>

<pb n='586'/><anchor id='Pg586'/>

<p>
Some modern physicists try to
do away with repulsion, and explain
the pressure exercised by
a gas against the vessel in which
it is confined by saying that the
gaseous molecules are continually
flying about in all directions, and
continually impinging on the interior
surface of the recipient, where
their excursions are intercepted,
and that this continuous series of
impacts constitutes what we call
the pressure of the gas on the vessel.
</p>

<p>
But this new theory cannot bear
one moment's examination. It is
wholly gratuitous; it disregards mechanical
principles by admitting
that the movement of the molecules
can go on unabated in spite
of repeated impacts, and it assumes
that the momentum of a moving
molecule is its active power; which
is utterly false, as we will show later.
</p>

<p>
Other physicists have tried to get
rid of attraction, also, by assuming
that those effects which we ascribe
to attraction are to be attributed to
ethereal pressure. This hypothesis
has no better foundation than
the preceding one, and is equally
untenable for many reasons which
we shall explain hereafter.
</p>

<p>
The <hi rend='italic'>actio in distans</hi> can also be
directly proved by the consideration
of statical forces. We know
that the action which tends to communicate
movement in a given
direction cannot be frustrated or
neutralized, except by an action of
the same intensity applied in an
opposite direction. It is evident,
on the other hand, that, if the first
requires an immediate contact of
matter with matter, the second also
must be subject to the same condition.
Now, this latter is altogether
independent of such a condition.
Accordingly, the former also&mdash;that
is, the action which tends to communicate
the movement&mdash;is independent
of a true material contact.
</p>

<p>
The minor proposition of this
syllogism may be proved as follows:
Let a small cube of hard steel
be placed on a smooth, horizontal
plate of cast-iron lying on a table.
The cube will remain at rest on
the plate, notwithstanding the action
of gravity upon it, because,
while the cube tends to fall and
presses the plate, the action of the
plate frustrates that tendency, and
keeps the equilibrium. Now, the
cube and the plate do not immediately
touch one another with their
matter; for we know that they can
be brought nearer than they are.
We may place, for instance, a second
cube on the top of the first,
and thus increase the pressure on
the plate, and cause the plate itself
to react with an increased intensity.
But it is obvious that neither of the
two actions can become intenser,
unless the cube is brought nearer
to the plate; for the resistance of
the plate cannot be modified, unless
some of the previous conditions
be altered; and since the
two surfaces have remained the
same, no other condition can be
conceived to be changed except
their relative distance. It is therefore
a change, and in fact a diminution,
of the distance between the
cube and the plate that entails the
change of the action. Whence we
see that, even in the case of the so-called
<emph>physical</emph> contact, bodies do
not touch one another with their
matter. This shows that physical
contact does not exclude distance;
and therefore, when we say that
two bodies touch one another, the
fact we express is that the two
bodies are so near to one another
that <hi rend='italic'>they cannot approach nearer
<pb n='587'/><anchor id='Pg587'/>
without their molecular arrangement
being disturbed by their mutual actions</hi>.
Therefore the hypothesis
that a true material contact of matter
with matter is needed for causing
or for hindering movement is
irreconcilable with fact.
</p>

<p>
As a further development of this
proof, we may add that one of the
necessary conditions for the equilibrium
of the cube on the plate is,
that the action of the plate have a
direction opposite to the action of
the cube. Now, no direction whatever
can be conceived but between
two distinct, and therefore distant,
points. Accordingly, there cannot
be the least doubt that all the
points belonging to the surface of
the plate are really distant from
those of the neighboring surface of
the cube. Whence we conclude
again that their mutual action is
exercised at a distance.
</p>

<p>
Other proofs of the same truth
might be drawn, if necessary, from
other considerations. Faraday, from
the phenomena of electric conduction,
was led to the conclusion that
each atom of matter, though occupying
a mere point in space, has a
sphere of action extending throughout
the whole solar system.<note place='foot'>See <hi rend='italic'>A Speculation touching Electric Conduction
and the Nature of Matter</hi>.</note> Boscovich,<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Theoria Philosophiæ Naturalis</hi> p. 1, n. 18.</note>
from the law of continuity,
demonstrates that movement is not
communicated through material
contact. And mechanical writers
generally consider all dynamical
forces&mdash;that is, all accelerating or
retarding actions&mdash;as functions of
distances; which shows that all
motive actions depend on distance,
not only for their direction, but
also for their intensity. We have
no need of developing these proofs,
as we think that the preceding arguments
are abundantly sufficient
to convince all intelligent readers
of the truth of our conclusion, viz.:
</p>

<p>
1. That distance is a necessary
condition of the action of matter
upon matter;
</p>

<p>
2. That the contact between the
agent and the object acted on is
not material, but virtual, inasmuch
as it is by its active power (<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>virtus</foreign>),
and not by its matter, that the
agent reaches the matter of the object
acted upon;
</p>

<p>
3. Hence that any material substance,
which is anywhere by reason
of its matter, has within itself
a power prepared to act where the
substance itself is not present by its
matter.
</p>

<p>
As the <hi rend='italic'>actio in distans</hi> shocks
vulgar prejudices, and has therefore
many decided adversaries, it is
plain that we must be ready to
meet a great number of objections.
For the present we respectfully invite
those who consider the action
at a distance as an obvious impossibility
to examine carefully the
arguments by which we have established
the impossibility of the
action by material contact. As to
their own reasons for a contrary
opinion, we hope to answer them
satisfactorily as soon as we have
done with the explanation of a few
other preliminaries.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>Power and velocity.</head>

<p>
The question
which now presents itself is
the following: <hi rend='italic'>Is velocity the active
power of material substance?</hi> This
question has some importance in
the present state of science, on account
of the confusion generally
made by physical writers between
powers, forces, actions, and movements.
We answer that, although
active power and velocity are now
generally considered as synonymous,
they are quite different things.
Here are our reasons:
</p>

<p>
In the first place, it is philosophically
<pb n='588'/><anchor id='Pg588'/>
evident that the result of
an action and the principle of the
action cannot be of the same nature.
But velocity is certainly the
result of an action, whilst the active
power is the principle of the action.
And therefore velocity and active
power cannot be of the same nature.
But surely, if velocity has not the
nature of an active power, it is not
an active power, as every one must
admit.
</p>

<p>
In the second place, the active
power of creatures, be they material
or immaterial, is the power by
the exertion of which they manifest
themselves and their natural
perfection, thus leading us to the
knowledge of the existence and the
perfections of our Creator, such a
knowledge being the end of creation.
Active power is therefore
not an accidental and changeable
affection, but an essential, primitive,
and permanent appurtenance of all
created substances; nor does it
come from interaction of creatures,
but only from creation itself; so
that we might well apply to it what
S. Paul says of the power of kings
and rulers: <q>There is no power
except from God.</q> And accordingly
velocity, which is an accidental
and changeable affection of matter,
cannot be the active power of
the material substance.
</p>

<p>
In the third place, if velocity
were the active principle of matter,
matter would have no definite nature
of its own. For <q>nature</q> is
defined as the principle of motion;
and material substance would be
destitute of such a principle; for
velocity, by which it is assumed
that it would cause movement, has
no part in the constitution of the
substance itself. Hence we must
conclude that either material substance
has no definite nature of its
own, or, if this cannot be admitted,
the active power of matter is not its
velocity.
</p>

<p>
In the fourth place, a mass of
matter at rest acts on the body by
which it is supported, and exercises
a pressure against it; and therefore
matter is active independently of
actual movement; which conclusively
shows that the active power
of matter has nothing common with
its velocity.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, velocity is an accidental
mode; and nothing accidental possesses
active power, as has been
shown in one of our philosophical
articles.<note place='foot'><hi rend='smallcaps'>Catholic World</hi>, March, 1874, page 766.</note>
</p>

<p>
Thus it appears that the active
power of material substance is not
its velocity. Those physicists who
acknowledge no other powers but
<q>masses multiplied by velocities</q>
are therefore wholly mistaken. The
product of a mass into its velocity
does not represent an active power,
and not even a dynamical force, but
simply the quantity of an effect
produced by a previous action. It
is true that a mass animated by
velocity can <emph>do work</emph>, which a
mass at rest cannot do. But we
have shown in the article just mentioned
that such a work is done,
not by velocity, but by the natural
powers inherent in the body, the
velocity being only a condition
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>sine qua non</foreign>. Nor does it matter
that the work done by a body is a
function of its velocity. This only
proves that the greater the velocity
of the body, the greater is the resistance
required to exhaust it.
</p>

<p>
Sphere of action.&mdash;The next
question is: <hi rend='italic'>Has matter a sphere of
action? That is, Does a primitive
element of matter act around itself
with equal intensity on all other elements
equally distant from it?</hi>
</p>

<p>
The answer must be affirmative.
</p>

<pb n='589'/><anchor id='Pg589'/>

<p>
And first, since the active principle
of material substance is destined,
as above stated, to produce <emph>local</emph>
movement, it is evident that its
action must proceed from a term
marking a point in space, and reach
other terms marking other similar
points. Local movement, in fact,
cannot be produced, unless the
term acted on be determined by
the agent to follow a certain direction;
for the direction of the movement
must be imparted by the
agent which imparts the movement.
Now, the direction of the movement,
and of the action which
causes it, cannot evidently be conceived
without two distinct points,
the one marked in space by the
agent, the other by the patient.
Hence the exertion of the active
power of matter necessarily proceeds
from a point in space to
other points in space. Whether
such points be rigorously unextended
and mathematically indivisible
we shall inquire in another article;
our object at present is only to show
the necessity of a local term from
which the direction of the action
has to proceed towards other local
terms.
</p>

<p>
This being understood, we can
now show that the point from which
the action of a material element is
directed is the centre of a sphere
of activity, or, in other terms, that
the primitive elements of matter
act in a sphere of which they occupy
the centre. This proposition
implies that material elements not
only act all around, or in every
direction, but also that they act
with equal intensity at equal distances.
This we show in the following
manner.
</p>

<p>
The earth, the planets, and the
sun act in all directions, and the
intensity of their respective actions,
all other things being equal, depends
on their distance from the
bodies acted on; so that, all other
things being equal, to equal distances
equal actions correspond.
That such actions really proceed
from the earth, the planets, and the
sun respectively there can be no
doubt. For to no other sources
can the actions be referred than to
those bodies from which both their
direction and their intensity proceed.
Now, the action by which
a planet is attracted is directed to
the centre of the sun, and the action
by which a satellite is retained
in its orbit is directed to the centre
of the planet to which it belongs.
On the other hand, the intensity of
all such actions varies only with
the distance of the planet from the
sun, and of the satellite from the
planet. Whence we conclude that
the actions which we attribute to
these bodies are really their own.
</p>

<p>
Now, if such great bodies as the
sun, the earth, and all the planets
act thus in a sphere, it is manifest
that every particle of matter in
their mass acts in a sphere. For
the action of the whole mass, being
only a resultant of the particular
actions of all the component elements,
cannot but follow the nature
of its components; and therefore,
from the fact that the action
of the whole mass is directed in a
sphere, and has equal intensity at
equal distances, we must conclude
that all the component actions are
similarly directed, and have equal intensities
at equal distances. Hence
every element of matter has a
sphere of action, and acts all
around itself with equal actions on
all other elements equally distant
from it.
</p>

<p>
This conclusion applies to all
matter. For we have proved, on
the one hand, that matter cannot
act except at a distance, and, on
<pb n='590'/><anchor id='Pg590'/>
the other, we can show by a general
argument that the actions themselves
must be equal at equal distances
around each centre of activity.
It is evident, in fact, that the
actions of any material element on
any other must be equal when the
local relation between the elements
is the same. But whatever be the
position in space of the element
acted on, its local relation to the
other element remains the same
whenever the distance between
them is not altered; for so long as
we consider two elements only, no
other local relation can be conceived
to exist between them than that
of distance; and therefore a change
of position in space which does
not alter the distance of the two
elements leaves them in the same
relation with one another, however
much it may alter their relation to
other surrounding matter. Since,
then, the elements which are arranged
spherically around a given
element are all equally distant
from it, they are all equally related
to it, and are all acted on in the
same manner. And therefore all
material element acts with equal
intensity on all other elements
equally distant from it.
</p>

<p>
The truth of this proposition
being very generally acknowledged
by astronomers and physicists, we
need not dwell on it any longer.
We must, however, mention and
solve two objections which have
been advanced against it. The
first is, that the cohesion of the
molecules in a certain number of
bodies is more energetic in some
directions than in others; as in
crystals, which are cleavable only
in definite planes. This would
tend to show that material elements
do not always act in a sphere.
The second objection is, that the
action of the sun and of the planets,
on which the demonstration of
our proposition is grounded, can
be denied. Some modern physicists,
in fact, hold that what we persist
in calling <q>universal attraction</q>
is not attraction, but only
an ethereal pressure exercised on
the celestial bodies; and if this
be the real case, the action of matter
in a sphere will be out of the
question.
</p>

<p>
In answer to the first objection,
we say that elements of matter and
molecules of bodies are not to be
confounded. The molecule is capable
of internal movements, as
we have already remarked; and
therefore every molecule consists
of a number of primitive elements
having a distinct and independent
existence in space. Hence the action
of a molecule is not a simple
action, but is the resultant of the
actions proceeding from those distinct
elements; and it is plain that,
if such elements are made to approach
the centre of the molecule
in one direction more than in another,
the resultant of their actions
will be greater in one direction
than in another, and the neighboring
molecules will adhere to each
other more firmly in one direction
than in another. This inequality
of molecular actions does not,
however, extend beyond the limits
of molecular distances; for, when
the distance is great (and we can
call <emph>great</emph> those distances in comparison
with which the diameter of
a molecule is of no account), all the
distinct centres of elementary action
may be admitted to coincide
with the centre of the molecule, and
all their spheres to coalesce into one
sphere. And thus at such greater
distances all molecules, no less
than all primitive elements, act in
a sphere.
</p>

<p>
The second objection rests on the
<pb n='591'/><anchor id='Pg591'/>
singular assumption that the universal
ether, owing to the centrifugal
force called into existence by
the rotation of the celestial bodies,
is reduced, around each of them, to
a density directly proportional to
the distance from the centre of the
rotation. Hence they suppose that
the ether which surrounds and
presses the earth must be denser
on the hemisphere where there is
night than on that where there is day,
because the former is more distant
from the sun than the latter; and
they infer that on the former hemisphere
the pressure of the ether must
be greater than on the latter; which
brings them to the conclusion that
the earth must move towards the
sun with a velocity proportional to
the difference between the two pressures.
Such is the theory by which
some modern thinkers tried to
supplant universal attraction. We
need not go far to show the utter
absurdity of this rash conception, as
the most common phenomena and
the most elementary principles of
mechanics supply us with abundant
proofs of its falsity. Centrifugal
force is necessarily perpendicular
to the axis of the rotation, and is
proportional to the radius of the
circle described. Hence its intensity,
which is a <emph>maximum</emph> on the
equator of the revolving body, diminishes
from the equator to the
poles, where it becomes = 0. If,
then, the ether surrounding the
earth (or any other celestial body)
acquires by centrifugal force a
greater density at a greater distance
from the earth, the effect must be
greater at the equator than in any
latitude from the equator to the
poles, and bodies must accordingly
have a greater weight, and fall with
greater impetus, at the equator
than in any latitude. Moreover, all
bodies should fall in the direction
of the pressure&mdash;that is, perpendicularly
to the axis of rotation,
and not perpendicularly to the horizon.
Then, also, the pressure of
the ether being proportional to the
surface of the falling body, of two
equal masses having different surfaces,
the one whose surface is greater
should fall with a greater impetus.
Now, all this is contrary to fact.
</p>

<p>
The preceding remarks suffice to
annihilate the theory. We might
add that centrifugal forces are not
active powers, as the theory assumes,
but only components of the
rotatory movement, and affections
of the rotating matter. Hence, if
the ether surrounding the earth
does not rotate with it, its condensation
through centrifugal force is a
patent impossibility; while, if the
ether rotates with the earth, its
condensation through centrifugal
force will again be impossible, inasmuch
as its centrifugal force will be
greater and greater in proportion
as its distance from the earth is
greater. It is rarefaction, not condensation,
that would take place in
this latter hypothesis. One word
more. If the mere <emph>difference</emph> of
the pressures exercised by the
ether on the two hemispheres of a
planet is sufficient to communicate
to it a considerable centripetal velocity,
as the theory asserts, how
can we escape the conclusion that
all progress of a planet in its orbit
should have been checked long ago
by the <emph>total</emph> pressure of the same
ether on its advancing hemisphere?
</p>

<p>
It is strange indeed that a theory
so preposterous in its assumptions
and so absurd in its consequences
can have found favor with
scientific writers in the full light of
this nineteenth century!

<l>I stood upon a rock what time</l>

<l>The crags were white like frosty rime;</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Her beams upon me fell like rain.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>It was her harvest month of might:</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>The vales and villages were glad;</l>

<lg>
<l>No merchant from the isles of spice</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Who stands in hushed hareem or hall</l>
<l>Who parts his goods, and names the price,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Was I, O friend! I gave thee all.</l>

<p>

</p>

<lg>
<l>High on the hills I sat at dawn</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Where cedar caverns, branching, breathe</l>
<l>Their darkness o'er the dewy lawn,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>While slowly bloomed in heaven a wreath</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Of eastern lilies. Soon the sun</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Ascended o'er the far sea-tide</l>
<l>Smiting to glory billows dun</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>And clouds and trees; and loud I cried,</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>Thou too shalt rise, <emph>my</emph> sun&mdash;thou too&mdash;</q></l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>O'er darkling hearts in power shalt rise,</l>
<l>And flame on souls, and flash on dew</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'><q rend='post'>Of tears that dim expectant eyes.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>And every wind from vale and glen</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Sang loud, <q rend='pre'>He, too, shall rise and shine!</q></l>
<l>A warrior he, a chief of men,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'><q rend='post'>A prince with might; and he is thine.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>

</p>

<lg>
<l>Men praised my words. Thy spirit dwells</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Within me, strangely linked with mine:</l>
<l>At times my mind's remotest cells</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Brighten with thoughts less mine than thine.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>A gleam of thee on me they cast:</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>They wear thy look; they catch thy tone:</l>
<l>A kingdom in my breast thou hast:&mdash;</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>The words they praised were not mine own.</l>
</lg>

<p>
VII.
</p>

<lg>
<l>A chance was that&mdash;our meeting first?</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>At morn I read a quaint old book</l>
<l>That told of maiden palace-nursed</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Who met a prince beside a brook.</l>
</lg>

<pb n='595'/><anchor id='Pg595'/>

<lg>
<l><q>Beside <emph>our</emph> brook the lilies blow,</q></l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>I mused, <q>green-girt, and silver-tipped</q>;</l>
<l>And, dreaming of their bells of snow,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>At eve adown the rocks I tripped.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Sudden I saw thee!&mdash;saw thee take</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Toward me thy path! I turned, and fled:</l>
<l>So swiftly pushed I through the brake</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>My girdle dropped:&mdash;still on I sped.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Had I but guessed that past the dates</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>That hour the stranger youth made way,</l>
<l>I ne'er had left my maiden mates</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Beside that brook, alone, to stray.</l>
</lg>

<p>
VIII.
</p>

<lg>
<l>Surely my thoughts, ere yet we met,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Even then were loyal to their lord;</l>
<l>The tides of all my being set</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Towards thee with blind yet just accord.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>When first I kenned, through showers aslant</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>The snowy Lebanonian line,</l>
<l>When first I heard the night-bird's chant,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Even then my beating heart was thine.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>When minstrels sang the sacred strife,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>And thus I wept, <q rend='pre'>The land made free</q></l>
<l>By warrior's sword is as a wife</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'><q rend='post'>Whose head is on her husband's knee,</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Then, too, I nursed this hope sublime:</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>My breast unconscious turned to thee:</l>
<l>Let no one say there lived a time</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>When thou wert nothing unto me!</l>
</lg>

<p>

</p>

<lg>
<l>How often, dimmed by grateful tears,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>I see that convent near the snow</l>
<l>Wherein I lived those seven sweet years,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>And seven times saw the lilies blow;</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>There sent to couch on pavements cold,</l>

<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Ah! not this love of maid and youth!</l>
<l>To that first love oh! keep me true,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Thou Who art Love at once and Truth!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Have I not heard of hearts that nursed</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>This human love, yet wronged their troth?</l>
<l>That first, great love they outraged first:&mdash;</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Falsehood to that was death to both!</l>

</p>

<lg>
<l>Now glorious grows my Warrior's name:</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>The very babes his praises spread:</l>
<l>But late released, this morn they came</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Around me, clamouring, <q>Give us bread!</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>His light was on them! Freed by him,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>A land redeemed I saw them tread!</l>
<l>I gazed on them with eyes tear-dim:</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>I blessed them, and I gave them bread.</l>

<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Victory, by carnage undisgraced;</l>
<l>To matrons hearts unpierced by war;</l>

<l>To others, these:&mdash;but what to me?</l>

<l>The fawn whose head is on my knee</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>As well as I that gift might tell!</l>

<p>
Livia was the first to return to
herself and put an end to my
singular and ill-timed reverie.
</p>

<p>
<q>I hope, however, you do not
imagine my resolution is to be attributed
to the <foreign rend='italic'>jettatura</foreign>,</q> she said.
</p>

<p>
These words immediately recalled
me to a sense of all that had
taken place the previous hour. I
reflected an instant, and then replied:
</p>

<p>
<q>No; I know too well what you
yourself would think of a vocation
that had such an origin.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And yet I cannot deny,</q> she
said, <q>that it has had a certain influence
on my destiny; for, thanks
to the <foreign rend='italic'>jettatura</foreign>, I have had a heavy,
mysterious cross to bear. It is not
to get rid of this cross I wish to
leave the world, but to embrace it
more closely and experience more
fully the blessings it has revealed
to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is above my comprehension,
Livia. I no longer understand
you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You know very well, however,
do you not, that love is the chief
element of happiness?</q> said she
slowly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, I believe that. Happiness
consists chiefly in loving and
being loved, I imagine. Everything
else is merely accessory.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you know what is accessory
loses all importance when the
whole heart and soul are absorbed
in some adored and adorable being?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; ... but the difficulty is
to love thus though I say this hesitatingly,
lest it seem ungrateful to
Lorenzo.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are right, Ginevra. It is
very difficult, and even impossible,
in this world, as you will some day
realize more fully than you do
now.</q>
</p>

<p>
We were both silent for a few
moments.
</p>

<p>
<q>And my father,</q> I at last resumed&mdash;<q>what
will my poor father
say to this separation?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What would he say, I beg to
know, if a noble, wealthy man&mdash;in
fact, a great lord like Lorenzo&mdash;should
ask my hand on condition
of carrying me away, like you, beyond
the mountains and the sea?
Do you think he would refuse?
Well, neither will he refuse Him
who demands my heart and life.
For, after all, is not he alone
great&mdash;the only Lord?... But
of course my father will decide the
matter. It will be when and as
he wishes.</q>
</p>

<p>
This conversation gave me a
glimpse of a world into which the
hour had not yet come for me to
penetrate, and I was diverted from
the thoughts it awakened in my
soul by the excitement and agitation
that followed. But every
word of this last conversation remained
fixed in my memory; whereas
the incidents and impressions of
the following day only seem like a
dream&mdash;yes, like a dream when I
recall the confusion of that last
day, the preparations both for my
<pb n='598'/><anchor id='Pg598'/>
wedding and my journey (for I
was to leave my father's house and
my native land nearly at the same
time), Ottavia's feverish excitement,
and the quiet activity of Livia,
who thought of everything, and
arranged everything calmly and in
order. Then there was a succession
of calls from our young friends
and relatives, who, according to
the custom in our country, could
not be present at the wedding, and
therefore came to take leave of me
on the eve, and admire at their
leisure the rich presents of the
bridegroom, especially the jewels,
which were unusually splendid.
Among these young girls I particularly
remember my two cousins,
Mariuccia and Teresina, who, as
well as their mother, Donna Clelia,
experienced many conflicting emotions
on the occasion of their young
cousin's brilliant marriage. But interest
and curiosity finally overcame
the grain of ill-humor which
my aunt especially could not help
feeling at seeing me attain a rank
and position which her most ambitious
flights could not hope for her
daughters to obtain. Donna Clelia
was my father's sister, but she did
not resemble him in the least. She
was married to a wealthy man of
an obscure family, and, as she was
remarkable for nothing but her
ability as a manager and her kind
heart, she had passed her life in a
different sphere from that my father
had attained by his talents and
celebrity. This sometimes caused
a temporary feeling of spite, but
she was in the main an excellent
woman and a good mother.
</p>

<p>
At length the great day came
and nearly passed away; for it was
not till night came on&mdash;that is,
about nine o'clock in the evening&mdash;that
the ceremony took place.
The large <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salon</foreign> was illuminated
with all the lights in the crystal
chandelier, and at the farther end
of the room an altar had been
placed, adorned with lights and
flowers. Before it stood good old
Don Placido, awaiting those he was
to unite. His long, white beard
and Capuchin habit formed a singular
contrast to the elegant toilets
around him and the total lack of
any religious aspect&mdash;as was proper
at a wedding in the midst of a brilliant
assembly like this, and in a
place better fitted for worldly gayety
than the celebration of a holy rite.
</p>

<p>
Don Fabrizio soon appeared,
leading the pale, trembling bride
clothed in white, and wearing on
her forehead a coronet of diamonds
whose <foreign rend='italic'>fleurons</foreign> indicated her new
rank. Every eye was fastened on
her, as she knelt beside the bride-groom
at the feet of the venerable
old priest who had baptized her,
and was now waiting to bless her
marriage. I only remember that
the very moment when Don Placido
was joining our hands Livia's
words occurred to my mind: <q>You
are going to pronounce the most
fearful vow there is in the world,</q>
and my voice failed me. Lorenzo,
on the contrary, spoke unhesitatingly
and with perfect distinctness.
Don Placido then addressed us a
few words that affected me to tears,
for he spoke of her who was not
here to accompany her child to the
altar; and this sorrowful recollection,
alluded to in language so
touching, made me forget everything
else, and for a few moments
entirely absorbed me. I cannot
recollect anything more till, leaning
on Lorenzo's arm, I descended
the grand staircase, in order to go
to the palace he owned at a short
distance, and where he had lately
resided. The night was glorious, the
air soft and balmy, and I took a seat
<pb n='599'/><anchor id='Pg599'/>
in the open carriage with nothing
around me but my lace veil. My
bridal dress was becoming, notwithstanding
my paleness, and the diamonds
I was covered with sparkled
in the light of the torches borne
by the attendants. A murmur of
admiration ran through the crowd
at my appearance; and when Lorenzo
took a seat at my side, the
air resounded with cheers and
enthusiastic exclamations. We at
last set off amid cries of <q><foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>Evviva i
sposi!</foreign></q> <q><foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>Evviva il duca!</foreign></q> <q><foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>Evviva
la duchessa!</foreign></q><note place='foot'><q>Long live the spouses! Long live the duke!
Long live the duchess!</q></note> ... We
set off, but not alone. According
to our custom, we were preceded,
accompanied, and followed by a
crowd of relatives and friends who
thronged the house which I now
entered for the first time. I was
obliged to receive them all, listen
to them, reply, and, above all, do
the honors of a place more familiar
to every one there than to myself!
</p>

<p>
This old palace had been very
magnificent once, but it was now
in the dilapidated condition into
which all buildings for a long time
uninhabited generally fall. On
this occasion the walls were covered
with rich hangings, and on
every side there was a profusion
of lights and flowers. It was brilliantly
illuminated without, and
through the open windows of the
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salon</foreign> came the sound of ravishing
music in the garden. For this
evening, at least, they had succeeded
in giving to this ancient habitation
not only a sumptuous and
cheerful aspect, but one really fairy-like.
</p>

<p>
It will not seem surprising that,
agitated and excited as I had been,
the brilliancy of such a <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>soirée</foreign> was
repugnant to my feelings. It may
not even seem astonishing that, in
spite of all that was apparently
combined to intoxicate me with
joy and pride, a scene so brilliant,
so little in accordance with the
solemn emotions of the day, should
have produced an entirely opposite
effect on me. The transition had
been too sudden and abrupt. This
was the first time but once I had
ever been in the gay world, and
the recollections associated with
that occasion were the most terrible
of my life, as well as the most
deeply graven on my memory. It
is not strange, therefore, that I felt
a painful depression of spirits, as
well as a fearful embarrassment
and an irresistible desire to escape
from them all&mdash;even from Lorenzo
himself, whose radiant look seemed
so unable to comprehend my feelings
that I could not turn to him
for the sympathy that had heretofore
inspired me with so much
confidence in him. I looked
around in vain for a glimpse of
my compassionate sister; but she
had been made no exception to
the custom forbidding young girls
to be present at nuptial festivals.
My father, after escorting
me to the door of my new home,
had returned, not being able to
overcome his repugnance to mingle
in the world. Mario that evening
was cold and sarcastic. I felt,
therefore, alone and frightened,
and quite overcome by emotion
and fatigue. In addition to this, I
had a severe headache from the
weight of the coronet I wore, and,
feeling nearly ready to faint, I went
to one of the balconies, when, perceiving
some steps leading to a
vast <foreign rend='italic'>loggia</foreign>, I hastily descended, and
almost ran to seat myself on a
stone bench at the end of the
terrace which overlooked a part of
the garden more retired and obscure
<pb n='600'/><anchor id='Pg600'/>
than the rest. There I felt
I could breathe freely. Away
from the crowd and the dazzling
lights, the sound of the music
faintly heard at a distance, and
looking up with delight through
the foliage at the tranquil heavens
brilliant with stars, I took off the
rich diadem that burdened my
head, and felt relieved as the
evening wind blew back my hair
and cooled my brow. I leaned
my head against my clasped hands,
and did what had hitherto seemed
impossible&mdash;I collected my
thoughts a moment: I reflected
and prayed.
</p>

<p>
I was married. My past life was
at an end. A new and untried
life had begun. What had it in reserve
for me? What lay in the future,
seemingly so brilliant, but in
reality so dark? I could not tell,
and at this moment I felt a vague
terror rather than joyful anticipations.
For the second time that
evening Livia's voice seemed to resound
in my ears, and this time to
echo the words my mother had
written. I seemed to make them
some promise I hardly comprehended
myself, and I murmured the
words: <q>Rather die!...</q>
</p>

<p>
Lorenzo's voice recalled me to
myself. His eyes, which had never
lost sight of me, immediately perceived
my absence, and he was now
at my side. He was alarmed at
first at the sight of my tears, my
disordered hair, and the coronet
lying on the stone bench beside me,
but was reassured when I looked up
with an appealing expression, and
understood me without giving me
the trouble to speak.
</p>

<p>
<q>Poor Ginevra!</q> he softly said
in a caressing tone of protection
which he so well knew how to assume.
<q>Yes, you are right. This
display is foolish, this crowd is
odious, and has been too much for
your strength. And how absurd,</q>
he continued, <q>to hide this golden
hair, and burden so young and fair
a brow with heavy jewels! You did
not need them, my Ginevra. You
were certainly charming with the
coronet on, but much more so as
you are.... Ah! do not shake
your head. You must allow me to
say what I please now. You no
longer have the right to impose silence
on me, and I am no longer
bound to obey you....</q>
</p>

<p>
So saying, he led me slowly back
to the house, but, instead of returning
to the rooms still crowded with
company, he took me another way
leading to a <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>boudoir</foreign> of a circular
form, which was ornamented with
particular care. The gilding, the
mirrors, and the paintings did not
seem to have suffered from the effects
of time like the rest of the
house. Nothing was wanting that
could give this little room a comfortable
and sumptuous aspect.
The soft light of a lamp suspended
from the ceiling was diffused
throughout the room, and perfect
silence reigned.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is your room, Ginevra,</q>
said Lorenzo, carelessly throwing
on one of the tables the circlet of
diamonds he held in his hands.
<q>Here you can quietly repose undisturbed
by the crowd. There is
absolutely nothing to disturb you
here; the music itself can scarcely
be heard. I will leave you, my
Ginevra, to explain your absence
and endure till the end of the evening
the fearful task it pleases them
to impose on us, but from which, at
least, they must allow me to deliver
you.</q>

<p>
The following day, as the breeze
declined, I was standing beside
Lorenzo on the deck of the ship
that was bearing us away. I had
left behind me all I had hitherto
known and loved, and my eyes were
yet tearful from my last farewells.
I stood looking at the receding
shores of Sicily, and the magnificent
amphitheatre of Messina rising up
before us, which presents so imposing
an appearance when seen from
the sea. We soon passed between
the two famous whirlpools which
often afford a comparison for those
among us <foreign rend='italic'>voyageurs</foreign> over the sea of
life who escape one only to fall into
the other&mdash;a comparison figuratively
very apt, though in reality it is
quite doubtful if in our day any
navigator ever falls either into
Scylla or Charybdis.
</p>

<p>
When nothing more was to be
seen, and night came on with its
serene and starry heavens, revealing
only the outline like a silvery
vapor which marked the coast of
Italy, I consented at last to leave
the place where I had been standing
motionless, and took a seat under
an awning Lorenzo had had
put up for me on deck. During
the hour of calm repose I enjoyed
there&mdash;my first and almost only
hour of perfect happiness!&mdash;I was
inspired with renewed hope and
confidence while listening to the
penetrating accents of the husband
whose idol I was, as he depicted
the future in language whose magic
charm seemed to open a whole life
of pleasure before me. After a few
days' rest at Naples, we were to
take a delightful journey through
Italy and France. We should behold
all the places and objects I
had so often seen in imagination,
and whose names were so familiar
to my memory. The interest I was
capable of feeling in every subject,
the curiosity so natural to the
young, and the undeveloped sense
of the beautiful which Lorenzo
knew so well how to draw out and
gratify, the taste for art with which
he was gifted&mdash;all these chords, as
yet nearly untried, seemed to vibrate
within me as I listened to
him. I was like a docile instrument
from which a skilful hand
knows how to draw forth sounds
hitherto unsuspected. As in certain
compositions of the great masters,
the same musical idea is persistently
reproduced in the most varied
modulations, so on all subjects
and on all occasions he found
means to lead my heart back to the
certain conviction of being loved&mdash;loved
as much as in my most ambitious
dreams I had ever imagined
it would be sweet to be loved. At
that moment the vow so <q>fearful</q>
seemed easy to keep; and if Livia's
words had occurred to me then,
they would doubtless have excited
a smile!...
</p>

<p>
One false note, however, or at
least a doubtful one, disturbed for
an instant the harmony that seemed
to reign between us.
</p>

<p>
Every one who has crossed, on a
beautiful summer night, the sea
that washes those enchanted shores,
has doubtless experienced the undefinable
impression of mingled delight
and peace, enthusiasm and
dreaminess, that sometimes comes
over one while watching the stars
becoming more intense in their
brilliancy, and the luminous sea
like a widespread mirror reflecting
the immensity of the heavens. We
grew silent, and after a time I rose
and went to the side of the ship to
contemplate more fully the beauty
<pb n='602'/><anchor id='Pg602'/>
of the night, and there, with uplifted
face and clasped hands, one
of those inarticulate prayers rose
from my heart in which the happiness
of the present moment is confounded
with admiration for the
wonders of the divine creation, and
the soul truly feels itself greater
than the entire universe, because
it alone has the power to render
thanks to Him who not only created
it but the whole world.
</p>

<p>
Lorenzo had followed me, and
taken a seat on the bench that ran
along the side of the ship, where,
with his head leaning on one hand,
and his back to the sea, he sat intently
gazing at me. Filled with
devout thoughts, I took his hand,
and, pressing it in mine, I said:
<q>O my dear husband! let us offer up
one short prayer together&mdash;a prayer
of thanksgiving to God....</q>
His only reply was to seize both of
my hands, and kiss them one after
the other, and then to laugh gently,
as one would at the prattling of a
child!... A sudden sensation
of pain darted through my heart
like an arrow; and if it had not
been so dark, he might have seen
how pale I at once turned. But he
did not notice or suspect my emotion,
though his eyes were fastened
on my face. <q><foreign rend='italic'>Beatrice in suso, ed
io in lei guardava</foreign>,</q><note place='foot'><q>Beatrice upward gazed, and I on her.</q></note> he said in his
most caressing tone. Then he continued:
<q>Your eyes are my heaven,
Ginevra. I need not raise them any
higher.</q>
</p>

<p>
The sentiment to which I had
appealed was one so utterly unknown
to him that he unconsciously
destroyed the emotion I felt.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! Lorenzo,</q> I exclaimed in
my anguish, <q>Dante had a different
meaning, or Beatrice would not
have allowed him to use such language.</q>
Then I stopped, obeying
for the first time the instinctive
feeling, so painful but right, that
checks every word on a woman's
lips which, as has been so well expressed,
would be profaned if not
understood.
</p>

<p>
But this was rather instinctive
than the result of thought with me.
And though the ray of truth that
time was to reveal more fully was
vivid, it was only transient, ...
and my momentary disappointment
left no permanent impression at
the time, though I did not forget
it, and the recollection came back
at a later day.
</p>

<p>
Coming from Sicily, the sight of
the Bay of Naples does not, of
course, inspire the same degree of
wonder and admiration felt by
those who come from the north;
but it was with a feeling of delight
my eyes wandered around, after
passing Capri, and beheld at the
right the wonderful chain of mountains
at whose foot lies the charming
shore of Sorrento; at the left
Posilippo and all the pleasant
villas that crown its height; in
front the marked outline of Vesuvius
standing out against the majestic
Apennines in the distance; and,
finally, Naples, smiling and lovely,
seated on the inner shore of its
beautiful bay! Whatever may be
said as to the possibility of finding
anywhere else in the world a prospect
as magnificent as this, and
even if it is true that there is one, it
would be impossible to remember
it when the view I have just described
is presented to the eye for
the first time.
</p>

<p>
While we were thus rapidly
crossing the bay, and I was gazing
on every side with delight, Lorenzo
pointed out the Villa Reale, beyond
which stood the house we
were to live in, surrounded by a
<pb n='603'/><anchor id='Pg603'/>
large garden&mdash;a charming habitation
which combined all the attractions
of the country and all the advantages
of the city, and which,
when I entered it for the first time,
seemed like a beautiful frame to
the sunny picture of my future
life.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion we only remained
a fortnight at Naples; but this
was sufficient to make me appreciate
my new home, and the prospect
of returning to it an additional
pleasure in the journey before
us. It is, in fact, only pleasant to
travel around the world when we
can see in imagination a place
awaiting us where some day we are
to find rest and deposit the treasures
we have accumulated....
Happily for me, I was then far from
foreseeing those I should have to
bring back when I returned to this
spot!...
</p>

<p>
The day after our arrival Lorenzo
took me for the first time into
his studio, where I was filled with
astonishment at the exquisite perfection
of the productions I found
there. I had often heard him called
a great artist, and I now realized
it was no idle flattery. But I
involuntarily turned my eyes away
from many of them, and stood gazing
with admiration at a statue
which was incontestably the finest
in the gallery. It represented a
young girl whose flowing drapery
was marvellous in execution and
grace. Her face, though perfectly
beautiful, had an expression of
grief and terror. A lamp stood
at her feet, but the light had gone
out.
</p>

<p>
Lorenzo's pride as an artist had
never been gratified with a more
lively or more <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>naïve</foreign> admiration
than mine.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Ginevra <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>mia</foreign>!</q> he exclaimed,
<q>if I have hitherto been considered
an artist, what shall I be
when I have you for my model and
my judge?</q>
</p>

<p>
He then told me that this beautiful
statue represented a vestal, but
it lacked a pendant which he had
never been able to execute.
</p>

<p>
<q>But now,</q> he added, <q>I am
sure of succeeding. I have long
sought a model for my second
vestal, and at last I have found
one.</q>
</p>

<p>
He put my hair back with one
hand, and, examining me attentively
with a thoughtful air, continued,
as if talking to himself: <q>Yes, ...
these faultless features, the noble,
dignified air of the head, the profound
expression of the eyes, and
the gravity of the mouth, constitute
the very type I want. I could
not find a better combination of
all I need for my noble, mysterious
vestal&mdash;the vigilant, faithful guardian
of the sacred fire. I will begin
it to-morrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not here, will you?</q> said I,
glancing uneasily at a Bacchante
as unlike as possible to the statue
I had been admiring, and which I
could hardly believe came from
the same hand. Lorenzo looked
at me with astonishment, and hardly
seemed to comprehend me.
He only regarded such things from
an artistic point of view&mdash;perhaps a
valid excuse, but it was the second
time within two days his uncommon
penetration had been at fault.
He was really skilful at reading a
passing thought that had not been
expressed, and in penetrating somewhat
below the surface, but he was
incapable of looking deeply into a
soul, or of following it when it rose
to certain heights. When I clearly
made known my wishes, however,
he immediately assented to them,
and took me into an adjoining room
that was smaller.
</p>

<pb n='604'/><anchor id='Pg604'/>

<p>
<q>Just as you please,</q> he said.
<q>You shall come here to sit to me,
and I promise you, Ginevra, that
there shall be nothing in this studio
except what you are willing to
look at.</q>
</p>

<p>
During my first stay at Naples we
made no visits, and our doors were
closed against every one. It was our
honeymoon. Lorenzo chose to pass
it entirely alone with me, and I was
far from wishing it otherwise. Every
one respected our solitude. Nevertheless,
as soon as my arrival was
known, Lorenzo's friends and acquaintances,
with the proverbial
courtesy of Neapolitan society, sent
me their cards as a sign of welcome.
We looked them over together in
the evening, and I thus learned
the names of the acquaintances I
should soon have to make. Lorenzo
sometimes laughingly made comments
on them which were more
or less flattering and diffuse. One
evening, however, he excited a feeling
of surprise and uneasiness. I
had, as usual, taken up the cards
that had been left that day, when I
saw him change color at the sight
of one, which he snatched hastily
from my hand, and tore into a thousand
pieces. The extreme suddenness
of the act checked the question
I was on the point of asking. I remained
silent, but the name I had
read on the card was graven ineffaceably
on my memory in consequence
of the occurrence. I shall
never forget it. Lorenzo quickly
recovered himself at seeing my surprise,
and told me it was the card
of a foreign lady who had left Naples,
and whose call I never need
trouble myself to return. Then
taking up the next card, he read
aloud:
</p>

<p>
<q>Stella d'Oria, Contessa di San
Giulio.</q> <q>Ah! as for her,</q> he
exclaimed, <q>you will like her, I
know, and I am willing you should
become friends. I used to consider
her a little too perfect to suit
me, but I am of a different opinion
when it is a question of my
wife....</q>
</p>

<p>
The new statue was begun without
any delay. I sat to him two or
three hours every day, and in the
evening we took long walks on the
heights of Camaldoli, where we were
most sure of not meeting any one. He
enjoyed my admiration for the wonderful
aspect of nature around us,
and took pleasure in giving me a
fresh surprise every day. And he
was not yet tired of entertaining
me with the varied events of his
past life, and of witnessing the interest
his conversation invariably
excited in one who possessed an intelligent
but unstored mind. Complete
harmony seemed to reign between
us, and yet more than once
during the brief duration of these
happy days it was suddenly disturbed
by some discordant note which
caused the vague uneasiness I have
already spoken of that seemed like
one of those momentary shooting
pains that are the premonitions of
some fixed, incurable disease. In
both cases they are experienced a
long time before the cause is understood,
and the disease is often far
advanced before the tendency of
these symptoms is clear and unmistakable.
</p>

<p>
The terrible chastisement that
followed the gratification of my
vanity on that one occasion had inspired
me, as I have said, with a
kind of repugnance, if not terror, to
have my face praised. This repugnance
<pb n='605'/><anchor id='Pg605'/>
on the part of a young girl
who had reason to be proud of her
beauty was an originality which
had perhaps given me additional
attraction in Lorenzo's eyes. Now
I was his wife, I could not, of course,
expect him to obey me and keep up
the same reserve in our intercourse.
And yet how many times, especially
during those long sittings in the
studio, I longed to impose silence
on him!... How many times I
felt a blush mount to my forehead
when, after arranging my drapery
and attitude, unbraiding and putting
my long hair to suit his own fancy,
and making me change my position
a dozen times, he would fall into an
ecstasy against which my whole
soul revolted! Was this the passion
full of mingled tenderness and respect
that I should have been as
proud to inspire as to experience?
Was this really being loved as I had
longed to be? I sometimes asked
myself if his admiration for the
hands, arms, face, and whole form
of a statue was of a different nature.
I did not yet go so far as to wonder
if some other woman, merely
endowed with greater beauty than
I, could not easily rob me of a love
that had so frail a foundation....
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, we left Naples when
the fortnight was at an end, though
the statue was not half finished.
Our long <foreign rend='italic'>tête-à-tête</foreign> had not proved
to be all I had anticipated. I hoped
more from the journey, and this
hope was not disappointed. Lorenzo
was capable of being the best and
most intelligent of guides everywhere,
and such he was during our
rapid journey through Italy, where
we only remained long enough in
each city to admire the monuments
and museums, though we
did not follow the beaten track of
ordinary tourists. Lorenzo thought
himself versed in everything relating
to art and history, and yet he did
not seem to realize that the church
had also had its <foreign rend='italic'>rôle</foreign> in the history
of his country. Therefore one side
of Italian history escaped him entirely,
and I do not know if, even at
Rome, it had ever occurred to him
there had been any change whatever
of religion between the building
of the Temple of Vesta and the
time when the dome of Michael
Angelo was raised in the air. Both
are worthy of admiration in a different
degree, and he regarded them
with the same eye. But I did not
then perceive all he left unexpressed.
My thoughts and attention
were absorbed by all there was
around me to see. I was astonished
to find myself in a world so fruitful
in sources of interest that perhaps
there is no one man on earth able
to investigate them all equally.
One alone, independent of the rest,
might really suffice for the study of
a whole life-time.
</p>

<p>
At length we arrived at Paris.
Lorenzo, of course, had frequently
made long visits there, and had a
host of friends and acquaintances
there as well as everywhere else.
A few days after our arrival, I attended
a large ball for the first
time since my marriage, and the
second in my life. I heard my
name murmured on every side. I
was surrounded with homage and
overwhelmed with compliments. I
was afterwards informed I had been
the object of universal admiration;
that nothing was talked of but the
beauty of the Duchessa di Valenzano
and her diamonds; and that
a journal accustomed to give an
account of the gayeties of the season
had devoted a long paragraph to
the description of my dress and
person.
</p>

<p>
All this was reported to us by a
young cousin of Lorenzo's whose
<pb n='606'/><anchor id='Pg606'/>
name, in reality, was Landolfo Landini,
though his friends usually
called him Lando Landi. He had
lived in Paris several years, and
considered himself almost a Frenchman.
He had acquired the stamp
of those people who have no aim in
life&mdash;as easily imitated as they are
unworthy of being so&mdash;and had
wasted the natural cleverness and
good-nature which redeemed some
of his faults. He prided himself
particularly on using the language
of polite society, and was under the
illusion that he completely disguised
his nationality. When he fell in
with a fellow-countryman, however,
he allowed his natural disposition
to reassert itself, and indulged in a
flow of language that might have
been amusing to some, but to me
was frivolous and tiresome, and,
after listening to the account of my
grand success the previous evening
with a coolness that seemed to astonish
him, I fell into a reverie that
had more than one cause. Why
had Lorenzo watched me so attentively
all the evening before? It
was the first time we had appeared
in society together, and he was
anxious I should create a sensation.
He himself had carefully selected
the dress I was to wear, and I was
pleased with the admiration with
which he regarded me. On this
point I had no hesitation: I was
anxious to please <emph>him</emph>, but not to
<emph>please</emph>; and as to the gay world into
which he now introduced me, I
entered it with the pleasure and
curiosity of a child, and the lively
interest inspired by everything that
is new; but I had become strangely
insensible to the pleasure of being
admired, or even the gratification
that springs from vanity.
</p>

<p>
In alluding once more to this
fact, I will add that it was the effect
of an exceptional grace; for at no
remote period of my youth had my
mother detected the germ of this
poisonous plant which was to shed
so baleful an influence over the
simplicity and uprightness of my
nature.
</p>

<p>
This plant had been swept away
in a single tempestuous night, and
a divine hand had plucked out almost
its last root. Was this peculiar
grace (the forerunner of a much
greater one I was to receive at a
later day) granted me in answer to
the prayer of my dying mother?
Or was it to the sincere repentance
that had so overwhelmed my soul?
These things are among the mysteries
of divine mercy beyond one's
power to fathom. But it is certain
I was thus preserved from one of
the greatest dangers that await
most ladies in the fashionable
world. I was very far from being
invulnerable on all points, as the
future showed only too plainly; but
I was on this.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, I had not been put
to so decided a proof before.
Never had I seen or imagined so
brilliant a scene. I was delighted
and charmed, and unhesitatingly
gave myself up to the enjoyment
of the evening; but the incense
lavished on me added nothing to
my pleasure. It only produced a
certain timidity that lessened my
ease and greatly diminished my
enjoyment. I sincerely think if I
had been less beautiful or more
simply dressed&mdash;in a word, less admired&mdash;I
should have been happier
and much more at my ease.
</p>

<p>
In my embarrassment I was
glad to find Lorenzo always near
me, and the more so because I had
no idea it was not absolutely the
custom. But I noticed with some
surprise that he observed every
movement I made with a strange
attention, and listened to every
<pb n='607'/><anchor id='Pg607'/>
word I uttered when addressed.
Perhaps others did not perceive
this, but I understood his quick, observant
glance and the expressive
features he knew so well how to
control, and I knew also the art
with which he could seem occupied
with what was going on at one end
of a room, while his whole attention
was absorbed in what was said at the
other. In short, I felt he had not
lost sight of me a single instant the
whole evening, and that not one
of my words had escaped him. I
wondered if his affection for me
was the sole cause of this constantly-marked
solicitude. This was
the primary cause of my uneasiness.
Another arose from the conversation
that was actually going
on in my presence, which I listened
to with pain, and as a passive
witness; for I could take no
part in it.
</p>

<p>
How could Lorenzo take any
pleasure in the trivial details, the
unmeaning gossip, and the doubtful
jests of Landolfo Landini?...
How could he question him, reply
to what he said, and encourage him
to continue? And yet Lorenzo
was a very different person from
his cousin. He was very far from
leading an aimless life. He had
undertaken long, dangerous journeys
that had entailed great exertion
and incredible fatigue, in order to
increase his extensive and varied
knowledge. He was capable of
continued application. Talents like
his could only be acquired by profound
study of a hundred different
subjects, as well as by long, serious,
persevering practice in the art
in which he had become such a
proficient. One can hardly conceive
of frivolity in an artist, and
yet this anomaly exists. I have
since remarked it in others, as I
observed it now in Lorenzo&mdash;a
proof, doubtless, that to soar above
the every-day world, and keep at
such heights, talent and genius, no
more than the soul, should be separated
from God!
</p>

<p>
The morning at length passed
away, and about four o'clock we
ordered the <foreign rend='italic'>calèche</foreign> for a long
drive. The first hour was devoted
to making numerous purchases.
Lando Landi escorted us. Perfect
familiarity with the shops of Paris
was one of his specialties. Above
all, he knew where to find those
curiosities that are almost objects
of art, and which have the gift, so
precious to those who sell them, of
inducing people who make the first
purchase to continue indefinitely;
for each new object of that class
acquires additional value in the
eyes of a connoisseur, and in such
matters, more than any other, <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>l'appétit
vient en mangeant</foreign>.<note place='foot'>The appetite comes with eating.</note>
</p>

<p>
We remained more than an hour
in the first shop we stopped at.
Lorenzo was in his element. He
was a genuine connoisseur in everything.
He examined bronzes, porcelains,
furniture of every epoch,
carved wood from all countries, and
old tapestry, with a sure and experienced
eye, and the merchant, seeing
whom he had to deal with,
brought out of his secret recesses
treasures hidden from the vulgar,
and multiplied temptations Lorenzo
seemed very little inclined to
resist. As for me, I took a seat
beside the counter, and looked with
indifference at the various objects
that were spread out before me,
but of which I was quite unable to
perceive the value, which was somewhat
conventional. I was a little
astonished at the number and value
of Lorenzo's purchases, but, on the
whole, the business did not interest
<pb n='608'/><anchor id='Pg608'/>
me much, and I felt glad when it
was at an end.
</p>

<p>
<q>Bravo! Lorenzo,</q> said Lando
as soon as we re-entered the carriage.
<q>You don't do things half
way. That is the way I like to see
other people spend their money.
It consoles me for not having any
myself to throw out of the window.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have got to entirely refurnish
my palace in Sicily,</q> said Lorenzo,
<q>as well as to decorate my house in
Naples, which is quite unworthy of
her who is to live in it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are jesting, Lorenzo,</q> said
I. <q>You know very well I think
nothing is lacking.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is the consequence of
your extreme youth, my dear cousin,</q>
said Lando. <q>Wait a while,
and you will find out how much
becomes indispensable to one who
has lived in Paris.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At all events,</q> said Lorenzo,
<q>now or never is the time for me
to gratify my fancy. I am just
going to housekeeping. I have
barely spent a third of my present
fortune, and am perfectly confident
as to that I shall have; for everybody
knows that a cause undertaken
by Fabrizio dei Monti is a
cause gained.</q>
</p>

<p>
At that instant a beautiful lady
in a conspicuous dress passed us in
an elegant <foreign rend='italic'>calèche</foreign>, and the conversation
suddenly took a different
turn. Lorenzo silently questioned
his cousin with a look, and Lando
began to give him in a low tone
some information which an instinctive
repugnance prevented me from
listening to....
</p>

<p>
I began (perhaps unjustly) to
conceive a strong dislike to this
Cousin Landolfo, and I imagine he
would have been very much astonished
had he guessed with what eye
I now looked at his face, generally
considered so handsome. It was
of a type often admired out of Italy,
because somewhat different from
that foreigners are accustomed to,
who have no idea to what a degree
it is common in that country. A
dark complexion, rather handsome
eyes, fine teeth, and curly black
hair, formed in my eyes a most unpleasing
combination, and, without
knowing a word they were saying,
I felt positively certain he had
never in his life uttered a syllable I
should think worth listening to.
</p>

<p>
At length we left the boulevards,
drove through the Champs Elysées,
and at last found ourselves in the
shade of the Bois de Boulogne.
While my two companions were
conversing together in a low tone,
I abandoned myself to the pleasure
of being in a cool place where I
could breathe more freely; for, unaccustomed
to going out during the
middle of the day in summer, the
heat had seemed overpowering.
Apart from this, there was nothing
here to strike a person accustomed
to the loveliest scenery in the
world. Unused as I was to Parisian
life, the charm of which often
produces an impression that effaces
all others, the things I saw had
no other prestige in my eyes than
what they were in themselves.
Viewed in this light, the museums,
churches, and palaces seemed less
grand and magnificent than those
we had seen before, and the promenades
less picturesque and less varied.
I missed particularly the
lovely vistas which everywhere in
Italy form the background of the
picture, and attract the eye, and
elevate the mind to something
higher than the mere treasures of
history and art that have accumulated
in all old Italian cities.
</p>

<p>
And yet it cannot be denied that
Paris has the power of making itself
<pb n='609'/><anchor id='Pg609'/>
preferred to any other place in
the world. It speaks a different
language to every individual, and
is comprehended by all. It is
filled with treasures of every kind,
and has wherewithal to gratify
every taste indiscriminately, from
that which is evil in its vilest form
to an excess of goodness amounting
to sublimity; from the most refined
extravagance of fashion to
the extreme renunciation of charity;
and from pleasure in its most
dangerous aspect to piety in its
most perfect manifestations. It
flatters vanity and vice more than
would be dared anywhere else, and
yet it prides itself on being able
to produce examples of goodness,
devotedness, and humility that are
almost unparalleled. In a word,
every one, for a different reason,
feels more at home there than anywhere
else in the world. He who
once learns to love Paris finds it
difficult to like any other city as
well; and he who has lived there
finds it hard to resign himself to
live in any other place. It is the
one city on earth that has been able
to vie with Rome in the honor of
being the home of all nations....

<p>
The Validity Of The Edwardine
Rite.
</p>

<p>
Before entering upon the theology
of the question, we must meet an initial
objection of Anglicans to our attempting
to criticise the Edwardine
rite. They insist that the question
has been settled long ago, and in
their favor, by no less an authority
than the Holy See and its legate,
Cardinal Pole. The cardinal, they
say, in accordance with instructions
from Rome, admitted all the schismatical
bishops and clergy, who were
not irreconcilables, in the orders they
had received in schism, whether according
to the Pontifical or according
to the Edwardine rite. Great
stress has been laid upon this by Anglican
controversialists from Bramhall
down to Mr. Haddan; and certainly,
if it be a true statement of the
case, the value of the objection can
scarcely be overrated. Its truth must
be decided by an appeal to the Papal
briefs and to the official acts of the
legate.
</p>

<p>
The bull of March 8, 1553-4, granting
full legatine faculties to Pole, authorizes
him to deal with two classes
of the bishops and clergy&mdash;viz., of the
clergy, those who have not received
orders at all, and those who have
received them ill; that is to say, orders
null and orders irregular (ordines quos
nunquam, aut male susceperunt). The
bishops, in like manner, who have
received cathedral churches from
Henry or Edward are divided into
those on whom <q>the gift of consecration
has been heretofore conferred,</q>
and <q>those on whom it is not
yet conferred</q> (munere consecrationis
eis hactenus impenso vel si
illud eis nondum impensum exstiterit).
The cases in which the ordination
or consecration had been validly
though irregularly conferred are also
described as <q>received from heretical
or schismatical bishops, or in other
respects unduly</q> (quod iis ab episcopis
hæreticis et schismaticis aut
alias minus rite et non servatâ formâ
ecclesiæ consuetâ impensum fuit).
By these last words power is given
<q>to consider cases in which the ancient
form of the sacrament had not
been observed, and, if the form used
was sufficient for validity, to admit it
as such, and to admit a person ordained
in such a manner to exercise
the orders so received.</q>
</p>

<p>
Canon Estcourt shows that the
<q>minus rite</q> cannot be intended to
<emph>designate</emph>, as Mr. Haddan and others
have maintained, the Edwardine orders.
He appeals to the dispensations
granted to no less than eight
bishops, all ordained according to
the Pontifical in Henry VIII.'s time,
wherein their orders are referred to
as received <q>ab episcopis hæreticis
et schismaticis aut alias <emph>minus rite</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
In the faculties granted by Pole to
his bishops for the absolution and
rehabilitation of priests, he carefully
explains their limitation to cases in
which <q>the form and intention of the
church have been preserved.</q> Thus
it is clear <q>that though the cardinal
had power to recognize ordinations
in which some departure had been
made from the accustomed form, yet
that, on examination, he found no
other form in use which could be admitted
by the church as valid.</q> In
the same faculties he permits the ordination,
if they are otherwise fit, of
<pb n='611'/><anchor id='Pg611'/>
those whose orders are <q>null.</q> He
describes them as persons holding
benefices without being ordained.
</p>

<p>
In 1554, Bonner, Bishop of Bath
and Wells, gave a commission to his
vicar-general <q>to deal with married
laics who, in pretence and under
color of priestly orders, had rashly
and unlawfully mingled themselves
in ecclesiastical rights, and had obtained
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>de facto</foreign> parochial churches
with cure of souls and ecclesiastical
dignities, against the sacred sanctions
of the canons and ecclesiastical rights,
and to deprive and remove them
from the said churches and dignities.</q>
It is impossible to conjecture who
else these unordained beneficiaries
can be, if they are not the Edwardine
clergy.
</p>

<p>
Anglicans, on the other hand, have
made a great deal of a certain testimonial
letter granted by Bonner to
Scory, which speaks of the latter's sin
and repentance, and of his subsequent
rehabilitation by Bonner, and
restoration to the public exercise of
the ecclesiastical ministry within the
diocese of London. As Scory is
spoken of as <q>our confrère, lately
Bishop of Chichester,</q> it is urged that
the ministry to the exercise of which
he was restored must have been that
of a bishop. Canon Estcourt, after
pointing out certain grounds for suspecting
the authenticity of this letter,
remarks that Bonner's faculties only
extended to the case of priests, <q>so
that Scory must have acknowledged
the nullity of his consecration, in
order to enable Bonner to deal with
him at all</q>; and, after all, <q>the letter
does no more than enable him to
celebrate Mass in churches within
the diocese of London</q>&mdash;in fact, to
exercise that office, and that office
only, which he had received <q>servatâ
formâ et intentione ecclesiæ.</q> So
much for the Holy See's approval of
the Edwardine orders.
</p>

<p>
Anglicans have tried to make out
a charge of inconsistency against the
Holy See, on the ground that it did
not recognize the episcopate of Ridley,
Latimer, and Ferrer&mdash;who were
all three supposed to have been consecrated
according to the Roman
Pontifical&mdash;but degraded them from
the priesthood and inferior orders
only. Canon Estcourt admits that
Ferrer was treated merely as a priest,
but he shows that his consecration
had been a medley rite, in which the
order of the Pontifical was not followed.
As to Latimer, he remarks
that there is no pretence for saying
that he was not degraded from the
episcopate; and that, with regard to
Ridley, the great weight of authority
makes for his having been degraded
from the episcopate. Cardinal
Pole, in his commission, ordered that
both Ridley and Latimer should be
degraded <q>from their promotion and
dignity of bishops, priests, and all other
ecclesiastical orders.</q> The Bishop
of Lincoln, in his exhortation to Ridley,
says: <q>You were made a bishop according
to our laws.</q> Heylin says
that they were both degraded from
the episcopate. The only authority
for the contrary opinion is Foxe,
who makes the acting commissioner
Brookes, Bishop of Gloucester, conclude
an address to Ridley thus:
<q>We take you for no bishop, and
therefore we will the sooner have
done with you.</q> Foxe then proceeds
to describe the actual ceremony as
a degradation from the priesthood.
Canon Estcourt's reviewer in the
<hi rend='italic'>Dublin Review</hi> of July, 1873, maintains
that Foxe was right. The reviewer
thinks that Ridley and Latimer
were not degraded from the
episcopate, because the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>status episcopalis</foreign>
was not recognized in those
who, though <emph>validly</emph> consecrated, had
not received the Papal confirmation.
Upon this we remark, 1st, that the
<pb n='612'/><anchor id='Pg612'/>
ceremonies of degradation came into
use when it was a very common opinion
in the church that degradation
destroyed the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>potestas ordinis</foreign>. 2. That
the form of degradation, in so many
words, expresses the taking away the
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>potestas ordinis</foreign>&mdash;<q>amovemus a te,</q>
<q>tollemus tibi,</q> <q>potestatem offerendi,</q>
<q>potestatem consecrandi</q>&mdash;and
this in contradistinction to another
form of perpetual suspension&mdash;<q>ab executione
potestatis.</q> The ceremony
aims at effecting the destruction of
orders, so far as this is possible. It
may be called a <q>destruction of orders,</q>
in the same sense that mortal
sin is called the crucifixion of Christ
anew. Indeed, in one place, the
clause, <q>quantum in nobis est,</q> is introduced.
3. Degradation does not
depend upon previous confirmation;
for Innocent II. (1139) thus deals
with those who had been consecrated
bishops by the antipope Peter Leo,
who therefore assuredly had never
been confirmed or acknowledged in
any way by the pope. After exclaiming,
<q>Quoscunque exaltaverat
degradamus,</q> etc., etc., <q>he violently
wrested their pastoral staffs from
their hands, and ignominiously tore
from their shoulders the pontifical
palls in which their high dignity resides.
Their rings, too, which express
their espousals with the church,
showing them no mercy, he drew
off.</q><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Ex Chron. Mauriniac. ap. Harduin Concil.</hi>,
tom. 6, p. 1214.</note> If the Bishop of Gloucester
really acted as Foxe describes, he
did so on his own responsibility, and
in the teeth of ecclesiastical precedent.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most important and
interesting portion of Canon Estcourt's
book is that in which he discusses
the theological value of the
Edwardine form. It is not merely
of controversial importance, but is
really calculated to throw light upon
the theology of orders, which, as a
Catholic contemporary well observes,
is still in course of formation.
</p>

<p>
Canon Estcourt, following Benedict
XIV., <hi rend='italic'>De Syn. Dioc.</hi>, lib. viii. cap.
10, maintains, as the more probable
opinion, 1, that, in the case of the
priesthood, the second imposition of
hands, with the prayer for the infusion
<q>of the virtue of the sacerdotal
grace,</q> is all that is really necessary
for validity; although, in practice, we
of the West must ordain again <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>sub
conditione</foreign>, if the tradition of the instruments
has been omitted. 2. That
in the case of priests, the third imposition
of hands, with the words, <q>Receive
the Holy Ghost; whose sins
thou dost remit, they are remitted unto
them; and whose sins thou retainest,
they are retained,</q> is not essential,
and, if omitted, is to be supplied
without repeating the rest. 3. That
as to the episcopate, the <q>Accipe
Spiritum Sanctum,</q> with the imposition
of hands, is all that is essential;
and, finally, he allows, in deference to
the Holy Office (<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>vide infra</foreign>), that the
form&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the prayer immediately accompanying
the imposition of hands&mdash;need
not express the specific character
or work of the order conferred,
as, for instance, the Holy Sacrifice in
the ordination of a priest.
</p>

<p>
Consistently with these principles,
Canon Estcourt admits that, <emph>so far as
words go</emph>, <q>Receive the Holy Ghost</q>
is a sufficient form both for the episcopate
and the priesthood. As regards
the episcopate, this has been
long a common opinion. As regards
the priesthood, the Sacred Congregation
of the Inquisition, in 1704, decided
that certain Abyssinians had
been validly ordained priests by imposition
of hands and the words,
<q>Accipe Spiritum Sanctum.</q> From
this it follows that the Anglican forms
for ordaining priests and bishops are,
<emph>so far as words go</emph>, sufficient. They
<pb n='613'/><anchor id='Pg613'/>
are as follows, from 1549 to 1662,
for the priesthood: <q>Receive the
Holy Ghost; whose sins thou dost
forgive, they are forgiven; and whose
sins thou dost retain, they are retained;
and be thou a faithful dispenser
of the word of God and of his
holy sacraments, in the name of the
Father, etc.</q> For the episcopate:
<q>Take the Holy Ghost, and remember
that thou stir up the grace of
God which is in thee by imposition
of hands; for God hath not given us
the spirit of fear, but of power and
love and soberness.</q> In 1662, certain
changes were introduced by the
High Church party. In the form
for the priesthood, after the words
<q>Holy Ghost</q> was added, <q>for the
office and work of a priest in the
church of God, now committed unto
thee by the imposition of our hands.</q>
For the form of the episcopate was
substituted, <q>Receive the Holy
Ghost for the office and work of a
bishop in the church of God, now
committed unto thee by the imposition
of our hands, in the name of the
Father, etc.</q>
</p>

<p>
Of course the value of Anglican
orders <q>secundum formam</q> must
depend upon the value of the form
as it originally stood. The subsequent
alterations are important as
marking, 1st, the dissatisfaction of
the High Church party with the
forms upon which their orders depended;
2d, the low theological
standard which satisfied them, after
all.
</p>

<p>
So far as the material words of the
Edwardine forms go, they are sufficient&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>,
they are words capable of
being used in a sense in which they
would be sufficient&mdash;but the words
are ambiguous. The form of ordination,
although it need not express,
must signify or mean, the essential
idea of the order. Where it does not
carry its meaning on the face of it,
we must look for it in the rite and
liturgy of which it forms a part. This
is not an appeal to the mere subjective
intention of the minister, but to
the objective meaning of the words.
Upon this principle we must, in order
to get at the value of the Anglican
forms, discover, 1st, by an examination
of the various admittedly
valid rites of ordination, what such
words should mean; 2d, by an examination
of the Anglican rite, what
these words, in the position which
they occupy in that rite, do or do
not mean.
</p>

<p>
Canon Estcourt examines the numerous
rites which the Roman Church
acknowledges to be valid, whether
fallen out of use, and only to be
found in the pages of ancient sacramentaries,
or still living and operative,
in East or West, among Catholics
or among those who have separated
from Catholic unity. He finds
three qualities in which they all unite:
1st, a recognition of the divine vocation
or election of the ordained; 2d,
a recognition of the <q>virtus sacramentalis</q>
of orders, as something
quite distinct from and beyond the
grace which is also given to the ordained
to acquit himself worthily in
the duties of his calling; 3d, a constant
recognition of, and appeal to,
the main scope and duty of orders&mdash;the
offering of the Holy Sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
Canon Estcourt next proceeds to
examine the Anglican liturgy and
ordinal with special reference to
these three points: 1. The divine
election. 2. The sacramental virtue.
3. The Holy Sacrifice. And he finds
that both the liturgy and the ordinal
are the result of a deliberate manipulation
of the ancient Catholic ritual
previously in use, in order to the exclusion
of these three points, which contain
the essential idea of holy orders.
</p>

<p>
Ordination in the Anglical ritual
no longer appeals to a divine election,
<pb n='614'/><anchor id='Pg614'/>
of which it is the expression
and the fulfilment. It is merely the
public expression of the approval of
the authorities of church and state.
For the <q>virtus sacramentalis</q> it
has substituted a mere <foreign rend='italic'>grâce d'état</foreign>.
From this it only naturally follows
that episcopal ordination cannot be
of indispensable necessity, or more
than a matter of regulation and propriety
which, in an emergency, may
be abrogated. This is the express
teaching of many of the early Anglican
reformers. Even when engaged
in defending their episcopal succession,
they are careful to say that they
do not regard it as indispensable.
Hooker, who is in many respects so
much more orthodox than his predecessors
and contemporaries, allows
<q>that there may be sometimes very
just and sufficient reason to allow
ordination to be made without a
bishop.</q>
</p>

<p>
Canon Estcourt prints considerable
portions of the Anglican ordinal
and liturgy in parallel columns, with
the corresponding text of the Sarum
and Exeter pontificals and missals.
We see with what an unerring sacrilegious
instinct everything bearing
upon the Holy Sacrifice, and even
upon the Real Presence, is either cut
out or perverted.
</p>

<p>
As regards the Second Book of
1552, it is clear that it was the work
of sacramentarians who disbelieved
in the Real Presence in any sense,
and was undertaken for the express
purpose of purging the ritual of what
previous handling had still allowed it
to retain of the impress of that Presence.
Mr. Cardwell, in his comparison
of the <q>Two Books of Edward
VI.,</q> pref. xxvii., admits that Cox
and Taylor, who were probably the
working members of the commission,
appear to have looked upon the oblation
of the Eucharist as consisting
merely of <q>prayer, thanksgiving, and
the remembrance of our Saviour's
passion.</q> Of Cranmer, the most influential
member of the commission,
we are told that <q>about a year after
the publication of King Edward's
First Book, Archbishop Cranmer
abandoned his belief in the Real
Presence&mdash;a change which seems to
have been very acceptable to the
young king and his favorites.</q><note place='foot'>Wilberforce, <hi rend='italic'>Holy Euchar.</hi>, p. 438.</note> In
the revision of 1662, an apparent attempt
was made to attain to the expression
of a higher doctrine, both as
regards orders and the Holy Eucharist;
but even if the expressions introduced
were in themselves adequate,
as Canon Estcourt fairly shows they
were not, of what avail could have
been so tardy a restoration? But if
we examine these restorations and
emendations, we can hardly avoid
coming to the conclusion that they
were not really dictated by any conception
of, or aspiration after, a higher
doctrine, but were the genuine
fruits of a conservative reaction fired
by controversial pique. The First
Book substituted for the Catholic
faith a hazy Lutheranism; the Second
Book for this again a hazy sacramentarianism;
and the revision of 1662,
a hazy compound of the two, with
the addition of a Catholic phrase or
so in order to support claims to a
wider sweep of church authority.
Thus the revisers of 1662 introduced
the words <q>priest</q> and <q>bishop</q>
into the ordination form, whilst doing
absolutely nothing toward restoring
the idea of sacrifice to the liturgy.
</p>

<p>
But, it may be urged, there is one
portion of the Anglican form for
making priests which expresses the
Catholic doctrine of priestly virtue&mdash;the
power of forgiving sins. Unfortunately
for Anglicans, whatever force
may lie in this expression&mdash;and all
precedents are against its being regarded
<pb n='615'/><anchor id='Pg615'/>
as a sufficient form&mdash;is neutralized
by the Lutheran new form of
absolution which had been introduced
in addition to the two Catholic forms.
At best, one is left in doubt whether
the mighty words have not shrivelled
into a Lutheran sense, in which sins
are not forgiven, but the forgiveness
of sin is merely declared.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to do justice in a
review to the exhaustive completeness
of Canon Estcourt's treatment
of this portion of his subject. His
conspectus of the Catholic missals
and the different editions of the <hi rend='italic'>Book
of Common Prayer</hi> in parallel columns
enables us, as it were, to detect
the pulsations of each several heresy,
and to appreciate its share in what
may be called the passion of the
Catholic liturgy in England. A
quotation from each of his parallels
may serve as examples of, 1st, the
action of the Lutheran First Book
upon the missal; 2d, the Zuinglian
Second Book upon the First Book;
3d, the compromise of 1662.

1549, in 1552, and was

</p>

<p>
Canon Estcourt's argument against
the validity of Anglican orders is no
argument from lack of sufficient intention
on the part of Anglicans.
Neither do we think that such an argument
could be maintained, in accordance
with the commonly-accepted
principles of theology. If it is a
sufficient intention for valid baptism to
intend to administer the form of Christian
initiation, it is sufficient, in the case
of orders, to intend to administer the
form of Christian ordination, although
the ceremony in either case may be
regarded as merely an external form
without any intrinsic value. It is
only as a witness to the sense of the
form that the intention of Anglicans
is brought into court; and it is not
the intention with which they ordain
at which we demur, but the intention
with which they have altered the ordination
service and liturgy&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the
form of ordination and its context.
Had these alterations been merely
the result of an antiquarian leaning
towards a more primitive though less
perfect utterance of the same truth,
or of a puritanic craving after simplicity,
the irreverence would have
been of the extremest kind, but still
there would have been no grounds
for disputing the orthodox sense, and
so the validity of the form. But, on
the contrary, the very object of the
alterations, as Canon Estcourt has
shown, was the elimination of the
orthodox doctrines of priesthood and
sacrifice, and therefore of the significance
upon which the validity of the
form depends.
</p>

<p>
The doubts which should beset
the minds of honest Anglicans on the
subject of their orders, if they have
the least scruple as to the orthodoxy
of their position, are simply overwhelming.
If they turn to the early
church, they find that there are at
least as many precedents and authorities
for regarding as null the ordinations
<pb n='616'/><anchor id='Pg616'/>
of heretics and schismatics as
for accepting them. Morinus' opinion
is that such ordinations are invalid,
except where the church has
thought fit to dispense with the impediment;
and Morinus is a genuine
student of antiquity, and no mere
controversialist. True it is Anglicans
may appeal to what is undeniably
the more common doctrine
in the Roman Church&mdash;viz., that
such ordinations are valid&mdash;but then
she unflinchingly condemns Anglicans,
whereas she has never condemned
Morinus. It is nothing to the purpose
to say that the practice of the
church prevents her using Morinus'
opinion against Anglicans&mdash;which is
begging the question against Morinus;
the point is, Can Anglicans escape
using it against themselves?
Again, when they direct their attention
to the special facts of their own
history, their view is to the last degree
discouraging. Their latest antagonist,
Canon Estcourt, has notoriously
given up to them every point
to which they could make the remotest
claim, and has broken and thrown
away every weapon to which the
least exception could be taken; and
yet it has come to this: that their
only title to orders is a succession
probably broken by the non-consecration
of Barlow, and an ambiguous
form which, when read in the light
of their mutilated ordinal and liturgy,
is unlike any that has been accepted
as even probably adequate either by
East or West.
</p>

<p>
Even if Anglicans could find their
identical form, as far as words go, in
approved ordinals, they could not
argue from this the sufficiency of
their own form. Mutilation and involution,
although they contract within
the same span, can never be identical.
You might as well pretend
that there is no difference between a
stamen from which you have plucked
the leaves and an undeveloped
bud.
</p>

<p>
It is true that originally different
portions of the church were allowed,
in regard to orders, to give expression
to the same truth in various
forms with various degrees of explicitness;
but this can afford no precedent
to an individual church for mutilating
a common form in order to
deny a common truth.

<p>
The Abyssinian Decision.
</p>

<p>
We cannot conclude our review
without noticing an important criticism
made upon our author in the
shape of a letter to the <hi rend='italic'>Month</hi>, November-December,
1873, by the Rev.
F. Jones, S.J. F. Jones, whilst expressing
his thorough concurrence
with Canon Estcourt in every other
particular, thinks that he has attached
an undue force to the decision
of the holy office upon Abyssinian
orders.
</p>

<p>
Canon Estcourt has understood
the Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition,
in their decree in 1704, to have
ruled that the form, <q>Accipe Spiritum
Sanctum,</q> understood in the sense
of the Abyssinian liturgical books,
is valid for the priesthood, although,
in the particular case, no further expression
is given to this sense, at
least no expression within the limits
of the form strictly so called&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the
verbal formula synchronous with the
matter. The decree which he so
understands is as follows:
</p>

<p>
Question: <q>The ordainer passed
hurriedly along a line of deacons, laying
his hands upon the head of each,
and saying, <q>Accipe Spiritum Sanctum</q>;
are they validly ordained <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>in
tal modo e forma</foreign>, and admissible to
the exercise of their orders?</q> Answer:
<q>The ordination of a priest
with the imposition of hands and utterance
of the form as in the question
is undoubtedly valid.</q>
</p>

<pb n='617'/><anchor id='Pg617'/>

<p>
F. Jones, whilst allowing that
Canon Estcourt's interpretation is
the natural one according to ordinary
canons of criticism, insists that the
decree, <q>when interpreted in the
light of certain rules which arise out
of what is called the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>stylus curiæ</foreign>,</q>
asserts, indeed, the sufficiency of the
imposition of hands as matter, when
used with the form, but does not define
the sufficiency of the particular
form, <q>Accipe Spiritum Sanctum.</q>
</p>

<p>
The rules in question are as follows:
1. The meaning of the answer depends
upon the meaning of the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>dubium</foreign>.
2. Nothing but what is directly
stated is decided. 3. <q>If there is
anything in the wording of a decision
which appears inconsistent with the
teaching of an approved body of theologians&mdash;such
teaching as amounts
to a true theological probability&mdash;the
decision is to be interpreted so as to
leave such teaching intact, unless
the decision should itself show that
it intended to condemn that teaching,
and to take away that probability.</q>
4. Such decisions are formed
on the presumption that every
point except the one in question is
correct, on the maxim, <q>Standum
est pro valore actûs.</q> 5. When the
validity of an ordination is the subject-matter
of a decision, it must be
assumed that the decision has been
made after an inspection of the ordinal.
6. <q>It is hardly safe to allege
the authority of a decision (I speak
merely of a curial decision), particularly
when the details of the case are
but imperfectly known to us, without
having ascertained the sense in
which, after its promulgation, it was
understood by those who were most
competent to measure its importance.</q>
We shall examine these
rules when we come to consider the
worth of F. Jones' application of
them to the case in hand. But first
it will be well to see what effect the
elimination of the Abyssinian decision
would have upon Canon Estcourt's
controversial position.
</p>

<p>
Pp. 158-163. Canon Estcourt considers
various objections made by
Catholic controversialists to the Anglican
form of the priesthood. He
is considering the question of the
form in its strict sense&mdash;viz., that portion
of the ordination formulary which
is synchronous with the matter, whether
this last consist in the tradition of
the instruments or in the imposition
of hands. One objection urged by
Lequien, amongst others, is grounded
upon the very common doctrine that
the form of priestly ordination must
express the principal effect of the sacrament
of order by making mention
of the priesthood in relation to the
sacrifice, which is its principal object.
Now, if, as F. Jones suggests was the
case, the unmutilated Coptic rite
was in use in Abyssinia up to 1704,
and the examples given by Ludolf
and Monsignor Beb are merely imperfect
copies; and if no decision as
to the form was given in 1704, then,
so far as anything has been shown
to the contrary, Lequien's objection
holds good that no approved form
for the priesthood fails to make an
appeal to the Holy Sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
And now as regards F. Jones'
rules for interpreting the <q>stylus curiæ,</q>
and their application to the
Abyssinian decision. We have no criticism
to make upon Rules 1 and 2.
They are sufficiently obvious even to
a non-expert. Rule 3 cannot, we
think, be admitted without qualification.
It is no doubt an important
principle that the presumption is in
favor of an interpretation which
leaves intact a probable opinion, supposing
that this is not the formal
subject of the decision; but we must
not do violence to the natural sense
of words, and it is quite possible that
such a decision might completely
<pb n='618'/><anchor id='Pg618'/>
evacuate the probability of an opinion
of which it took no direct cognizance
whatever. The Council of
Florence did not directly intend to
condemn the opinion requiring as
absolutely necessary the tradition of
the instruments, yet effectively it has
done so. As to Rule 4, <q>Standum
est pro valore actûs,</q> its application
to the case before us must depend
upon whether the course indicated is
equivalent to the introduction of a
new <q>actus.</q> To ask, as the dubium
does, concerning the validity of <q>tal
modo e forma,</q> implies that this is
given in its integrity. In the Abyssinian
case, it was a question whether
certain persons were to be allowed
to say Mass and perform other priestly
functions, and the Sacred Congregation
allowed them. As to Rule 5,
no doubt an inspection of the ordinals
is to be presumed; but here the
very contention of the questioner is
that the ordinal had not been followed.
Moreover, there was ample
evidence, in the sacred books quoted
by Ludolf and Monsignor Beb, accessible
to the Sacred Congregation,
and which, according to F. Jones'
principle, we may assume it had before
it, that in Abyssinian hands the
Coptic ritual had been seriously
tampered with. The translation
from the Abyssinian, as given by the
above-named writers, is certainly not
an imperfect version of the Coptic,
but a deliberate compilation from the
Coptic form and that of the apostolic
constitutions, which would hardly
have been made except for ritual
purposes.
</p>

<p>
If we may accept the earliest and
most precise evidence as to actual
practice in Abyssinia&mdash;that of the
missionary Francis Alvarez (1520),
the one prayer used by the Abuna,
with the imposition of hands, is not
the form <q>Respice,</q> but, in the Coptic
tongue, the prayer <q>Divina gratia
quæ infirma sanat.</q><note place='foot'>See M. Le Grand, <hi rend='italic'>Dissert. de Ord. Abyss.</hi>,
p. 361, translated by S. Johnson.</note> But these
words, as Canon Estcourt points out,
p. 181, <q>in the <hi rend='italic'>Coptic</hi> and Jacobite
rites, are said by the archdeacon or
one of the assisting bishops. In the
Nestorian and ancient Greek, they are
said by the bishop without imposing
his hands; and only in the modern
Greek, the Maronite, and the Armenian
are they united with the imposition
of hands.</q> This looks as if the
Abyssinian ritual was a complete
medley.
</p>

<p>
This view is borne out by F.
Godigno, S.J. (<hi rend='italic'>De Abyssin. Rebus</hi>,
p. 224), who tells us that the Jesuit
Patriarch of Abyssinia, Oviedo, as
long as he lived in Æthiopia, always
doubted very much, and with good
reason, if the Abyssinian priests had
been duly and lawfully ordained,
inasmuch as the forms of consecration
used by the Abuna <hi rend='italic'>were so uncertain
that they seemed to have been corrupted</hi>.
On which account, in those matters
which belong to orders, and which
require in the minister a real character,
he never could persuade himself
to use their offices, lest haply the
sacraments should be rendered
void.
</p>

<p>
F. Jones thinks that Assemani
would certainly have noticed these
corruptions, had they existed, in his
<hi rend='italic'>Controversia Coptica</hi>, composed for
the information of Propaganda in
1731. But Assemani was not called
upon to consider the corruptions of
Abyssinia; for, as he tells us in his
preface, the occasion of his writing
was the conversion of two Egyptian
monks of the Alexandrian Church,
of whose reordination there was
question.
</p>

<p>
As to Rule 6, obviously nothing
can be more important than the estimate
of a decision expressed by
contemporary theologians; but it is
<pb n='619'/><anchor id='Pg619'/>
very easy to misinterpret their silence.
In his defence of the Coptic rite,
urges F. Jones, Assemani ought to
have quoted the authorization of a
form which <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>à fortiori</foreign> authorized the
Coptic. We reply that Assemani had
no lack of far more obvious and
splendid instances of the recognition
of the Coptic rite; that he had no
need of such indirect support. The
examination of the Abyssinian monk
Tecla Maria, in 1594, sufficiently
shows that it was impossible to judge
of Abyssinian ordinations by the
Coptic rite. Assemani himself acknowledges,
p. 227, that either Tecla
Maria's memory failed him, or his ordainers
must have been <q>poco pratici
del rito Coptico o l'avessero in
qualche parte alterato.</q> F. Godigno
(l. c.) says that the reason of Tecla
Maria's reordination was the corruption
of the rite. On the other hand,
it is clearly a great exaggeration to
say that the missionaries made nothing
of Abyssinian orders, and that
the motive of reordination was the
non-tradition of the instruments.
Of John Bermudes, the first of the
Jesuit patriarchs, Ludolf (pars. ii. p.
473) tells us that he (Bermudes) has
recorded in so many words, that he
received all the sacred orders, including
the episcopate, with right of succession
to the patriarchate, from the
Abuna Mark, under condition that
the pope would confirm it, and that
the pope confirmed and ratified all
Mark's acts. Again, the Portuguese
De Francia, one of the negotiators
for the Jesuits, tells the Abyssinian
king that he had been taught that,
if he is in danger of death, and cannot
get a Catholic priest, he must
ask the Abyssinians for communion.<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Godigno</hi>, 1 c. p. 327.</note>
</p>

<p>
Certainly, this Abyssinian decision
has not as yet made much mark in
theology. Canon Estcourt is able
to mention one work in which it occurs&mdash;a
certain edition of the theology
of Antoine, a Jesuit, and Prefect of
Propaganda under Benedict XIV.
But then there is a vast technical
difference, anyhow, between a decision
taking the shape of a practical rule
of procedure and a speculative definition.
For more than a century
after the Council of Florence, its
recognition of Greek orders had no
perceptible influence upon the language
of theologians concerning the
matter of the priesthood. It takes
time to translate from the language
of action into that of speculation;
but who can deny that in any fair
controversy such action must be
discounted.
</p>

<p>
It remains to be determined whether,
everything considered, the decision
of the Sacred Office admits of F.
Jones' interpretation; whether the
dubium can be understood, as he
suggests (p. 456), to turn exclusively
upon these two points: the non-tradition
of the instruments and the deviation
from the Coptic rite which prescribes
that the bishop's hands should
be imposed upon each <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ordinandus</foreign>
during the whole of the form Respice,
instead of during the one phrase,
<q>Repleeum Spiritu Sancto,</q> which F.
Jones thinks the missionaries paraphrased
by <q>Accipe Spiritum Sanctum.</q>
Now, we must say that it is
hardly probable that in 1704 the missionaries
should be seriously exercised
about the non-tradition of the instruments.
Neither is it likely that they
should have proposed, in the same
breath, the two difficulties suggested
by F. Jones; for why should deviation
from a rite, the substantial validity
of which they doubted, be a difficulty?
They ask about the validity
of a form and a manner of imposing
hands, which they describe <q>talmo do
e forma.</q> There may have been
other prayers used in the service
<pb n='620'/><anchor id='Pg620'/>
from the Coptic ordinal and liturgy,
but the dubium excludes them from
<q>tal forma.</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Jones' notion that the <q>Accipe
Spiritum Sanctum</q> is a mistranslation
of the Coptic <q>Reple eum Spiritu
Sancto</q>&mdash;which is not found in the
Abyssinian version&mdash;is, we think, quite
untenable. No distinction was more
thoroughly appreciated on both sides
than that between an imperative and
a precatory form. The Patriarch of
the Maronites, in 1572, informs the
pope: <q>In our Pontifical, the orders
are conferred without a form by
way of prayer.</q><note place='foot'>Assemani, <hi rend='italic'>Controv. Copt.</hi>, p. 185.</note> In 1860, the missionaries
inform the Sacred Congregation
<q>that the Monophysites believe
the essence of ordination consists
in the expiration (<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>insuflazione</foreign>)
the ordainer makes in the act of saying,
<q>Accipe Spiritum Sanctum.</q></q><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Estcourt</hi>, Append. xxxiv.</note>
Amongst the various deviations from
the Coptic rite which Assemani notes
in the evidence of Tecla Maria, the
Abyssinian says of his ordainer, <q>Insufflavit
in faciem meam.</q> This
<q>insufflatio</q> almost implies an imperative
form, and so far isolates the
words from any precatory formularies
that may precede and follow
them. Most probably this form was
obtained from the missionaries with
whom the Abyssinians had been so
long in intercourse.
</p>

<p>
Doubtless the Sacred Congregation
did not sanction the form <q>Accipe
Spiritum Sanctum</q> taken by
itself simply, but specificated in the
sense of the Abyssinian liturgy; but
this is exactly Canon Estcourt's contention
against Anglicans.
</p>

<p>
In spite of F. Jones' shrewd and
interesting observations, we are of
opinion that Canon Estcourt's appreciation
of the Abyssinian decision
is the true one. At any rate, his interpretation
is sufficiently probable
to make it most important to show
that, even so understood, it cannot
sanction Anglican orders.
</p>

<p>
Postscriptum
</p>

<p>
Since the above was written, the
discussion has been continued in the
<hi rend='italic'>Month</hi> by an answer from Canon
Estcourt in January, and an elaborate
rejoinder by F. Jones in February.
Something of what we have
written has been anticipated; but, on
the whole, we have thought it better
to leave our article as it stands, and
content ourselves with appending
such further remarks as may seem
called for.
</p>

<p>
F. Jones, in his second letter, insists
that Canon Estcourt has mistaken
what the missionaries proposed
as a solitary deviation from a well-known
and approved rite for the
whole form used on the occasion.
He proceeds to support his position
by italicizing the concluding words
of the answer of the Holy Office allowing
the missionaries to admit the
person so ordained <q>to the exercise
of his orders <hi rend='italic'>according to the rite, approved
and expurgated, in which he
was ordained</hi>.</q> <q>The Holy Office,
then,</q> he argues, <q>did not suppose
that the Abyssinians were ordained
with only the words, <q>Accipe Spiritum
Sanctum,</q> but presumed that some rite,
and that an <emph>approved</emph> rite, had been followed.</q>
</p>

<p>
Now, it is quite certain that the
schismatical Abuna did not make
use of a rite expurgated and approved
by the Holy See; therefore the
word <q>rite</q> must refer to the sacerdotal
rite to the exercise of which the
person in question was ordained,
which rite he might use in its expurgated
and approved form; but
whether the bare words, Accipe Spiritum
Sanctum, were used, or the fuller
Abyssinian or Coptic forms, the
priest would have been ordained in
<pb n='621'/><anchor id='Pg621'/>
that rite with a view to the exercise
of which he had been ordained.
</p>

<p>
As to the question whether the
Æthiopic liturgy, as distinct from the
Coptic, was approved, we cannot
admit that a conclusion in the negative
can be drawn from the passage
F. Jones quotes from the encyclical
of Benedict XIV. The
pope lays down that the Oriental
churches in communion with Rome
consist of four rites&mdash;Greek, Armenian,
Syrian, and Coptic; but he is
clearly only giving general heads.
The Æthiopic, if approved, might
well have been included under the
Coptic. The Melchite and Chaldaic
liturgies are approved; but in
this enumeration they are not distinguished
from the Syrian and the
Greek, of which they are respectively
slight variations. Further on in this
encyclical, the pope says that
<q>Greeks, Maronites, Armenians,
Copts, and Melchites had been given
churches in Rome, in order that
they may perform their sacred offices
each according to his rite.</q> We
know that the Abyssinians also had
a church in Rome, where we may
assume that they were allowed the
same privilege. The fact that an
expurgated edition of the Æthiopic
liturgy was brought out in Rome in
1549 goes some way to show that
the liturgy was approved.<note place='foot'>See Le Brun, <hi rend='italic'>Explic. Miss.</hi> (Venice, 1770
tom. ii. p. 273).</note> This was
the first of the Oriental liturgies published
in Rome, and may be found
in various editions of the <hi rend='italic'>Bibliotheca
Patrum</hi> (Paris, 1624, tom. vi.), together
with the Æthiopic rite of
baptism and confirmation. This rite
of confirmation affords a curious example
of the unprincipled variations
of Æthiopic ritual. It is almost the
same as the Coptic rite published by
Assemani, to which F. Jones refers,
but it carefully eliminates the direct
form, <q>Accipe Spiritum Sanctum,</q>
wherever it occurs in the Coptic.
</p>

<p>
We are inclined to believe that the
Abuna sometimes ordained in the
Coptic, sometimes in the Abyssinian,
tongue; but we must confess that the
only direct testimony we have met
with on this point is in favor of the
Coptic. Still, whatever was the language
used, there is ample evidence
to show that the Abyssinians were in
the habit of materially diverging from
the Coptic ordinal. To the testimonies
of Oviedo and Alvarez, already
quoted, we may add that of F. Soller.
Referring to F. Bernat's correspondence,
he says that that father
discusses <q>the different rite of ordination
and other points of difference
between the Copts and Abyssinians.</q><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Act. Sanct. Junii</hi>., tom. v. p. 128.</note>
</p>

<p>
We submit that the Holy Office
had no grounds for assuming the use
of the Coptic, or, indeed, of any specific
ritual in the case brought before
them.

<q>There is no sense of desolation
greater than that produced by the
sight of a dismantled palace and a
deserted garden.</q> These were the
words with which Don Emidio
broke a long and somewhat sad
silence which had fallen on our little
party the day we went to Portici.
</p>

<p>
It is a long drive of four miles
on the rough pavement of huge
slabs common to Naples and its
environs. We passed over the bridge
where S. Januarius had gone forth
with cross and banners, incense and
choristers, to meet the torrents of
burning lava from Mount Vesuvius,
and arrest the destruction of
the city by prayer. It made me
shudder to think how very near
that destruction we had then been.
For, of course, if the lava had once
gone so far, there was no natural
reason why it should not do so
again, and even pass on further
still. That bridge is now hardly
outside the town. Indeed, town
succeeds town, and the whole way
from Naples to Portici is one long
street, chiefly consisting of villas
and handsome palaces, now sadly
neglected, but probably still containing
many treasures, and all
with more or less of garden ground
attached.
</p>

<p>
Portici is a royal palace; but for
years none of the royal family have
resided there, and it is used chiefly
for public offices. It is sad to
see these magnificent buildings left
nearly empty; and we can only
wonder at the extraordinary wealth
of the past when we reflect that
Portici is one only of many other
beautiful royal residences which
are no longer kept up. Even
Caserta, which is said to be the
largest palace in Europe, is all but
deserted. Don Emidio was telling
us an anecdote in connection
with it. Just before the revolution
of 1860 the palace had been
put in order, partially refurnished,
and redecorated, for the reception
of Francis II. and his bride, the
ex-King and Queen of Naples.
</p>

<p>
Amongst other valuable ornaments,
in one room the walls had
hangings attached with massive
gold <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>fleurs-de-lis</foreign>. When the revolution
broke out, a Neapolitan duke,
one of the very few of the really
noble families who turned traitor to
their king, was appointed to adapt
and readjust the palace for the
usurper. The whole matter was put
into his hands, in perfect confidence,
no doubt, that he would see it properly
carried out. For some time
the palace was closed to the public.
When again it was opened on certain
days, and those who had
known it before saw it again, they
observed that all the gold <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>fleurs-de-lis</foreign>
had disappeared. Of course
the fact provoked enquiry; but no
<pb n='623'/><anchor id='Pg623'/>
account of them was ever rendered,
and all researches proved fruitless.
No one doubted but that they had
been <q>annexed</q> by the liberal
aristocrat, but, equally, no one dared
call him to task. For as annexation
on a large scale was the
order of the day, it did not answer
to look too closely into minor examples
of the same. Nevertheless,
the story got whispered abroad,
and his reputation, in consequence,
was far less golden than the missing
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>fleurs-de-lis</foreign>.
</p>

<p>
One day the duke was standing
at a window in his own palace
overlooking the courtyard, when
a poor artisan, who had already
sent in his bill more than once,
came to request payment. The
duke, who thought, or pretended
to think, the charges in the bill were
exorbitant, began to upbraid and
scold the man from the window.
At the same moment the wife of
one of the men-servants of the establishment
was crossing the yard.
The duke called to her, exclaiming,
<q>It is a downright theft. But
these artisans are all thieves, are
they not, Donna Rafaele?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Your excellency is a better
judge of that than I am,</q> was the
reply, <q>since the greater ought to
know the lesser.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wonder how the duke took
it?</q> said I.
</p>

<p>
Don Emidio gave me a knowing
look, and shook his right hand
under his left elbow. We all
laughed; but no description can
convey the inimitable drollery of
Neapolitan pantomime. It is a
thousand times more eloquent than
words. What expression, such as
<q>to make yourself scarce,</q> or <q>to
skedaddle,</q> could convey what is
indicated by that wagging of the
straightened hand under the elbow?
You <emph>see</emph> the thief escaping. It is
the same in everything else. There
is a gesture for all the emotions
and most of the casualties of daily
life. No beggar tells you he is
hungry; but standing silently before
you, with a perfectly immovable
expression, he opens his mouth,
and points downwards with his
finger. A woman and half a dozen
children gathering round you,
and all doing the same thing, produces
an effect so curiously divided
between the ludicrous and the
pathetic that it is far harder to refuse
an alms than if the request
were made in downright words.
It is the same with the coachmen
of the hired public carriages. You
are driving rapidly along, and your
coachman passes another whom he
knows. In less than a second he
has conveyed to his friend full information
of where he comes from,
where he is going, and how soon
he will be back, probably concluding
with the amount of the fare for
which he has agreed to do the distance;
and all without a word being
uttered.
</p>

<p>
The Neapolitans carry the same
extraordinary pantomimic power
into all scenes and all places, including
the pulpit, or, more likely,
the platform, from which the priest
delivers his Lenten or Month of
Mary discourses. He walks to and
fro in the heat of his argument,
he sits down, and starts up again,
he weeps, and he even laughs. It
is often very striking; and it is so
natural, it belongs so essentially
to the genius of the people, that
it is never ridiculous, nor does it
seem out of place. Of course sometimes
it is done less well and gracefully
than at others; but it is too
thoroughly in unison with the
language and habits of the people
ever to appear incongruous.
</p>

<p>
We were sitting on the low wall
<pb n='624'/><anchor id='Pg624'/>
of the outer steps leading to the
tower entrance of a building at the
end of the Portici pleasure-grounds
when this conversation occurred.
The tower belongs, I believe, to an
observatory, and all around are the
stables, the barracks, and the appurtenances
of the palace, now
empty and silent. The grass grew
high and thick in the courtyard.
The deep-red blossoms of the wild
sorrel, with the sunlight shining
through them, looked like drops of
blood among the grass. The ox-eyed
daisies boldly faced the blue, glaring
sky. The low, long building
used for stables was in front of us.
Then a dark, dense wood of ilex
and cork-trees, like a strong, black
line. And beyond that no middle
distance was visible, but stark and
sudden rose the seamed and barren
sides of Mount Vesuvius. No
beneficent and tender white cloud
broke the intense, monotonous blue
of all the wide heavens. The sky,
the grim mountain, the black wood,
and the deserted stables&mdash;that was
all; bathed in sunshine, sparkling
with intense light, silent with
brooding heat, and unspeakably
desolate with a broad, unmodulated,
horrific beauty like the face of
the sphinx.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there came over me a
dim, weird feeling of the ancient
pagan world. There was an inner
perception and consciousness that
in some undefined way it was homogeneous
to the scene around me and
to unredeemed man. It was cruel
in its beauty; as poetic, but not
picturesque, beauty so often is.
</p>

<p>
I started up, and exclaimed,
<q>Let us get back. The old gods
are about this place, and I cannot
stay.</q>
</p>

<p>
Time has not effaced the impression,
and I can recall the inner
vision at any moment. Frank declared
we should come again, and
have a picnic there with the Vernons.
But I protested I would
not be of the party. <q>By the bye,
Jane,</q> said Frank, <q>why did Elizabeth
not come?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Because little Franceschiella
was buried this morning, and
neither Ida nor Elizabeth would
leave the poor mother; while
Helen remained to keep Mrs. Vernon
company.</q>
</p>

<p>
Franceschiella was a lovely child
of six years who had died of a
fever the day before. She was the
only child, and that fact, added to
her quite extraordinary beauty, had
made the trial doubly hard to bear
for her adoring parents. For, indeed,
it was little less than adoration
that Franceschiella received,
not only in her own home, but
from all her neighbors. We were
very much struck in this instance
by the poetic nature of the Italians.
The father was a <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>vignaiuolo</foreign>,
the mother did a little needle-work,
or took in washing; but no
nobleman's child was ever more
carefully bathed and dressed and
nourished than this one darling,
and that partly in consequence of
her angelic beauty and her infantine
charm. The little creature
ran every risk of being entirely
spoilt by the amount of petting
and flattery that she received on
all sides. On Sundays and holidays
they always dressed her in
white with a red coral necklace;
and the mother or the cousins
would weave a wreath of flowers
to crown her beautiful, golden hair,
that fell below her waist. She had
deep violet eyes with black lashes,
and a milk-white skin. She was
very forward for her age, and singularly
intelligent. But she was
surely never meant to live long in
this rough world. She came to it
<pb n='625'/><anchor id='Pg625'/>
like a stranger, and she remained
a stranger all the time of her brief
sojourn&mdash;as though some princess
from the distant lands of poetry
and romance had come for a brief
visit to dwell with common mortals.
There was an inexpressible refinement
in all the little creature's ways
which would have become a real
cross to her and the occasion of
endless trials had she lived long
enough to find the harsh side of
life ruffling her angel wings. It
was in mercy the child was taken
away before the period of white
frocks and fresh flowers had come
to an end. Life could have
brought to her nothing but temptation
and anguish. But of course
in proportion to her exceptional
nature was the despair of the poor
parents in seeing her fading before
their eyes. As little Franceschiella
had been unaccustomed to restraint
or coercion of any kind, it
was exceedingly difficult, during
her short illness, to induce her to
take the necessary remedies. And
nothing could be more touchingly
beautiful than the arguments used
by the distracted parents to persuade
her to swallow the nauseous
draughts. As usual, there was a
crucifix near the bed, and an image
of the Mater Dolorosa&mdash;the devotion
of the Neapolitans being very
specially to the Seven Sorrows of
the Blessed Virgin. They would
beg the poor little darling to take
her medicine in honor of Our
Lord's thirst on the cross, or of
Our Lady's anguish when His dead
form was laid in her arms. And
these were not unmeaning or merely
mystical phrases, to which the
child could attach but little sense.
They were as household words
to her; familiar to her childish
thoughts from the moment she
could lisp, and woven into her life
as the mysteries of the faith only
are in lands altogether Catholic.
But nothing was to avail to keep
the pretty human flower from
fading fast. And before a week
had past little Franceschiella had
taken flight ere any of the ugliness
of mortal life had tarnished her
sweet loveliness. They crowned
her with roses, and laid her, dressed
in white, in the little wooden coffin
filled with flowers. Then they
flung handfuls of colored sugar-plums
over her, and placed a white
camellia between her still red lips,
saying, as they did so, <q>She breathes
flowers.</q> And so they carried her,
in the open bier, the uncovered,
lovely face turned towards the
heavens, and thus laid their darling
in the dark grave, but in
the full hope of a bright resurrection.
</p>

<p>
The mother's anguish was extreme.
The Neapolitan women are
an excitable and highly nervous
race; which arises, no doubt, in
great measure from the climate, as
every stranger knows who finds the
effect produced on his nerves by
this intoxicating atmosphere, which
I have heard compared to drinking
champagne. As in the case of the
peasantry much self-control has
not been inculcated, the result
is the frequency of terrible nervous
attacks producing convulsions&mdash;what
we should probably
designate as very aggravated hysteria.
After Franceschiella's death
the mother became subject to these
attacks, and seemed incapable of
receiving any consolation till heaven
granted her the hope of again
becoming a mother. On the day
we went to Portici the Vernons
had hardly left her. And it was
very charming to see the Christian
sense of equality on their side, and
the deference and gratitude shown
<pb n='626'/><anchor id='Pg626'/>
them by their peasant neighbors on
the other.
</p>

<p>
But why did Frank so particularly
ask why Elizabeth had not
come, instead of asking equally
about Ida and Helen?
</p>

<p>
<q>You have, then, seen Medusa
in the woods of Portici, Miss
Jane?</q> said Don Emidio suddenly
to me, as we were driving home
in absolute silence.
</p>

<p>
I looked up out of my brown
study to find his eyes fixed upon
me. <q>Do you mean that I am
changed to stone?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are as silent as one.</q>
</p>

<p>
I laughed, and said, <q>At least,
thank heaven, I am not <foreign rend='italic'>malheureuse
comme les pièrres</foreign>,<note place='foot'>As unhappy as the stones.</note> as the French
say, though I may be as silent as
they. I did not, however, see anything
in those dark ilex groves. I
only suddenly felt the awfulness of
nature when you look at her in all
her inexorable beauty, with the
rhythm of her apparently changeless
laws and her sublime disdain of
man. She breathes and blossoms,
she burns and thunders, she weeps
and smiles, utterly independent of
us all. She knows no weakness;
no decay touches her but such as
she can repair. She embraces
death, that she may produce life.
She is ever fertile, ever lavish of herself
and of her gifts. But she never
<emph>cares</emph>. Her mountains are granite
even to the feet of her Creator, as
he climbs the heights of Calvary.
Her noontide heavens are brass to
the cravings of man's heart in his
midday toil. She will not pause in
the twenty-four hours of her inevitable
day, though sundown should
bring death to one and despair to
many again and again. She treads
her ever-victorious march over ruined
nations, buried cities, and broken
hearts. Oh! I could hate her&mdash;cruel
power, terrible Pythoness;
mocking me with sunshine, scaring
me with storms; ever rejoicing in
her strength, ever regardless of me.
I cannot explain why these thoughts
came to me, as across the dark
wood I traced the violet scars on
awful Vesuvius, and heard the low
whispers of the wind in the long
grass at our feet. Suddenly faith
seemed to die out of me. I forgot
what I believe; and back came
trooping the pagan gods and the
pagan world, with the strong feeling
that pantheism is the inevitable
religion of the natural man, and
that were I not, thank God, a
Christian and a Catholic, some form
of it would grow into my mind, as
the impress left by the face of nature.
For a moment a dark cloud
overshadowed me while I looked
into the depths of the old pagan
belief; and it became so real to me
that I shuddered. It has left me
silent; that's all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's all!</q> repeated Don
Emidio with a sly smile, and imitating
my voice in a way that I
half thought was rather impertinent.
<q>Allow me to tell you that
I think that is a great deal. I do
not imagine there are many young
ladies who come out for a day's
pleasuring to the gardens of Portici
or elsewhere, and indulge in such
profound reflections as you do.</q>
</p>

<p>
I looked round, and saw that
Frank and Mary were listening.
</p>

<p>
Frank said: <q>I believe Jane is
quite right; and she has so well
described the effect which the aspects
of nature produce on the
mind of man that I am convinced
her words embody and express the
riddle of the sphinx. The laws of
nature, taken without the doctrine
of the Incarnation, which alone is
the keystone to the whole creation,
<pb n='627'/><anchor id='Pg627'/>
form the enigma which is put before
us to understand and answer;
failing which, we perish.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But all paganism was a falsified
adumbration of the Incarnation;
the gods for ever assuming a human
form, and the men becoming
gods,</q> said Mary. <q>It had that
germ of truth in it which every system
must have to be built at all,
no matter in what monstrous form.
But it required revelation to tell us
that the <q>Word was made flesh and
dwelt amongst men.</q> And that alone
explains nature. She is the herald,
the servant, or rather the slave, of
Him by whom and for whom all
things were created. She speeds
on her way in the full vigor of those
laws which were impressed upon
her as she first sprang from the hand
of her Creator. She does not stop
to share our griefs or our joys, for
she has a higher mission. But she
has ceased to be terrible to us, for
faith has unveiled her face, and her
harmonious forces no longer scare
us by their inexorable relentlessness.
Her one mission is to sing of God,
and repeat to Time the refrain of
Eternity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, then, do we sometimes pine
for her sympathy?</q> said I.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! Miss Jane,</q> exclaimed Don
Emidio, <q>that is because we are for
ever looking for sympathy in the
wrong place and from the wrong
people.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not always,</q> I replied. What
made me say so? And why did
Don Emidio change color and look
at me so fixedly? I was still wondering
when we reached home.
</p>

<p>
Mary and I were, as usual in the
evening, sitting in the <foreign rend='italic'>loggia</foreign>. But
Frank was not with us, and I missed
his genial talk and the odor of
his cigar.
</p>

<p>
<q>What has become of Frank
this evening, Mary?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He has gone down to see the
Vernons, and said he should persuade
them to come to us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I hope he will succeed, for I do
not like his spending his evenings
away from us. This is not the
first nor the fourth time he has gone
to Casinelli as soon as he got up
from dinner.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! well, Jane, we must not be
selfish. He has his life to live, as
you have yours; and I must expect
one day to lose you both.</q>
</p>

<p>
I felt my heart stop, and then
beat violently. What did Mary
mean? And why did some veil
seem suddenly to fall from my eyes?
It was some moments before 1
spoke; and then I tried to say in
my ordinary voice: <q>You have
some presentiment about Frank,
Mary. What is it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have presentiments about both
of you. But I do not want to
force your confidence.</q>
</p>

<p>
In a moment I was kneeling by
her side. <q>Dearest Mary, do you suppose
I have any secrets from you?
I tell you everything. If I do not
tell you more, it is because I know
no more.</q> It was a sudden impulse,
dim but overwhelming, which made
me add those strange words. Mary
looked at me intently. <q>Has it
never struck you that Frank has
a reason for going so often to the
Villa Casinelli, as Emidio has a
reason for coming so often here?</q>
</p>

<p>
Our eyes met for one moment.
Then I hid my face in my hands,
and burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Mary! what bitter-sweet
things are you saying? I do not
want to lose Frank, and I do not
want to leave you, or to tread in
other paths than those I have
known since my childhood. Are
you sure it is so? Why have I not
known it till now? And even now
I doubt.</q>
</p>

<pb n='628'/><anchor id='Pg628'/>

<p>
<q>That is because you were not
in the least looking out for it, and
were absorbed in other thoughts,
preventing that retrospection which
would have shown you that Emidio's
manner towards you has been
intensifying with every day of our
stay here. And now what answer
will you give when the time
comes?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do not ask me yet, dear Mary.
I must have leisure to reflect. At
this moment my heart is more full
of Frank and Elizabeth than of
anything else.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! my dear, he could not have
made a wiser choice; she is a girl
after my own heart, so true, so
tender, so good, and so utterly unselfish.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I only hope she will not spoil
Frank.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am not afraid of that, for she
has a high sense of duty for herself
and for all who approach her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what is to become of Ida
and of you, Mary?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot think,</q> said Mary
with a sweet, sad smile. <q>But I
suppose we shall both of us be
happy in the happiness of those
who are so dear to us. It is worse
for me than for her. She loses a
sister. I lose a brother and sister
both.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't know that, Mary.
Nobody has proposed to me, and,
if somebody did, I am not certain
what answer I should give.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I am,</q> rejoined Mary.
</p>

<p>
I clapped my hand over her
mouth, exclaiming, <q>Don't say it,
Mary dear. Let me be free and
feel free. I am frightened at the
thought of promising myself to any
one, even where I may feel I could
love.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Be free, dear sister, until the
moment has come when you are
sure it is God's will you should
enter on another phase of woman's
destiny.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And may I never do so, except
to accomplish his will!</q> I replied;
and with one long kiss on dear
Mary's brow I turned away, for we
heard approaching footsteps.
</p>

<p>
Frank and Elizabeth entered
first. Ida and Padre Cataldo followed.
I looked to see if there
were a fifth figure behind, and was
rather relieved to find Don Emidio
was not there. I needed time to
collect my thoughts before I saw
him again. Perhaps, after all, Mary
was mistaken, and attached more
importance to this matter than was
necessary. At any rate, I was in
no hurry to see Don Emidio again.
</p>

<p>
Frank seemed in high spirits, and
Elizabeth looked serenely, calmly
happy. Her soft manner and her
slow, graceful movements had long
ago won for her the nickname of
Pussy; particularly as her velvet
ways were not unmixed with a
playful slyness; so that from time
to time she came out with some remark
far more acute and incisive
that at first you would have given
her credit for. It was a relief to
me when I heard Frank say that
he had been particularly anxious to
induce Padre Cataldo to join us,
because he had promised to give us
the account of an unfortunate man
whose execution he had attended
some years ago in the course of his
priestly ministrations. Ida was
looking as thoughtful as Mary;
and I saw her eyes constantly
wandering to where Frank and
Elizabeth were sitting together.
We were all too preoccupied to
talk, but were very glad to listen
to a long story.
</p>

<p>
<q>Frank tells us, reverend father,</q>
began Mary, <q>that some
twenty years ago you attended the
execution of a poor criminal. It
<pb n='629'/><anchor id='Pg629'/>
would interest us very much if you
would give us the particulars. In
what part of Italy did it occur?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It took place in the Basilicata,</q>
replied the father, <q rend='pre'>and the whole
province was filled with consternation;
for the culprit did not belong
to the lower ranks of life, but was a
gentleman by birth, education, and
position. He was the proprietor
of a château and a considerable
patrimony near one of the towns
of the province, and his crime was
the murder of his own brother.
For many generations the family
had had an undesirable reputation
for deeds of violence and sudden
acts of rage or revenge. It was
not the first time that the history
of the family chronicled some
bloody act; though it was the first
time, at least in modern days, that
any member of this unfortunate
house had suffered the utmost penalty
of the law. I am unable to
tell you what gave rise to the violent
feeling of hatred which the
elder brother entertained for the
younger. There had been many
quarrels and disputes between them
from their boyhood upwards.
Frank told me the other day you
had been talking about the extraordinary
power the Italian, and
especially the native of Southern
Italy, has of following out one design
through all obstacles and difficulties,
silently and secretly, for
years. If they possess this tenacity
of character in the search for
wealth, I am afraid they have it
equally in questions of revenge.
And for some reason or other this
had been the sentiment of Conte
Falcone for his brother, Don Carlo.
One day Don Carlo was found
stabbed through the heart, and
suspicion immediately fell on Conte
Falcone. He was arrested, but the
trial was a long one, and some
months were passed in collecting
evidence. At length he was convicted,
and from the moment of
his condemnation made no attempt
to deny his guilt. At that
time the prison at Potenza, where
he was to await his execution, was
under the direction of a Jesuit father,
whose efforts were ceaseless
for the good of the unfortunate
criminals under his charge.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Naturally, Conte Falcone was a
special object of care and anxiety,
from the enormity of his crime, and
from the fact that his position and
circumstances are generally in
themselves a guarantee against offences
of so deep a dye.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>No efforts were wanting on the
part of the Jesuit priest. He was
with his prisoner day and night,
endeavoring to bring him to a true
repentance of his sin against God
and against humanity. And he
succeeded. He found the count
from the first overwhelmed with
remorse, and his object was to
prevent this remorse degenerating
into despair, and thus excluding
the light of faith. Happily, Conte
Falcone, grievously as he had offended
against the laws of God,
had never given place to rationalistic
or scoffing doubts. It needed
but to transform the awful bitterness
of human remorse into the
tenderness of perfect contrition;
and this great work in the culprit's
soul was happily accomplished in
time to give him courage to bear
the dreadful intelligence that all
efforts made at the Court of Appeal
to get the sentence commuted had
entirely failed. This was an unusual
and remarkable fact, for capital
punishment is very rarely carried
out in Italy; many would tell
you not sufficiently for the protection
of society. Probably in this
case the judges were urged to unusual
<pb n='630'/><anchor id='Pg630'/>
severity by the position of
the criminal, lest it should appear
that, being a nobleman, he was less
severely dealt with than a common
man might have been. Moreover,
it was not forgotten that this was
the third time one of his unfortunate
family had taken the life of a
relation, and it was thought necessary
an example should be made.
The priest accordingly announced
to him that his fate was sealed, and
that the next morning he must proceed
on the terrible journey which
was to be his last.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the kingdom of Naples, as
well as in some other parts of Italy,
it is the law that the execution of
a criminal should take place on or
near the spot where the deed was
done.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What a terrible law of retribution!</q>
exclaimed Mary.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, and one strictly in conformity
with many passages of the
Holy Scriptures, and with the Biblical
spirit generally.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Has it not been supposed, father,</q>
asked Frank, <q>that possibly
after death the souls in purgatory,
as also the lost, suffer for their errors
there where they were guilty
of them?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is a common opinion, and
it goes far towards explaining the
accounts of strange noises and
spectral forms in places where it is
known there has been a murder.
The very sound of the fatal blow is
repeated through the hours of the
night, as though the disembodied
spirit were condemned for ever to
re-enact the semblance of that
crime which has grown into one
idea, one all-absorbing memory of
the past. The soul becomes, as it
were, the personification and essence
of its fatal crime.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What a fearful verification of the
worm that dieth not!</q> said Mary.
</p>

<p>
<q>But surely,</q> I exclaimed, <q>we
may have softer and happier feelings
about the souls in purgatory?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course we may,</q> replied the
father, almost smiling at my look
of horror and anxiety. <q>If they frequent
the scenes of their past, it is
not to inspire us with fear; for of
that dreadful passion they are now
themselves no longer capable, the
blessed security of their future annihilating
all touch of apprehension.
If they reappear to the living, it is
either to remedy some evil or to
solicit our prayers. I never could
understand the terror people have
of what they call ghosts.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It would be strange indeed,</q>
said Mary, <q>not to wish to see
again those we have loved and lost,
even their disembodied souls.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And yet it is not lawful to desire
it with ardor or to entreat for
it; because it is outside the bounds
of God's usual dealings with his
creatures to permit the dead to
revisit the living, or rather to reappear
to them; for I believe they
revisit us constantly, and probably
mostly dwell amongst us, unseen
and, alas! generally forgotten.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! no, not forgotten, dear father,</q>
said Mary, the tears filling
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not forgotten by such as you,
<foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>figlia mia</foreign>.<note place='foot'>My daughter.</note> But we have entered
on a subject which might keep us
discussing till midnight. I go
back to my poor penitent.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Was he your penitent from the
first, father? Were you the director
of the prison?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You have robbed me of my disguise,
<foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>cara figlia</foreign>.<note place='foot'>Dear daughter.</note> I meant to have
told you a story, but not to talk of
myself. However, it does not matter,
and I will lay aside all disguise.
The journey the unhappy count
<pb n='631'/><anchor id='Pg631'/>
had to make to his native place was
perhaps the most terrible part of
his punishment. But I had the
satisfaction of seeing him receive
the announcement with the greatest
resignation, once more offering it
as an atonement for his crime. As
he was a man of considerable refinement
and education, his resignation
arose from no lack of power
to appreciate the dreadful contrast
between his present position on returning
to his home and that which
he had once filled. It would be
impossible to put into words what
he felt on arriving to meet an ignominious
death at the place where
he had been the great man and the
most influential person. Early in
the morning of the dreadful day on
which we began our long journey
he was led out of the prison, and
mounted on an ass&mdash;such being the
law in that part of Italy. The
slow paces of the beast added considerably
to the torture of the
count's feelings, it being impossible
to hasten a progress every hour of
which seemed an age. He had
made his general confession to me
before that fatal morning, and constantly
on the road he would turn
to me for a word of consolation and
encouragement, or to renew his frequent
acts of contrition. I need
hardly say I never left his side for
a moment. Poor fellow! what an
agony the whole journey was to
him, and, from sympathy, hardly
less so to me; for he was bound
hand and foot, and the animal was
led by one of the guards, the others
following and surrounding him on
horseback. You know enough of
us Italians to be aware that, physically
and morally, we are more sensitively
constituted than any other
European nation. Our feelings are
extraordinarily keen, and our imaginative
powers excessive; and
these two qualities combine to give
us a most intense love of life. All
the incidents of our journey, which
occupied the entire day, must have
been, and indeed I can bear testimony
that they were, the perfection
of anguish to the count, such as
seldom can fall to the lot of any
man, taking his whole life together.
The sun poured its scorching rays
on his uncovered head; he, being
bound, could not in any way help
himself; and several times he turned
so faint that the guards had to
fetch water to revive him. I obtained
permission at last for his
poor head to be covered&mdash;all the
more so as I apprehended a sun-stroke.
I held the cup for him to
drink from, and sometimes supported
him for a few seconds in my
arms to relieve him as well as I
could from the restraint of his painful
position. It was nightfall when
our awful and melancholy procession
reached the prison of the
count's native town. His own château
was not far distant! I had
written to have a chapel prepared
in the prison; and in that chapel,
kneeling at the foot of the altar, he
whom I had come to love as the very
child of my soul spent the entire
night. Naturally, his first thought
on arriving was for his wife and
his two little children. And he
entreated to be allowed to see
them once more. I was not then
aware of what was the custom on
such melancholy occasions, and I
applied for permission to send for
the countess and her children.
But I found that they had been removed
from their home by the order
of the magistrates, and were
already at a considerable distance.
This had been done from motives
of humanity, that the poor wife
might not be almost within hearing
of the dreadful event which was
<pb n='632'/><anchor id='Pg632'/>
to take place on the morrow, or
his children grow up with a full
knowledge of their father's fate. It
was almost more than I myself
could bear when I had to return to
him in the prison, and tell him of
the ill-success of my request. It
was the last drop of extreme bitterness.
It was the vinegar and the
gall; the absolute isolation from all
that he had loved, the utter desolation
of his human affections. A
spasm of agony passed over his
face; but the only words he spoke
were, <q>The will of God be done.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>In the morning he again made
his confession with the ardent contrition
and fervor of a saint. He
heard a Mass as preparation for his
last communion. He received the
Blessed Sacrament at the second
Mass, and assisted at a third in
thanksgiving.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The dreadful moment was now
at hand. The horrid black limbs
of the fatal guillotine stood stark
and rigid against the bright morning
sky in the great public square
of the town.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Every church in the place was
thronged with worshippers, praying
and offering their communions for
the salvation of the poor soul so
soon to be wrenched from sweet
life, and sent to its everlasting
doom. The public square was also
filled with spectators&mdash;a silent, awe-struck
throng, while occasionally
a prayer would seem to quiver on
the air from the suppressed voice
of a hundred people.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>At length the count appeared,
supported by the guards; for by
that time he was in a very exhausted
state. His last act was to press
my hand in silence. It was the
signal for me to give him the last
absolution. I had just turned
aside, hardly conscious myself from
excess of feeling, when the fatal
knife fell. A cry of horror ran
through the crowd; and then immediately
they dispersed, many of
them repeating aloud the <hi rend='italic'>De profundis</hi>,
as they retired to their
homes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I always remember poor Falcone
in my daily Mass; though I cannot
say I think he is in any further
need of prayers, but is, I hope,
long since in a position to benefit
me by his.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is your opinion, father,</q>
asked Mary, <q>of public executions?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the present state of feeling
in Italy they are beneficial
rather than otherwise. I attended
the execution of two soldiers a few
years ago at Terracina. The
whole town was crowding to the
church the evening before, and at
an early hour on the day itself, to
pray for the poor men. It was
like the general communion at the
close of a mission; and those
who actually witnessed the execution
seemed to do so with no other
object than to assist the poor criminals
by their prayers. Many of
the women were on their knees in
the public place. And I do not
believe but that such a fervor of
devotion had a beneficial effect
upon all. It is, or at least it was,
the same thing in Rome. But
where, as in London and Paris,
that idea of intercessory prayer has
died out with the faith of which
it forms a part, and the vilest rabble
collects from a brutal curiosity
to see a man hung or guillotined,
then I am convinced that public
executions are demoralizing,
and tend to increase the crimes
they are meant to repress.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All I know is,</q> said Frank, suddenly
starting up, <q>if a fellow
could only have the good-luck to
be hung in the presence of a large
<pb n='633'/><anchor id='Pg633'/>
Italian crowd, I think he would
have a better chance of going
straight to heaven than by any
other death. I think I should like to
go in for that sort of thing myself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O Frank! what do you mean?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, this is what I mean: If
you have a long illness, you get
weak in mind and in the power of
volition, as well as weak in body.
I know, if I have only a headache,
how difficult it is to say my prayers.
Fancy, then, what it must be
through a long, painful illness.
Whereas, if you are going to be
hung, you have all your faculties
about you; you are in no doubt of
when you are going to die; the
time is fixed to the minute. You
have made your last confession;
and I can imagine being able then
to make such an act of perfect contrition,
with all the forces of one's
mind and soul, that would land one
safe past the realms of purgatory.
I often feel as if it would be my only
chance, and not a bad one, either.</q>
</p>

<p>
Padre Cataldo looked amused. Elizabeth
did not appear quite to like
it, and I overheard her say to him:
<q>I think you might manage to end
an honorable life in a more honorable
way, and secure heaven all the
same.</q> I thought I heard something
in reply about <q>with your
help and your example</q>; but I
did not listen, as I wanted to induce
Padre Cataldo to tell us about
his wonderful escape during the
revolution of 1860. I said something
to him about it; but he
turned it off, and Mary whispered
to me that he never liked to talk
about it, but that Don Emidio
knew all about it, and we could ask
him to tell us the next time we
met. Padre Cataldo now took
leave, Frank accompanying him
back, and promising to return for
the Vernons later.
</p>

<p>
As soon as they had left, Ida told
us that all their troubles and anxieties
in reference to the Casinelli and
the chapel bell had been renewed.
There had been an interregnum of
comparative peace, and we had
entertained the hope that all was
likely to go on quietly. But it
turned out that one of the sisters
some days previously had called on
Mrs. Vernon and her daughters to
explain that the bell ringing for
Mass was such a cause of annoyance
to the other lodgers that she really
must request that it should be entirely
given up. Of course Mrs.
Vernon refused. The chapel had
been conceded to them; Mass was
said there daily by the express
permission of the cardinal archbishop,
and was of the greatest
benefit to the neighborhood; and
she and her daughters absolutely
declined to sanction such an insult
to religion. Signorina Casinelli
proposed that the bell should be
hung somewhere in the garden at a
considerable distance. But this
also was refused. It was not rung
at an early hour. It was not a
large bell, and it was absurd to
have the chapel in one place, and
the chapel bell an eighth of a mile
away, to say nothing of the trouble
of sending some one to ring it.
Signorina Casinelli left the house
in high dudgeon; and the next day
she waylaid Padre Cataldo, as he
was returning through the garden
from visiting the sick. She flew
into a violent rage the moment she
saw him, and told him that, rather
than offend their other tenants, they
would, the house being their property,
shut up the chapel entirely.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, no written agreement
respecting the use of the
chapel existed between the Vernons
and the Casinelli; and it had
never entered any one's head that
<pb n='634'/><anchor id='Pg634'/>
they could be guilty of such a
transaction. The threat was, however,
only too well carried out.
That same evening the bell was cut
down and carried away. The
Vernons learnt from the <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>vignaiuoli</foreign>
in their neighborhood that the
Casinelli had had some difficulty
in finding any workmen who would
undertake the job. They had first
sent for a mason in their own employ;
but he had absolutely refused
to have anything to do with
a work which he considered as sacrilegious;
and turning to the <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>padrona</foreign>,
the eldest sister, he exclaimed,
<q>Judas also sold his Master
for money, but I will have nothing
to do with conduct which resembles
his. You may manage
your own affairs in your own way.</q>
</p>

<p>
The following Saturday they
completed their evil work by literally
doing as they threatened. A
message was sent to the Vernons
to warn them that they had better
take out of the chapel anything
therein which belonged to them
without loss of time, as that night
it was to be locked and the keys
withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
It was a sad office indeed for the
Vernons to have to strip the little
chapel of all its ornaments, the
work of their hands and their
hearts. They did it in silence,
and in silence they bore the heavy
trial; for had they allowed themselves
any expressions which would
have served as a cry for the peasantry
around, it would have been
difficult to restrain the grief and
indignation of these poor people
at finding themselves deprived of
their Mass and of the instructions
of a priest whom they all loved
as a father. Ida's delicate health
made it very difficult for her to
walk to any church up the high hill
at the foot of which Casinelli is
situated. Padre Cataldo had to go
elsewhere to say his Mass, to the
great inconvenience of himself and
others. But that was as nothing
compared to the grief of seeing all
his little flock dispersed.
</p>

<p>
Signore Casinelli informed his
tenant, in the presence of several
persons, that henceforth he might
consider himself master of the situation.
And so he has remained.
But the Casinelli have never since
been able to command the slightest
respect from the <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>vignaiuoli</foreign> and
peasantry of the neighborhood.
They have lost all prestige. And
long before these pages see the light
the Vernons will have left Casinelli
to establish themselves in one of
the many villas whose doors were
open to them from that moment.
All in the neighborhood wanted to
let their apartments to them and
Padre Cataldo; and if anything
could console them for all they
had had to sacrifice, it might be
the amount of sympathy and respect
which met them on all sides
and from all classes; while the
incident, far from diminishing Padre
Cataldo's field of usefulness, seemed
to have opened out fresh spheres
for him to work in, and to have
extended his influence far and
wide.
</p>

<p>
The garden in which our villa
of R&mdash;&mdash; R&mdash;&mdash; stood led by steps
and winding paths to a tiny bay
and to a long series of rocks and
large natural caves. There was
more than one bath, fed by the
fresh sea-water, in whose limpid
depths we not unfrequently saw
brilliant sea-anemones, and even
small fish which sometimes forced
their way through to the openings
left in an artificial dike to supply
the bath with water. Here and
there a wooden bridge was thrown
over some part where the water
<pb n='635'/><anchor id='Pg635'/>
broke the communication from one
cave to another. The views from
the wide, arched openings of the
caves were very lovely; Naples and
the bay on one side, and the flower-clad,
precipitous rocks of the coast
of Posilippo on the other. At
night the fishermen's boats which
had been moored in these caves,
and in others like them, came
gliding out with a lighted torch at
the prow. And all through the
night many of them might be seen,
with the black figures of two or
three fishermen dimly distinguished
from time to time; though more
generally all that can be seen is the
dark, shadowy form of the boat
and the flaring torch, intended to
attract the unwary fish into the net.
</p>

<p>
I should have liked the caves
better had they not been disfigured
by the stuffed, gaunt forms of a
hippopotamus and some alligators
and similar monsters, which were
placed in all sorts of unexpected
places, and seemed to meet you
round the corner with gaping jaws.
These caves had formed part of a
public place of resort some years
ago, but were now deserted and
forgotten, with all the monsters
rapidly falling into dusty decay.
</p>

<p>
We had been for some time at
the villa before my curiosity had
ever led me to explore this strange
place. When I did so, it was in
company with Don Emidio. But
as I protested that I did not like
crocodiles and hippopotami, he
suggested that we should climb the
rock outside the cave to the pretty
little pink and green kiosk which
crowned it, and which commanded
a lovely view from where it stood
embedded in aloes and cacti,
opuntias and zoccas, besides many
varieties of climbing plants. Nothing
could be prettier than the
winding paths, protected on one
side by a rustic fence, while every
cranny in the rock on the other side
bore some tuft of blossom or afforded
roothold for the wild tresses
of some flowering creeper.
</p>

<p>
Mary and Frank had remained
in the lower garden, while we wandered
into every nook and corner,
and finally sat down to rest inside
the kiosk, which, with windows all
round, presented to us a wide and
lovely scene.
</p>

<p>
It was here I consented to become
Don Emidio's wife.
</p>

<p>
That effected, no matter how or
in what words&mdash;for those things seldom
read wisely&mdash;I suggested that
we should rejoin Mary and Frank.
Don Emidio took the latter by the
arm, and walked with him a little
way apart. I remained silent, sitting
at Mary's feet. When Don
Emidio joined us, it was without
Frank. I asked where he was.
<q>Gone down to Casinelli,</q> was the
reply. I knew why. He was determined
to have his fate also decided
that same day, that same
hour. I had no doubts for him. I
knew that Elizabeth would consent;
and I felt partly glad, and partly
saddened at the thought that our
life, hitherto so united and bound
up in each other, was about to divide
and separate, each following
his or her own destiny, and weaving
a new web of life's joys and sorrows.
Don Emidio left us soon. But
long after, I saw him leaning over
the parapet of the road, waiting for
Frank to return from Casinelli, that
he might learn whether his wishes
also were to be crowned with success.
I could see the meeting from
my window, as the tall figures of
the two friends stood dark against
the deep blue of an Italian starlight
night. I could have no doubt
of the nature of the intelligence
conveyed by Frank to his friend;
<pb n='636'/><anchor id='Pg636'/>
for, to my horror, Don Emidio
threw his arms around him and
kissed him, as Italians do. Poor
Frank! thought I, how will he put up
with such an un-English proceeding?
No doubt it had happened to
Frank before; for he did not, so far
as I could judge at that distance,
start with astonishment. But it set
me thinking about my future husband's
foreign ways. And the next
morning, when Frank and I had
talked over the more serious questions
in our affairs, I found myself
drifting into that part of the matter.
<q>I wonder, Frank, if I shall ever get
quite reconciled to his Italian customs,
so as either not to notice, or
to prefer them?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is to be hoped so, since he
will be your husband. But what do
you mean in particular?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, you know he will call me
Miss Jane; any one else would say
Miss Hamilton.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is an evil which is already
at an end. No doubt for the future
he will call you simply Jane, and
speak of you a short time hence as
la Contessa Gandolfi.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then I wish he would not embrace
you, Frank.</q> Frank laughed
aloud.
</p>

<p>
<q>He would be hurt if I repulsed
him. They all do it. He will soon
see that in England it is not the
custom, and then he will give it up&mdash;at
least while there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Another thing is, I do not like
his wearing a large ring&mdash;though I
own it is a handsome one&mdash;on his
forefinger. We think that vulgar in
England.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And it does not happen to be
vulgar here; that is all about it, my
dear Jane. I am afraid I cannot
help you in that matter. But possibly
in time you will succeed in
bringing him round to your views;
though I doubt your ever being able
to break him of occasionally transferring
that ring from his finger to his
thumb whenever he is particularly
anxious to remember something.
When you see his palazzo in
Rome, you will find that he possesses
a beautiful portrait, by Vandyke,
of an ancestor on his mother's side.
That very ring is on the forefinger
of the portrait. Emidio is the living
image of that picture. And
you can hardly blame a man for
carrying out a likeness he has such
reason to be proud of.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is one other thing, Frank,
which strikes me as odd. If he is
sitting in the arm-chair when Mary
or I come into the room (and you
know we are not rich in arm-chairs
here), he never gives either of us
that chair, but fetches us another,
and goes back to the arm-chair himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Jane, you are a little fool. Do
you not know that in Italy, at least
in the south, it is the height of ill-breeding
to offer any one the chair
you have just occupied yourself?
A cool seat is always a desideratum
in this climate, even though it may
be a less luxurious one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Shall I ever, do you think, be
able to take back to England with
me a husband with such a name as
Emidio? What a pity he was not
christened Paul, or Stephen, or
even Anthony! But Emidio!</q> By
this time we were both laughing&mdash;Frank
at me, I at myself.
</p>

<p>
<q>You need never call him Emidio
in public. We call him so because,
when we have been travelling
about Italy alone together, we found
it convenient to drop his title. But
you know he is il Conte Gandolfi.
His mother was the only child of a
noble Roman family, and consequently
a great heiress. She married
a Neapolitan Conte Gandolfi;
and that is how it happens that
<pb n='637'/><anchor id='Pg637'/>
with a Neapolitan name his chief
residence is in Rome, in the palazzo
that belonged to his mother.
His father was not a man of very
considerable fortune, and his only
property here is his villa at Capo di
Monte, where he spends the summer.
A nobler heart and a finer
nature I never saw. There is the
simplicity of a child, the honor of
a true-born gentleman, the delicacy
of a woman, the courage of a hero,
and the piety of a saint.</q>
</p>

<p>
The tears stood in my eyes; and
taking dear Frank's hand in mine,
I said, <q>Thank you, dear old fellow,
for saying that. And, thank God,
you too have drawn a prize!</q>

<head>IV. Immortality Of Matter.</head>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> And now, doctor, what
other argument do you allege
against creation?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> The immortality of
matter, and the immortality of
force.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> The immortality of
matter?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Yes, sir. <q>Matter is
immortal, indestructible. There is
not an atom in the universe which
can be lost. We cannot, even in
thought, remove or add an atom
without admitting that the world
would thereby be disturbed, and
the laws of gravitation and the
equilibrium of matter interfered
with. It is the great merit of modern
chemistry to have proved in
the most convincing manner that
the uninterrupted changes of matter
which we daily witness, the
origin and decay of organic and
inorganic forms and tissues, do not
arise, as was hitherto believed, from
new materials, but that this change
consists in nothing else but the
constant and continuous metamorphosis
of the same elementary
principles, the quantity and quality
of which ever are, and ever remain,
the same</q> (p. 9). <q>The atoms
are in themselves unchangeable and
indestructible; to-day in this, tomorrow
in another form, they present
by the variety of their combinations
the innumerable forms in
which matter appears to our senses.
The number of atoms in any element
remains, on the whole, the
same; not a single particle is formed
anew; nor can it, when formed,
disappear from existence</q> (p. 11).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Do you say in the same
breath that no particle of matter
can be formed anew, and that,
<emph>when formed</emph>, it cannot disappear?
When is it formed, if it cannot be
formed at all?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> The phrase may be
incorrect, but the idea is sound,
and the argument conclusive.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Poor doctor! the idea
is as inconsistent as the phrase is
incorrect; and the argument is not
worthy of the name. Let us admit
that matter, elements, and atoms
have been observed to remain always
and everywhere the same.
Does it follow that matter, elements,
and atoms are indestructible?
By no means; it only follows
that, be they destructible or
<pb n='638'/><anchor id='Pg638'/>
not, they have not been actually
destroyed. You say that by the
destruction or addition of an atom
<q>the world would be disturbed.</q>
Let it be disturbed; what then?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Then the laws of
gravitation and the equilibrium of
matter would be interfered with;
which cannot be admitted. The
laws of nature are unchangeable.
What has been constantly true for
the past must be true for ever.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> You are utterly mistaken,
doctor. The world may be
disturbed by the creation or the
annihilation of matter without the
laws of nature being interfered
with. I admit that the laws of nature
are unchangeable; they have
been true for the past, and they
will be true for ever. But what is
the object of these laws? Nothing
but the mode of production of the
phenomena of the material world.
Hence you have a law of gravitation,
a law of propagation of sound,
a law of impact, a law of reflection
and of refraction, and generally
laws of motion, but you have no
law of <emph>existence</emph> and no law of <emph>substance</emph>.
Whence it is clear that all
your laws of nature would remain
exactly the same whether any new
portion of matter were brought into
being or any portion of existing
matter annihilated. Suppose that
your own body were annihilated;
would any law of nature be upset?
Would the sun cease to illuminate
the earth? Would the earth cease
to revolve round its axis or to
attract bodies? Would the ocean
cease rolling its waves to the shore?
Would fire cease to burn? In one
word, would any law of statics or
of dynamics cease to be true?
</p>

<p>
Nor can you decline this supposition
by saying that annihilation
itself would be against the laws of
nature. For all your laws of nature,
as I have just remarked, regard
the movements, and not the
substance, of the material world.
Your laws suppose the existence
of matter in the same manner as
civil laws suppose the existence of
civil society; and as these latter
are not modified by an increase or
a decrease in the number of the individuals
subject to them, so neither
would the former be modified
by any increase or decrease in
the number of material elements.
There would be, of course, a
change in the phenomena themselves,
because the execution of the
laws would be carried on suitably
to the new condition of the case;
but the laws would remain the
same. Consequently any amount
of matter could be annihilated
without the least change in the
laws of nature. Let the moon be
annihilated; the ebb and flow of
the ocean will be altered, but the
laws of motion will remain the
same; for the ebbing and flowing
of the waters will still be proportional
to the action of the disturbing
causes. Let a stone be annihilated
in the act of its falling
to the ground; the law of attraction
will remain unaltered, as it
will still be true that every falling
body must acquire, under gravitation,
a uniformly increasing velocity.
Hence the unchangeableness
of natural laws cannot be alleged
as a proof of the indestructibility
of matter; and your argument is
worthless. The utmost you can be
allowed to assume is that matter,
whether destructible or not, has
hitherto continued to exist, and
no particle of it has ever been annihilated.
</p>

<p>
This last assertion, however, is
admitted by natural philosophers,
not because there is any scientific
proof of it, but simply because
<pb n='639'/><anchor id='Pg639'/>
science has no grounds for denying
it. Science has no means of
ascertaining, for instance, whether
any remote star has been annihilated,
or any new star created, in
the last thousand years; and if
the common belief is that no new
matter has been created, and no
portion of matter annihilated, we
owe it, not to science, but to the
teaching of the Bible, which represents
the work of creation as long
ago completed, and the conservation
of all created substances as
the effect of design. But you, who
laugh at revelation, and pretend to
substantiate all your assertions by
facts, have no right to assume that
no matter has ever been annihilated.
Hence not only are you unable
to show that matter is indestructible,
but you cannot even
maintain that no particle of matter
has ever been destroyed.
</p>

<p>
But I will no longer insist on
this point. I admit that no atom
of matter can ever be lost to the
world <emph>by natural processes</emph>. My reason
is that the natural actions of
bodies, whether physical or chemical,
tend merely to the production,
modification, or neutralization of
movement, and that no amount of
change in the movement of an
atom can cause the atom to vanish.
This is not, however, a discovery
of modern chemistry, as you seem
to believe. The scholastic philosophers
had not the fortune to
know modern chemistry; yet they
never believed that new compounds
were made of new materials, though
you recklessly assert that <q>it was
hitherto believed</q>; but they always
uniformly taught that matter
was ingenerable and incorruptible.
There was therefore scarcely any
need of modern chemistry to teach
us that no portion of matter can
be lost by natural processes. Yet
this is not the real question. What
we want to know is whether an
atom, or any number of atoms, has
a necessary existence and cannot
be annihilated by God. This is
your assumption; and this is what
you are unable to show. Your argument
is, in fact, nothing but a
vicious circle. You say: <q>There
is no God; and therefore matter
cannot be annihilated</q>; and at the
same time you say: <q>Matter cannot
be annihilated; and therefore
there is no God.</q> This is, in reality,
the covert drift of your argumentation,
when from the assumed
indestructibility of matter you conclude,
first, that matter could not
have been created, and, further,
that the existence of a Creator is
a gratuitous hypothesis. On the
other hand, you cannot make good
your assertion that matter is indestructible
without first denying the
existence of a Creator. Such is
your nice logic in what you probably
consider to be one of your
best arguments.
</p>

<p>
And let me here make a passing
remark on the word <q>immortality,</q>
which you have chosen to designate
the pretended indestructibility
of matter. Immortality is not simply
<q>existence without end,</q> but <q>life
without end.</q> Hence living beings
alone can be immortal. Do you
assume, then, that a grain of dust or
an atom of matter is a living being?
If you say <emph>yes</emph>, where are the facts
that will lend a support to such an
unscientific doctrine? If you say
<emph>no</emph>, then the immortality of your
matter is nothing indeed but a new
form of what you would style <q>philosophical
charlatanism.</q>
</p>

<p>
To conclude: the indestructibility
of matter is a ridiculous invention
of ignorant empiricists, who
know neither what matter is nor
what is philosophical reasoning.
<pb n='640'/><anchor id='Pg640'/>
They make, indeed, a great deal of
noise with their scientific publications;
but their ephemeral celebrity
is due to an organized system
of mutual laudation and to Masonic
support, as you know. Let only
twenty years pass, and you may be
sure that our children will laugh at
your celebrities: and if your <hi rend='italic'>Force
and Matter</hi> is to reach them, they
will laugh at you too. Common
sense cannot slumber for ever;
and when it awakes, then will all
your infidel scribes be pronounced
designing knaves.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> I thought you would
never end, sir; but, long as your
answer has been, it has failed to
convince me. The force of my argument
lies in this: that what can
have an end must have had a beginning.
If, therefore, matter is
not indestructible, it must have had
a beginning.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Certainly.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> But a beginning of
matter is inconceivable. For how
could matter come into existence?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> By creation out of nothing.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> This is what I deny.
For out of nothing nothing can
arise. This is an axiom. Hence
<q>never can an atom arise anew or
disappear; it can only change its
combinations.... Matter must
have existed from eternity, and
must last for ever</q> (p. 12).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I am not in the least
surprised to hear that my long talk
did not convince you. It is always
difficult to convince a man against
his will. My object, however, was
not to give you a positive demonstration
of the fact of creation, but
only to show that the reasons which
you were parading against creation
amount to nothing. Of this I hope
I have not failed to convince you.
But now you come forward with a
new argument, which indeed is very
old, consisting in a pretended axiom,
that out of nothing nothing can
arise. Suppose, doctor, that I deny
your axiom. How would you show
that I deny a truth?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>How can any one
deny the axiom that out of nothing
nothing can arise?</q> (p. 12).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> You must know, doctor,
that what you assume to be an
old axiom is only an old error. In
fact, why do you say that out of nothing
nothing can arise? Simply
because natural energies can do nothing
without pre-existing materials.
Hence your argument amounts to
this. <q>Natural energies never make
anything out of nothing; therefore
out of nothing nothing can be
made.</q> That this conclusion is a
great blunder I need not prove, I
presume, as logic teaches that no
conclusion can be more general
than its premises. Where is, then,
the ground of your pretended
axiom?
</p>

<p>
Nor can you reply that the natural
energies are the only energies known
to us, and that, if these cannot make
anything out of nothing, the axiom
is unexceptionably true. This
would be to assume what you are
bound to prove, to wit, that there is
no power above the natural forces;
and to assume this is what logicians
call <hi rend='italic'>Petitio principii</hi>. On the
other hand, you cannot maintain
that such natural forces are the
only ones we know; for you cannot
limit the range of human knowledge
within the narrow sphere of
mere empiricism without denying
human reason.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> We have no notion of
supersensible forces.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> You talk without reflection,
doctor. If you have no
such a notion, what is it, then, that
compels you to admit any demonstrated
<pb n='641'/><anchor id='Pg641'/>
truth? Is it attraction,
heat, electricity, or any of your physical
or chemical forces? No; it is
the force of demonstration, it is the
force of truth. This is no vain
theory; I appeal to your own experience.
Your intellect is obliged
to yield to the force of evidence
and demonstration just as inevitably
as the pendulum is obliged to
yield to the force of gravitation.
And since a real effect requires a
real cause, hence whatever thus
really compels your intellect to
yield must have a real power, and
that evidently supersensible.
</p>

<p>
But reverting to your pretended
axiom, I have yet to remark that,
strictly speaking, it does not even
hold in the case of natural causes;
in other terms, I say that nothing
is ever produced by natural causes
except out of nothing. Of course
no tailor ever made a coat without
cloth, and no carpenter ever built a
ship without pre-existing materials.
This I admit; but if you closely
examine the point, you will see that
to make a coat or a ship is not <emph>to
produce</emph> it, and that the action of
the tailor and the carpenter wholly
consists in modifying and arranging
the materials so as to give them a
form. It is, therefore, this <emph>form</emph>
alone that is produced. Now,
clearly, this form, before its production,
was nothing; for it had no existence.
And therefore the work
of the tailor or the carpenter is a
production of something out of nothing.<note place='foot'>Such forms are usually said to be produced
<q>out of the potency of matter</q>; but this makes
no difference. For what is only in potency to
exist is still nothing: hence what is to be drawn
out of the potency of matter is still nothing. Its
production, however, is not a creation, because
it implies a real subject.</note>
And thus either you must
deny that anything is ever produced,
or you must give up your axiom
that nothing can be produced out
of nothing.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> I cannot give up my
axiom without inconsistency. I
will rather deny that anything is
ever really produced. In fact,
<q>Those are children, or persons
with a narrow sphere of vision, says
Empedocles, who imagine that anything
arises that has not existed before,
or that anything can entirely
die and perish</q> (p. 15).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> These are empty
words.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> On the other hand,
<q>the immortality of matter is now
a fact scientifically established, and
can no longer be denied</q> (p. 13).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Indeed?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Yes; <q>Its actual proof
is given by our scales and retorts</q>
(p. 13).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I thought I had already
shown that your scales and retorts
are incapable of giving such a
proof.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>Sebastian Frank, a
German who lived in 1528, says:
Matter was in the beginning in
God, and is on that account eternal
and infinite. The earth and
everything created may pass away,
but we cannot say that that will
perish out of which matter is created.
The substance remains for
ever</q> (p. 14).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Do you endorse these
words?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Certainly.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Then you catch yourself
in your own trap. For if matter
is created, as your German
writer says, surely there is a Creator.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> But if matter was in
the beginning in God, and was
eternal, it is plain that matter could
not be created.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Perfectly true. And
therefore, since matter, according
to your German authority, has been
created, surely matter was not in
<pb n='642'/><anchor id='Pg642'/>
the beginning in God. But, after
all, can you endorse Frank's words
without admitting a God? And
can you admit a God and a Creator
while fighting against creation
and the existence of God? Be
honest, doctor, and confess that bad
indeed must a cause be which cannot
be maintained but by clumsy
sophistry and shameful contradiction.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>V. Immortality Of Force.</head>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> In your theory, doctor,
force is immortal. This I cannot
understand. Would you tell me
how you come to such a conclusion?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>Indestructible, imperishable,
and immortal as matter is
also its immanent force. Intimately
united to matter, force revolves
in the same never-ending cycle, and
emerges from any form in the same
quantity as it entered. If it be an
undoubted fact that matter can
neither be produced nor destroyed,
but merely transformed, then it must
also be assumed as an established
principle that there is not a single
case in which force can be produced
out of, or pass into, nothing; or, in
other words, can be born or annihilated.
In all cases where force is
manifested it may be reduced to
its sources; that is to say, it can be
ascertained from what other forces
a definite amount of force has been
obtained, either directly or by conversion.
This convertibility is not
arbitrary, but takes place according
to definite equivalents, so that not
the smallest quantity of force can
be lost</q> (p. 16).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> How do you account
for this theory?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>Logic and our daily
experience teach us that no natural
motion or change, consequently no
manifestation of force, can take
place without producing an endless
chain of successive motions and
changes, as every effect becomes
immediately the cause of succeeding
effects. There is no repose
of any kind in nature; its
whole existence is a constant cycle,
in which every motion, the consequence
of a preceding motion, becomes
immediately the cause of an
equivalent succeeding one; so that
there is nowhere a gap, nowhere
either loss or gain. No motion in
nature proceeds from or passes into
nothing; and as in the material
world every individual form can
only realize its existence by drawing
its materials from the immense
storehouse of matter, so does every
motion originate from the equally
immense storehouse of forces, to
which sooner or later the borrowed
quantity of force is again returned.
The motion may become latent&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>,
apparently concealed; but nevertheless
it is not lost, having merely
been converted into equivalent
states, from which it will escape
again in some shape. During this
process force has changed its mode;
for force may, though essentially
the same, assume in the universe
a variety of modes. The various
forms may, as already stated, be
converted into others without loss,
so that the sum-total of existing forces
can neither be increased nor
diminished, the forms only changing</q>
(pp. 17, 18).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> What do you mean by
<q>forms of forces</q>?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Physics, as I stated to
you on another occasion, <q>makes
us acquainted with eight different
forces&mdash;gravitation, mechanical
force, heat, light, electricity, magnetism,
affinity, cohesion, which,
inseparably united to matter, form
and give shape to the world. These
<pb n='643'/><anchor id='Pg643'/>
forces are, with few exceptions, mutually
convertible, so that nothing
is lost in the process of conversion</q>
(p. 18).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> <q>With few exceptions</q>?
I fear that any exception will prove
fatal to your theory. But go on,
doctor; I wish to hear more about
your conversion of forces.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>We may cite a few
instances of transformation or convertibility
of forces. Heat and
light are produced by combustion.
Heat again is converted into mechanical
power in steam, and mechanical
force can again by friction
be reconverted into heat, and, as in
the electro-magnetical machine, into
heat, electricity, magnetism, and
light. One of the most frequent
conversions of force is that of heat
into mechanical force, and <foreign rend='italic'>vice
versa</foreign></q> (pp. 18, 19).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> What conclusion do you
draw from these and similar facts?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> I draw the conclusion
that in speaking of forces <q>the word
<hi rend='italic'>lost</hi> is an incorrect expression; for
in all these and similar cases there
is not a minim of power lost as regards
the universe, but merely as
regards the immediate object. The
expended force has in reality only
assumed different forms, the sum-total
of which is equivalent to the
original force. Innumerable examples
may be adduced to establish
this law, which is expressed in
the axiom that <hi rend='italic'>force can neither be
created nor destroyed</hi>&mdash;an axiom from
which results the immortality of
force, and the impossibility of its
having a beginning or an end. The
consequence of this recently-discovered
natural truth is the same
as that deduced from the immortality
of matter, and both form and
manifest from eternity the sum of
phenomena which we term <hi rend='italic'>world</hi>.
The cycle of matter sides, as a necessary
correlate, with the cycle of
force, and teaches that nothing is
generated anew, that nothing disappears,
and that the secret of nature
lies in an eternal and immanent
cycle, in which cause and effect
are connected without beginning
or end. That only can be immortal
which has existed from
eternity; and what is immortal cannot
have been created</q> (pp. 21, 22).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I have heard with great
attention all you have said, doctor,
and I am sorry to see that you are
as wrong as ever. Your argument
is altogether ludicrous.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> It is, however, a mere
statement of known facts.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I question this very
much. But even if the alleged facts
were unquestionable, and could
not receive any other interpretation
than that which you give of them,
your conclusion about the <q>immortality
of force</q> would still be
groundless. In fact, the forces of
which you speak are all material,
and have their existence in matter
alone. It is therefore vain and
preposterous to argue about the
immortality of such forces when
you have already failed to show the
immortality of matter itself. You
boast that your argument is a mere
statement of facts; and so do all
modern sciolists, more or less awkwardly,
when pushed to the wall.
But what are the facts? Is heat a
form of force? Is it a form convertible
into another form? I perceive
from your style that you
never studied this subject; you
only repeat like a parrot what other
parrots have learned to say, without
the least notion of the true state
of things. Tell me, what is a form
of force? What is force itself?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> It is not my duty to
define force. I accept the definition
of the physicists.
</p>

<pb n='644'/><anchor id='Pg644'/>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> This is exactly what I
expected to hear. Yet when a
man undertakes to philosophize on
anything, he ought to know very
distinctly what that thing is. Do
you make any difference between
<q>forces</q> and <q>powers</q>?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> No, sir, as is evident
from my terminology.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Do you discriminate between
<q>force</q> and <q>quantity of
action</q>?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> No, sir.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Do you identify <q>force</q>
with <q>quantity of movement</q>?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Then it is evident that
you confound force, power, quantity
of action, and quantity of movement.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> All these terms are
substantially identical in science.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> True, the lowest school
of physicists considers them as substantially
identical, and in this
manner they succeed in persuading
themselves and many others that
the quantity of living force existing
in the world is always invariably
the same. But, after all, those physicists
speak very incorrectly, and
are not to be followed in their
blundering terminology. A quantity
of movement is not an action,
but the result of action; and a
quantity of action is not a power,
but the exertion of power. In fact,
the same power acts with different
intensity in different conditions;
and equal actions produce different
movements in bodies actually subject
to different dynamical determinations.
Hence it is impossible
to admit that powers, actions, and
movements are synonymous.
</p>

<p>
And now, which of these three
notions do you choose to identify
with force? If you say that force
is <q>a quantity of movement,</q> then
it will be false that no force is ever
lost; for any quantity of movement
can be lost <emph>without compensation</emph>.
Thus a stone thrown up vertically
loses its quantity of movement
without compensation.<note place='foot'>This has been shown in <hi rend='smallcaps'>The Catholic World</hi>
for March, 1874, pp. 764, 765.</note> If you
say that force is <q>a quantity of action,</q>
it will again be false that no
force is ever lost; for all successive
actions successively pass away, and
continually change their direction
and their intensity, according as
the distances and positions of the
bodies acted on are altered. Lastly,
if you say that force is <q>power,</q>
then it is false that forces are transformed
or convertible; for the
power of each element of matter
remains unalterably the same, as
you yourself acknowledge, throughout
all the vicissitudes of time.
<q>A particle of iron,</q> you say with
Dubois-Reymond, <q>is and remains
the same, whether it crosses the
horizon in the meteoric stone,
rushes along in the wheel of the
steam-engine, or circulates in the
blood through the temples of the
poet.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Would you, then, repudiate
science?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> By no means. I love
and respect true science. I only
repudiate that false and presumptuous
dogmatism which prompts a
class of physicists to draw general
conclusions from particular, and
often questionable, premises.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Do you, then, condemn
the method of induction?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Not at all. I condemn
the abuse of that method. What
right have modern scientists of extending
the principle of the <q>conservation
of force</q> beyond the
boundaries marked by observation
and experiment? All they have a
right to say is that <hi rend='italic'>in the impact of
bodies an equal quantity of movement
<pb n='645'/><anchor id='Pg645'/>
is lost by one body and acquired by
another</hi>. This is the fact. But
does it follow that therefore the
movement lost by the one body
passes <emph>identically</emph> into the other?
This is what they imagine; and
this is what cannot be proved, because
it is absurd. Movement is
an affection of matter, and has no
independent existence, as you well
know. It cannot, therefore, pass
identically from body to body any
more than a movement of anger can
pass identically from man to man.
And yet it is on this absurd notion
of <emph>nomadic</emph> movement that the whole
theory of the conservation of force,
as now held by your advanced
thinkers, has been raised. They
say: <q>The quantity of movement
which is lost by one of the bodies,
and that which is acquired by the
other, are perfectly equal; therefore
a quantity of movement passes identically
from one body to another.</q>
In other terms they say: <q>There
is equality; therefore there is identity.</q>
Is this legitimate induction?
Good logic would lead us to argue
in the following manner: The actions
of the two struggling bodies,
being equal and opposite, must
produce equal and opposite quantities
of movement; hence the
quantity of movement which is <emph>destroyed</emph>
in the impinging body must
equal the quantity of movement
<emph>produced</emph> in the body impinged upon.
Such is the only logical view
of the subject; it agrees both with
reason and with fact, and it strikes
your theory at the root. For what
is destroyed is no more; and what
is produced had no existence before
its production.
</p>

<p>
We might allow you to talk of the
<q>conservation</q> and <q>conversion</q>
of forces, were you reasonable
enough to consider such expressions
as mere conventional technicalities
suited to explain the relations
of effects to effects rather than
of effects to causes. But you construe
the technical phrases into
real and absolute principles, and
try to explain causation by substituting
the effect for the cause;
which is as ridiculous an abuse of the
word <q>force</q> as if a carpenter pretended
that his iron square is the
square spoken of in the treatises of
geometry. But this is not all.
What right have you to apply such
a theory, whether right or wrong, to
gravitation?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>The pendulum of
every clock shows the conversion
of gravitation into motion</q> (p. 21).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Indeed? What do you
mean by gravitation? The attractive
power of the earth, or its action,
or the weight of the pendulum?
Surely the attractive power of
the earth is not converted into movement;
for it remains in the earth, and
it continues its work. Neither is the
weight of the pendulum converted
into movement; for the pendulum
does not cease, while moving, to
have weight, nor does it weigh more
when, at rest; and at the end of its oscillation
is not found to have expended
or consumed any portion of its
weight. You are therefore obliged
to say that it is the action of the earth
that is converted into movement.
But such an expression can have
no meaning; because the action is
the production of an act, and it is
the act itself, not its production,
that constitutes the formal principle
of the movement. On the
other hand, a production which
becomes the thing produced is
such an absurdity that not even a
lunatic could dream of it. Thus it
is quite evident that in no imaginable
sense can gravitation be considered
as <emph>converted</emph> into movement.
It produces movement, but is not
<pb n='646'/><anchor id='Pg646'/>
converted into it. You see, doctor,
that your so boasted theory has no
foundation either in reason or in
fact.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> But we cannot deny
that mechanical movement is convertible
into heat, that heat may
become light, and that all other
such forces can be transformed.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I repeat, and, on the
strength of the reasons which I
have brought forward, I maintain
that the term <q>conversion of
forces</q> may be admitted as a conventional
phrase, but not as exhibiting
a philosophical notion. A
real conversion of mechanical
movement into heat would require
that a movement of translation
should be transformed into a movement
of vibration by being distributed
among the molecules of the
body which is heated. This I have
already shown to be impossible.
Things follow a different course.
When the hammer falls upon the
anvil, its action (and not its movement)
shakes the first range of
molecules which it encounters.
These molecules are thus constrained
to approach the following set of
molecules lying immediately under
them, and to trouble their relative
equilibrium. These latter, in their
turn, trouble the equilibrium of the
following set, and so on till all the
molecules of the anvil partake in the
movement, each molecule undergoing
alternate <hi rend='italic'>compression</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>dilatation</hi>,
the first through the violent action
of its neighbors, and the second
by the reaction due to its immanent
powers. The consequence of all this
is that a rapid succession of vibratory
movements is originated in
each molecule; and thus, as soon
as the movement of translation of
the falling hammer is extinguished,
the movement of vibration is awakened
in the molecules of both the
anvil and the hammer. Now, what
is this but a case of impact? For
just as the hammer impinges on
the surface of the anvil does each
molecule of the anvil impinge on
its neighbor; and therefore what
you call a transformation of mechanical
into vibratory movement
is not a real transformation of the
one into the other, but the extinction
of the one and the production
of the other. Thus heat is generated
by percussion; and in a similar
manner it would be generated by
friction and by other mechanical
processes. Whenever heat is produced,
molecules are set into vibrations
of a certain intensity, and
their relative equilibrium disturbed.
Evidently, such a disturbance of the
molecular equilibrium is due to interaction
of molecules&mdash;that is, to
molecular impact. Now, I have
already shown, and you have understood
it, I hope, that, in the case
of impact, the movement never
passes identically from this matter
to that, but is produced in the one
at the same rate as it is extinguished
in the other.
</p>

<p>
I might say a great deal more on
this subject, but here I stop, as I
almost regret having said so much.
Your theory of the conservation of
force does not bear out your <q>immortality
of force,</q> and is so destitute
of proof that it does not deserve
the honor of a longer refutation.<note place='foot'>We are not unfrequently imposed upon by
the infidel phraseology and the bold assertions
of modern scientists. We should remember that
bold assertions in science may be as false as
they are bold. The theory of the indestructibility
of force is one of such assertions; and yet it
is trumpeted about as a demonstrated truth. It
is time for us to awake. The seed of atheism is
sown everywhere under cover of positive science;
but the fraud may be easily detected. Infidel
theories are usually mere trash; and if we
were to look into them a little more sharply, we
would find that they bear no examination. It is
the duty of our Catholic professors of physics
and mechanics to raise their voices in earnest,
and expose the fraud instead of gobbling it
down. We have only pointed out some of the
reasons why the new mechanical theory must be
rejected; but its pretensions may be more effectually
crushed by thorough scientific and mathematical
analysis, as pure philosophical arguments
are unfortunately above the comprehension
of most modern students.</note>

<div>
<head>VI. Infinity Of Matter.</head>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> How do you account,
doctor, for your assertion that
<q>matter is infinite</q>?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> In a very simple manner:
<q>Whether we investigate the
extension of matter in its magnitude
or minuteness, we never come
to an end or to an ultimate form of
it. When the invention of the microscope
disclosed unknown worlds,
and exhibited to the eye of the investigator
the infinite minuteness
of organic elements, the hope was
raised that we might discover the
ultimate organic atom, perhaps the
mode of its origin. This hope
vanished with the improvement of
our instruments. The microscope
showed that in the hundredth part
of a drop of water there existed a
world of animalcules, of the most
delicate and definite forms, which
move and digest like other animals,
and are endowed with organs, the
structure of which we have little
conception of</q> (p. 23). <q>We
term the most minute particle of
matter, which we imagine to be no
longer capable of division, an <hi rend='italic'>atom</hi>,
and consider matter to be composed
of such atoms, acquiring from
them its qualities, and existing by
their reciprocal attraction and repulsion.
But the word <hi rend='italic'>atom</hi> is
merely an expression for a necessary
conception, required for certain
purposes. We have no real notion
of the thing we term <hi rend='italic'>atom</hi>; we
know nothing of its size, form, composition,
etc. No one has seen it.
The speculative philosophers deny
its existence, as they do not admit
that a thing can exist which is no
longer divisible. Thus neither observation
nor thought leads us, in
regard to the minuteness of matter,
to a point where we can stop; nor
have we any hope that we shall
ever reach that point</q> (p. 24, 25).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> That point has been
reached, doctor. The theory of
primitive, unextended elements is
well known and advocated by good
scientists and thoughtful philosophers.
But let this pass, as I long
for your demonstration of the infinity
of matter.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>Like the microscope
in respect to the minuteness, so
does the telescope conduct us to
the universe at large. Astronomers
boldly thought to penetrate into the
inmost recesses of the world; but
the more their instruments were
improved, the more worlds expanded
before their astonished eyes.
The telescope resolved the whitish
nebulæ in the sky into myriads of
stars, worlds, solar and planetary
systems; and the earth with its inhabitants,
hitherto imagined to be
the crown and centre of existence,
was degraded from its imaginary
height to be a mere atom moving
in universal space. The distances
of the celestial bodies are so immense
that our intellect wonders
at the contemplation of them, and
becomes confused. Light, moving
with a velocity of millions of miles
in a minute, required no less than
two thousand years to reach the
earth from the galaxy! And the
large telescope of Lord Rosse has
disclosed stars so distant from us
that their light must have travelled
thirty millions of years before it
reached the earth. But a simple
observation must convince us that
these stars are not at the limit of
space. All bodies obey the law of
<pb n='648'/><anchor id='Pg648'/>
gravitation, and attract each other.
In assuming, now, a limitation, the
attraction must tend towards an
imagined centre of gravity, and the
consequence would be the conglomeration
of all matter in one celestial
body. However great the
distances may be, such an union
must happen; but as it does not
happen, although the world exists
from eternity, there can be no attraction
towards a common centre.
And this gravitation towards a
centre can only be prevented by
there being, beyond the bodies visible
to us, others still further which
attract from without&mdash;and so forth
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ad infinitum</foreign>. Every imagined limitation
would render the existence
of the world impossible</q> (pp. 25,
26).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Is this the whole of your
argument?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I should like to know
how could the large telescope of
Lord Rosse disclose stars so distant
from us that their light must have
travelled thirty millions of years
before it reached the earth? Do you
not know that in thirty millions of
years light travels two million millions
of times over the distance from
the earth to the sun? And do you
hope the world will believe that,
thanks to Lord Rosse's telescope, it
has been possible to determine the
parallax of a star two million millions
of times more distant from us
than we are from the sun? The
world indeed is ignorant and credulous;
but when the lie is too impudent,
it is apt to cry you down
as a charlatan. You are most imprudent,
doctor. You had no need
of Lord Rosse's telescope for your
argumentation; and your mention
of the distant stars disclosed by it
was therefore an inexcusable blunder.
But the argument itself has
no foundation. You imagine that,
if the world were not infinitely expanded
in all directions, all matter,
by universal gravitation, would have
conglomerated into one celestial
body. But tell me, Does the moon
gravitate towards the earth?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Of course it does.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> How do you account,
then, for the fact that the moon has
not fallen, nor is likely to fall, on
the earth? Is it because the moon
is attracted by some matter lying
outside its orbit?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> It is on account of
centrifugal force accompanying its
curvilinear motion.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I am delighted to see
that you can explain the fact without
appealing to the infinity of
matter. Let us go on. As the
moon gravitates towards the earth,
so do all satellites towards their
planets, and all planets towards the
sun. And yet none of the satellites
have fallen into their planets, and
none of the planets into the sun.
Is this owing to the matter which
lies outside of the planetary and
solar system? I presume, doctor,
that the enormous distance of fixed
stars from us will not encourage
you to believe that their attraction
on any planet can cope with its
gravitation towards the sun. On
the other hand, this gravitation is
not neutralized by the action of
any exterior matter; for all planets
actually obey the solar attraction,
as their orbital movement conclusively
shows. This same orbital
movement implies also a centrifugal
tendency; and this tendency
sufficiently prevents the falling of
the planets on the sun. This is
unquestionable doctrine.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> I admit the doctrine.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Accordingly it is evident
there is no need of infinite
matter to prevent the celestial
<pb n='649'/><anchor id='Pg649'/>
bodies from clustering into one
central body. Centrifugal forces,
in fact, are sufficient, even by your
own admission, to remove all danger
of such a catastrophe; and
centrifugal forces are to be found
wherever there is curvilinear movement
around a centre of attraction,
that is, throughout all the world,
according to astronomical induction.
Consequently your argument
in favor of the infinity of matter
is a mere delusion.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>If we can find no
limit to minuteness, and are still
less able to reach it in respect to
magnitude, we must declare matter
to be infinite in either direction,
and incapable of limitation in time
or space. If the laws of thought
demonstrate an infinite divisibility
of matter, and if it be further impossible
to imagine a limited space
or a nothing, it must be admitted
that there is here a remarkable concordance
of logical laws with the
results of our scientific investigations</q>
(p. 27).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Your great scientific investigations
give no result that favors
the infinity of matter. This
we have just seen. Logical laws
give no better results. It is idle,
doctor, to assume that there is any
law of thought which demonstrates
the infinite divisibility of matter;
and it is as capricious to assert the
impossibility of imagining that the
space occupied by matter is limited.
You say that outside that
space there would be nothing, and
therefore there would be no space
except that occupied by matter;
whence you conclude that space
would be limited. Do not fear,
doctor, for the fate of space. Outside
the space which is occupied
by matter there is yet infinite
space unoccupied by matter. Space
is not made up of matter. Move
the matter; you will not move
space. Remove all matter; space
will not disappear. Of course you
cannot understand this, because
whoever blots God out of the world
extinguishes the source of his intellectual
light, and is therefore
doomed to grope for ever in the
dark. But we Christian philosophers,
who admit a God infinite
and immense, have no great difficulty
to understand how there can
be space not occupied by matter.
Wherever God is, there is space
which can be occupied by matter;
for wherever God is, there he can
create any amount of matter; and
wherever matter can be placed,
there is space; for space is nothing
but the possibility of locating matter.
</p>

<p>
It is not my intention to dilate
on this topic, nor is it necessary.
To answer your difficulty I need
only say that space, though void of
matter, is always full of God's substance,
to whose immensity alone
we must resort, if we desire to account
at all for the existence of infinite
space.

<div>
<head>VII. Dignity Of Matter.</head>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I scarcely expected,
doctor, that you would devote a
chapter of your book to such a trifling
and unscientific subject as the
dignity of matter. Is not matter,
as such, the lowest of all known
substances? What is the dignity
of matter?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> You belong to the old
school, sir. I will tell you what is
the modern view of matter: <q>To despise
matter and our own body because
it is material, to consider nature
and the world as dust which we
must endeavor to shake off, nay, to
torment our own body, can only arise
<pb n='650'/><anchor id='Pg650'/>
from a confusion of notions, the result
of ignorance and fanaticism</q>
(p. 28).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> You begin with a false
assumption, doctor. We of the old
school do not despise the body
<q>because it is material.</q> God created
matter; and whatever proceeds
from God is very good. We,
however, consider the body as of a
lower nature than our rational soul,
and try to put a check to its unruly
appetites&mdash;a thing which you,
being a physician, will surely approve
and commend as conducive
to the preservation of health, not to
say of morality.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>Matter is not inferior
to, but the peer of, spirit; the one
cannot exist without the other;
and matter is the vehicle of all
mental power, of all human and
earthly greatness</q> (p. 28).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> This is, doctor, the most
abject and degrading materialism.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> I am not afraid of this
word, sir. <q>We frequently hear
those persons contemptuously called
<hi rend='italic'>materialists</hi> who do not share the
fashionable contempt for matter,
but endeavor to fathom by its means
the powers and laws of existence;
who have discerned that spirit
could not have built the world out
of itself, and that it is impossible to
arrive at a just conception of the
world without an exact knowledge
of matter and its laws. In this
sense the name of materialist can
nowadays be only a title of
honor. It is to materialists that
we owe the conquest over matter
and a knowledge of its laws, so
that, almost released from the
chains of gravitation, we fly with
the swiftness of the wind across the
plain, and are enabled to communicate,
with the celerity of thought,
with the most distant parts of the
globe. Malevolence is silenced by
such facts; and the times are past
in which a world produced by a
deceitful fancy was considered of
more value than the reality</q> (p.
29).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> You commit blunders
upon blunders, doctor. We do not
call materialists those who do not
share <q>the fashionable contempt for
matter,</q> but those who deny the
existence of a spiritual soul, or
teach that matter is not inferior to,
but the peer of, spirit, and that the
one cannot exist without the other,
just as you teach. And therefore
your definition of materialism is
your first blunder. Again, contempt
for matter is not, and never
has been, <q>fashionable</q>; second
blunder. That materialists endeavor
<q>to fathom the powers and
laws of existence</q> is a third blunder;
for they are not even capable
of fathoming their own ignorance,
as our present discussion shows
very clearly. A further blunder is
to speak of <q>the powers and laws
of existence,</q> as if there were any
law of existence. A fifth blunder
is to give credit to the materialists
for having discerned <q>that spirit
could not have built the world <hi rend='italic'>out
of itself</hi>.</q> This was discerned long
ago by Christian philosophers;
whereas your materialists have
even failed to discern that spirit
could create the world <hi rend='italic'>out of nothing</hi>.
A sixth blunder is contained
in your assertion that <q>it is to
materialists that we owe the conquest
over matter and a knowledge
of its laws.</q> Indeed, you might as
well say that we owe light to darkness,
and wisdom to dolts. Go
and study, O great doctor and president
of the medical association of
Hessen-Darmstadt! and then tell
us whether Newton, Volta, Galileo,
Galvani, Biot, Ampère, Cuvier,
<pb n='651'/><anchor id='Pg651'/>
Faraday, Liebig, and scores of
other great scientists were materialists.
To such men we owe modern
science; but what does science owe
to your materialists? What law
did they discover? What conquests
have they achieved? It is absurd
for them to complain of <q>malevolence</q>
when they are treated with
the contempt they deserve. They
are, in fact, mere plunderers and
traitors of science.
</p>

<p>
But I wonder, doctor, whether
your love of materialism is much
calculated to show the <emph>dignity</emph> of
matter. You have not adduced as
yet any reason why we should think
of matter very highly. You have
said, indeed, that matter is <q>the peer
of spirit</q>; but this is mere twaddle,
as you admit of no other spirit than
what would be a result of material
combination. I want something
better&mdash;something like a good argument&mdash;before
I can appreciate the
dignity of matter.

</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Bosh.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>He further states that
injured nature avenged itself, and
that rebellion, the use of poison and
the dagger against superiors, were
by no means rare in these living
tombs</q> (p. 30).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> And you believe such
lies? Of course there is no reason
why they should not be circulated
among the ignorant and superstitious.
They are fond of believing
such things, and they are served
according to their taste. The supply
always meets the demand. Oh!
how truly right was S. Paul when
he said that <hi rend='italic'>those who turn a deaf
ear to truth are doomed to swallow
fables</hi>! Those who do not believe
the Catholic Church, the highest
authority on earth, by just judgment
stupidly believe the lies of a
Rostan and of a hundred other
charlatans of modern times. But
let us not forget the real point at
issue. Your object was to show
the dignity of matter. Where are
your proofs? Do you think that
the dignity of matter can be established
by defamation? Every intelligent
reader will infer, on the
contrary, that it is from lack of
reasons that you are obliged to disgrace
your work with libel and
slander.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> I am not a forger,
after all. I have cited my authorities.
But the dignity of matter
appears from the fact that it is to
matter that we owe science. <q>Have
those who start from God and not
from matter ever given us any clue
as to the quality of matter and its
laws, after which they say the world
is governed? Could they tell us
whether the sun moves or is at rest?
whether the earth is a globe or a
plain? what was God's design?
No! That would be an impossibility.
To start from God in the
investigation of nature is a phrase
without meaning. The unfortunate
tendency to proceed in the investigation
of nature from theoretical
premises, and to construe the world
and natural truths by way of speculation,
is long abandoned; and it is
by pursuing an opposite course of
scientific investigation that the great
advance of our knowledge of nature
in recent times must be ascribed</q>
(pp. 31, 32).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> It is evident that all
our knowledge begins in sensible
representations, and therefore depends
on matter. But how can you
infer from this the dignity of matter?
When you ascend a ladder,
the first step is always the lowest;
which shows the contrary of what
you wish to prove. Matter is the
lowest of all objects of knowledge,
while the highest is God. From
matter we start, and in God we
must end. This every one admits;
you, however, assume that some
philosophers <q>start from God, and
not from matter.</q> Who are they?
Are they, forsooth, those who teach
that matter has been created by
God? Then you are unjust to
them, and falsify the history of science,
by giving us to understand
that they could not tell us whether
the sun moves or is at rest, and
whether the earth is a globe or a
plain. It was not the atheist or
the materialist that taught us astronomy
and geography. The materialist
can only tell us, as you do,
that <q>all natural and mental forces
are inherent in matter</q> (p. 32),
which is no science at all; and
that <q>in matter alone forces can
manifest themselves,</q> or that <q>matter
is the origin of all that exists</q>
<pb n='653'/><anchor id='Pg653'/>
(<hi rend='italic'>ibid.</hi>), which is the reverse of
science. <emph>This</emph> they can prate; but
as for the great laws of nature, they
had to learn them from us&mdash;I
mean from men who did not preach
the dignity of matter with the foolish
and ignoble purpose of dethroning
God. You condemn those who
<q>construe the world and natural
truths by way of speculation.</q>
This I have already answered; but
I may remind you that by condemning
speculation you condemn yourself.
Experimental knowledge is
very good; but it is by speculation
alone that our knowledge acquires
its scientific character. Hence
your view of science without speculation
is as absurd as your assumption
of matter without spirit and
without God. This may suit materialists,
for they stop supinely at
the lowest step of the ladder; but
intellectual men have a mind to ascend
the ladder to the very top.
What is the use of knowing matter,
if you know nothing else? Matter
is the alphabet of science; to study
matter, and to ignore the methods
of rising from matter to spirit, and
from the world to God, is to study
the alphabet alone during all your
life, and to die an abecedarian.
This is what you crave; this is what
you adorn with the venerable name
of science; whereas we believers
not only study the alphabet, but
also read the great book of the universe,
and know that the book has
an Author, whose thoughts it reveals.
You have vainly labored to
establish the dignity of matter.
Had you known how to read the
book of nature, you would have
discovered that matter has no natural
dignity but that of being the
lowest work <hi rend='italic'>of Him whose works are
all perfect</hi>.

<head>Church Music.<note place='foot'>A paper read before the <hi rend='smallcaps'>Catholic Union</hi> of
Boston, Mass., June 4, 1874.</note></head>

<div>
<head>I.</head>

<p>
From the earliest times music
has had a place in the public worship
of all peoples&mdash;among the
pagans, among the Jews, among
Christians. Its use in this connection
has been dictated by God himself
in the act of constituting the
human mind; it has, moreover, received
his express sanction, as we
learn from the ordinances of the
Jewish people. In the new law it
has even been consecrated by his
own divine example, since we read
that our Lord and his apostles
sang hymns together. His birth
was heralded to the world by the
song of his angels, and heaven is
represented to the Christian as a
place where we shall sing for ever
the praises of God.
</p>

<p>
Church music, therefore, dates
from the origin of Christianity, and
has constituted ever since an integral,
though not an essential, part
of public worship among Christians.
</p>

<p>
The church has her simple offices
and her solemn offices, and she has
made the use of music one of the
chief marks by which they are distinguished.
</p>

<p>
Church music grew with the
growth of the church. As Christians
increased and prospered, music
was more and more cultivated,
and was more largely introduced
into their solemn exercises of worship.
</p>

<p>
The extent to which sacred music
was cultivated in the early church
cannot be easily determined; we
have no reason to think it was very
great.
</p>

<p>
When Europe emerged from that
sad state of confusion which came
over it with the invasion of the
northern barbarians, and music was
revived as a science and an art, it
was, like the other branches of learning,
at first confined mostly to the
clergy, and its productions were
for a long time almost exclusively
of a sacred character.
</p>

<p>
The church being an indestructible
institution, her traditions are
handed down by one generation of
her children to another. It was
thus that in a dark day of confusion
and destruction she preserved for
us the treasures of ancient learning
and the arts; and the world to-day
owes to her not only the modern
developments of poetry, painting,
sculpture, and architecture, but also
the beautiful and varied combinations
of modern music.
</p>

<p>
At first, as we have just said,
there was no music but that which
was dedicated to holy purposes,
except such rude melodies as nature
in all ages teaches the most uncultivated.
</p>

<p>
The musical drama did not exist;
and music does not seem to have
made any essential part of the pageants
or spectacles destined for the
public entertainment.
</p>

<p>
It was from the church that music
was introduced into the chamber,
the hall, and the street, and
<pb n='655'/><anchor id='Pg655'/>
in the beginning secular music imitated
and borrowed the forms of
that which was sacred.
</p>

<p>
The music used in the sacred offices
at first and during many centuries
was the plain chant. How
much of this chant was taken from
pagan or Jewish sources cannot be
determined, for authorities differ
widely; but in any case it was so
modified and improved by the fathers
of the Eastern Church, and
afterwards in the West by SS. Ambrose
and Gregory, when they
adapted it to the purposes of Christian
worship, that it is now frequently
called the <hi rend='italic'>ecclesiastical chant</hi>,
though it is oftener called <hi rend='italic'>Gregorian</hi>,
from the pope just mentioned.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning it was what its
name indicates&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>plain</hi> and simple.
It was sung in unison, and its melodies
did not exceed the compass
of the most ordinary voices.
</p>

<p>
But unison was found monotonous,
as also the uniformity of time
or measure generally observed in
plain chant. The first departure
from the old and severe forms was
made when, about the middle of the
IXth century, they introduced a
sort of rude harmony constructed
on the chant.
</p>

<p>
But this did not satisfy the craving
for change, and the love of novelty,
once indulged, led the way to
many excesses.
</p>

<p>
Baini gives us an example of the
abuses that then became prevalent.
<q>They would write, for example,
a Mass,</q> he says, <q>taking as a subject
the melody of the Gregorian
<hi rend='italic'>Ave Maria</hi>. Three parts in the
harmony would sing portions of the
<hi rend='italic'>Kyrie</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Gloria</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>Credo</hi> at the same
time, while a fourth would take up
at intervals the entire <hi rend='italic'>Ave Maria</hi>.</q>
</p>

<p>
Not merely were the sacred
words of the composition itself
<q>shaken together in most admired
confusion,</q> but, as we have just said,
the words of other sacred pieces
were foisted among them, so that
they no longer expressed any one
idea. Worse far, the gaps were
even sometimes filled up <q>with
snatches of old songs,</q> the ballads
of the day, and those not always
of the most unexceptionable character.
</p>

<p>
Attempts were also made to vary
the stately measure of the chant.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, all sorts of devices were
introduced in the search for novelty,
and so great had become the abuse
about the period of the Council of
Trent that a celebrated cardinal
declared that some of the church
music of his day was so unfit to be
offered to God that nothing but
invincible ignorance could excuse
from mortal sin those who offered it.
</p>

<p>
At this juncture arose the illustrious
Palestrina.
</p>

<p>
Born in an age of the most vitiated
taste, and himself not quite exempt
from its unfavorable influences
at the opening of his professional
career, his exalted and discriminating
genius was guided to disentangle
the sweet spirit of song from the
mazes in which it was well-nigh lost,
and to rescue his art from the merited
reproaches which it was receiving
on every side. He was encouraged
and assisted in his task by
two saints, S. Charles Borromeo and
S. Philip Neri. When his celebrated
<hi rend='italic'>Missa Papæ Marcelli</hi> was first
heard in 1565, it at once banished
from the churches all the profane
novelties that had preceded it, and
became the model for church compositions
during the next hundred
years, when with Carissimi began
the change to what is modern.
</p>

<p>
When Pius IV., the reigning pontiff,
heard it, he declared it satisfied
all the requirements of sacred music;
in fact, so charmed was he by
<pb n='656'/><anchor id='Pg656'/>
its exquisite strains that he compared
it to the melodies that the Apostle
S. John had heard in the heavenly
Jerusalem, saying that another
John (Palestrina's Christian name
was John) had given us in the earthly
Jerusalem a foretaste of the music
in heaven.
</p>

<p>
From that day to this the use of
Palestrina's music has been retained
in the Pope's own choir, to the exclusion
of all other except the simple
plain chant, with which it is
made to alternate. Even when the
Pope officiates or presides at any
celebration outside his own chapel,
his choir accompanies him and sings
the same music.
</p>

<p>
It is this music, <hi rend='italic'>alla Palestrina</hi>,
that travellers go to Rome to hear,
especially during Holy Week. One
generation has thus followed another
to Rome for three hundred
years; and the harmonies of Palestrina,
though ever ancient, are, like
the beauty of divine truth, found to
be ever new.
</p>

<p>
Though Palestrina has retained
his hold on the Papal choir at
Rome, music far different in character
from his has been introduced
into the other choirs, even of Rome.
</p>

<p>
The perfection of the organ and
of other instruments used to accompany
the voices of singers, and
the consequent discovery of other
and more scientific complications
in the art of harmony, especially
since the introduction of the natural
discord, the development of
melody, joined with much greater
skill in execution and the incessant
thirst for novelty, have led to
the introduction into nearly all the
churches of compositions in which
the voices and instruments are
heard together in every variety of
combination.
</p>

<p>
Add to this that about two centuries
ago the opera took its rise,
and the dramatic style, followed in
it and developed by it, made its influence
felt in the church.
</p>

<p>
For kings and princes then began
the practice of selecting the
same musician to preside over the
performances of their theatres and
of their chapels; nay, the whole
staff of the theatre was brought
into the chapel on Sundays, as is
done to-day in Dresden. Nothing
better and nothing different was
required for the chapel, except the
substitution of other words and a
toning down of the measures of
the drama, and thus the chapel
became merely a sort of sacred
concert-room.
</p>

<p>
But the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>maîtres de chapelle</foreign> at
these courts were the first musicians
of their day, and their success
in operatic music, sounded over all
Europe, caused their sacred compositions
to be looked on with undiscriminating
favor by the public.
And as the weakness of human nature
is such that inferiors naturally
imitate their superiors, and sometimes
even copy their faults, it became
the fashion to sing in churches
the sacred music used in court-chapels,
especially as this was more
easily obtained, being printed at
the expense of the courts.
</p>

<p>
Besides this, the modern composers
of opera seem to have the
ambition of composing also for
the church. But they generally
forget how very different the church
and the theatre are, and they seldom
care to follow a different
method in the church from that
which gains them applause in the
theatre; and the public are frequently
as forgetful in this matter
as the composers.
</p>

<p>
It must be added that the directors
of choirs seem to have a fatal
habit of following, even in church,
if they are allowed, the <emph>prevailing
<pb n='657'/><anchor id='Pg657'/>
style</emph> set by the latest and most
popular writers for the stage.
</p>

<p>
When the model so successfully
set by Palestrina was first departed
from, and instrumental music used
in conjunction with vocal, there
may have been a certain gain, as
the chant became more melodious
and less monotonous without losing
its depth and solemnity. Gradually,
however, the grave style of the
older musicians disappeared, and
the music of the church has become,
at least in some places, almost
as light and as airy as that of
the theatre.
</p>

<p>
This music sometimes seems written
in derision or contempt of the
sacred words; as, 1, when a prayer
of supplication, such as the <hi rend='italic'>Kyrie
eleison</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>Dona nobis pacem</hi>, is set
to numbers as lively as those of a jig
(frequently the case with Haydn).
2. When the words are omitted,
even though they be of importance;
as the words of the Creed, <hi rend='italic'>qui
ex Patre Filioque procedit</hi> (nearly
always omitted, even in the longest
Masses of Haydn). 3. When they
are interminably repeated or senselessly
inverted. In Mozart's Twelfth
Mass we have: <hi rend='italic'>Crucifixus, et homo
factus est</hi>.
</p>

<p>
What shall we say of the operatic
solos, duos, trios, etc., instrumental
interludes, sincopations, etc., which,
to any one who reflects, are in direct
contradiction to all our notions of
what is reverent and appropriate
to the church?
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>II.</head>

<p>
From what has been said in
the preceding pages, there are
three general forms of church music:
the plain chant, the music
termed <hi rend='italic'>alla Palestrina</hi>, and modern
figured music.
</p>

<p>
(a.) Plain chant is the old and
original song of the church, of
which the forms, like those of a
dead language, are fixed and immutable.
Long, long ago the secret
of plain chant <emph>composition</emph> was
lost, and it is probable that we
have lost in great measure also the
secret of its proper <emph>execution</emph>.
</p>

<p>
<q>The leading idea which is represented
by plain chant,</q> says Canon
Oakeley,<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>A Few Words on Church Choirs and Church
Music.</hi></note> <q>and in no degree
by any other style of music, except
that which consists in bare recitative,
is that in certain cases music
best discharges her office by retreating,
as it were, in despair before
certain divine words, and contenting
herself with merely providing
a vehicle for their utterance, so
simple as not by any studied beauty
of its own to detract from their
intrinsic majesty and power. This,
I think, will be admitted to be the
leading idea of plain chant, though
I am far from denying that accidentally
this idea produces some
of the most attractive charms of
the divine art in its results....
In many of these accidental instances
plain chant not only excels
other music, but absolutely
sets it at defiance in its own particular
line.</q> Hence a celebrated
musician is reported to have said
that he preferred the plain chant of
the Preface and the <hi rend='italic'>Pater Noster</hi> to
all he himself had ever written.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning this chant was
not even harmonized. It was
plain and unadorned, as its name
implies&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>cantus planus</hi>.
</p>

<p>
(b.) The music of Palestrina is
the last and triumphant result of
the efforts that were made in his
time and before it to vary, to modify,
and to adorn the plain chant,
which all had found too simple and
too monotonous.
</p>

<p>
Pope John XXII., elected in 1316,
<pb n='658'/><anchor id='Pg658'/>
complains of the novelties introduced
into the execution of plain
chant in his day. These innovations
he condemns as unbecoming
and undevotional, especially the
attempts to vary the measure; but
he immediately adds: <q>We do not
intend by this to prohibit that occasionally,
especially on festival
days, either at the solemn Masses
or the other divine offices, some
harmonious combinations (<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>consonantiæ
quæ melodiam sapiunt</foreign>), viz.,
harmonies of the octave, the fifth,
the fourth, and such like, on the
simple ecclesiastical chant, be sung;
in such manner, however, that the
integrity of the chant remain untouched,
and nothing of this grave
and stately music (<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>musica bene morata</foreign>)
be changed, especially since
<hi rend='italic'>these harmonies delight the ear, excite
devotion, and prevent the spirit of
those who sing to God from drooping</hi></q>
(<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>torpere non sinunt</foreign>). (Extr.
Comm., lib. iii., cap. 1, <hi rend='italic'>Docta Sanctorum</hi>.)
This Constitution is the
earliest utterance of the popes concerning
church music&mdash;at least since
innovations were attempted&mdash;that
we possess. The abuses of which
Pope John XXII. complained continued
to exist, and even to increase,
till the time of the Council
of Trent, when Palestrina produced
that style of music which is known
by his name, and which, though
built upon the plain chant, is as unlike
it as Grecian is unlike Italian
architecture. It is equally unlike
modern music. It differs from
plain chant, being an unbroken series
of artistically-constructed harmonies,
in which unison is unknown.
It differs from modern music
by the absolute disuse of instruments
of any kind (even the organ),
by the exclusion of all passages for
<hi rend='italic'>soli</hi>, and by being written in plain
chant tonality. <q>With the grave
Gregorian melody, learnedly elaborated
in rigorous counterpoint, and
reduced to greater clearness and
elegance without any instrumental
aid,</q> says Picchianti, <q>Palestrina
knew how to awaken among his
hearers mysterious, grand, deep,
vague sensations that seemed
caused by the objects of an unknown
world, or by superior powers
in the human imagination.</q><note place='foot'>Apud Bellasis, <hi rend='italic'>Memorial of Cherubini</hi>.</note>
</p>

<p>
(c.) Modern music differs essentially
from all that went before it,
and this difference is attributable
to two principal causes: 1. The
improvement in the manufacture
and the use of instruments, and
their introduction into the church;
and, 2, The influence of theatrical
music on that of the church, before
alluded to. Modern music could
not be in ancient times, for the
want of modern instruments. As
the perfection of the art of vaulting
gave us that advance on the simple
lines and heavy masses of Grecian
architecture which we have in
Gothic and Italian architecture,
so the modern developments in
orchestration have changed the
whole character of music in the
church and out of it.
</p>

<p>
The influence of operatic music
on that of the church is seen in the
attempt of modern composers of
church music to make it dramatic.
Church music, as Palestrina and
the other great masters of the old
Roman school had conceived it,
had been treated as an emanation
of pure sentiment, stripped of all
human passion&mdash;as something ideal.
The modern composers, on the contrary,
pretend by their music to express
dramatically the sense of the
text. They say that, to be dramatic,
it is not necessary to be theatrical,
and they point to certain compositions
<pb n='659'/><anchor id='Pg659'/>
of Cherubini, Beethoven, Hummel,
and even Haydn, in which they
say the contrary is practically demonstrated.<note place='foot'>Cf. <hi rend='italic'>Bellasis</hi>, loco cit.</note>
</p>

<p>
It must, however, be confessed
that modern composers, by trying
to be dramatic, have more frequently
fallen into the great fault of
being theatrical than they have
avoided it.
</p>

<p>
The use of instrumentation and
of dramatic expression has given
them immense scope, but their success
bears no proportion to their
talents, their opportunities, their
numbers, and the immense quantity
of their compositions.
</p>

<p>
Like the Athenians of old (Acts
xvii.) spoken of by S. Paul, they
incessantly crave something new,
and, in their search for novelty,
more often give us what is novel
and strange than what is beautiful
and appropriate, so that their
compositions hardly ever continue
to be used for a long time; they
are soon thrown aside and forgotten;
and, indeed, we think it no exaggeration
to say that, if all their
compositions, except a very few, were
burned, or should otherwise perish,
the church would suffer no loss.
</p>

<p>
In consequence of the failure of
modern composers to meet the requirements
of Catholic devotion,
though their music has been introduced
into our churches and given
every chance of trial, complaints
against it are heard on every side.
We grumble about it in our conversations;
we write against its excesses
in the public journals; bishops
complain of it in pastoral letters;
provincial councils are forced
to issue decrees about it; the
Sovereign Pontiffs themselves not
unfrequently raise their voices,
sometimes in warning, sometimes
in threats&mdash;in a word, the evil
seems to have attracted general attention,
as a similar evil did in the
time of John XXII. and at the
period of the Council of Trent,
and a remedy is called for.
</p>

<p>
I. On account of the unsatisfactory
character of most modern compositions,
some have proposed that
we should go back plainly and simply
to the original or plain song.
This was proposed in two able articles
in <hi rend='smallcaps'>The Catholic World</hi>,
Dec., 1869, and Feb., 1870, and the
Paulists of New York have actually
made the experiment.
</p>

<p>
The reasons in favor of the resumption
of plain chant and the
exclusion of all other music may
be stated thus:
</p>

<p>
1. It is the original song of the
church; it is of venerable antiquity;
it was originated under ecclesiastical
influences, and has been sanctified
by having been always associated
with what is best and holiest
in the history of the church.
</p>

<p>
2. It is so dissimilar from the
music of the world that it is recognized
at once and by everybody as
ecclesiastical, and can never be
confounded with secular music.
</p>

<p>
3. It possesses, when well sung,
an air of stateliness and solemnity
which is never reached by all the
refinements and artifices of modern
music. If it is less dramatic than
figured music, it is also more expressive,
because in it the words of
the ritual speak for themselves naturally
and without affectation, and
therefore most eloquently; whereas
in figured music the words are
made so subservient to the musical
numbers, are so senselessly repeated
and so jumbled together, that
their meaning is disguised rather
than conveyed, and they cannot
speak intelligibly to the mind, especially
of the uneducated. Now,
<pb n='660'/><anchor id='Pg660'/>
S. Paul says that psalmody should
speak to the understanding; and
Benedict XIV., speaking of S. Augustine,
who used to be moved to
tears by the Ambrosian chants he
heard at Milan, says: <q>The music
moved him indeed, but still more
so the words he heard. But he
would weep now also for grief; for
although he heard the singing, he
could not distinguish the words.</q>
</p>

<p>
No one will dare to say that to
the ninety-nine one-hundredths of
every congregation the Requiem of
Mozart, with all its beauty of melody
and its wealth of harmony,
would be as expressive and as provocative
of the feelings proper to
the funeral service as the old and
ever-charming plain chant Requiem.
</p>

<p>
4. Plain chant is the best safeguard
against vainglorious display
and its host of attendant evils, because
it allows no scope for personal
exhibition, and does not give
undue prominence to individuals.
</p>

<p>
5. It is the only chant used in
many places, and is found sufficient
for the purposes of worship.
</p>

<p>
6. It alone has had the express
authorization of the church.
</p>

<p>
This is a fair exposition of the
arguments in favor of plain chant.
</p>

<p>
We admit the full force of the
arguments derived from the venerable
antiquity of plain chant, its
Christian origin, its long and exclusive
connection with the rites
of religion, its dissimilarity with the
music of the world, its simplicity,
its impressiveness, and its incompatibility
with individual display;
but it must be remembered against
it that it requires for its execution,
especially here, where the knowledge
of it and the taste for it are
to be acquired, conditions not easily
fulfilled; that its range is very
limited; and that, however grand
the impression it sometimes creates,
its resources are soon exhausted;
whence to those who for a long
time hear it and nothing else it becomes
extremely monotonous, and
burdens the ear with a dull weight
of sound not always tolerable. This
will be admitted by all who in seminaries
and monasteries have been
most accustomed to hear it.
</p>

<p>
In those countries where plain
chant is exclusively used every
sort of device is resorted to on festival
days to escape its monotony,
<hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>, by harmonies on the chant
which are out of all keeping with
it, as also by interludes on the
<hi rend='italic'>grand orgue</hi>, by which one-half of
the words of the text are absolutely
omitted, and the recollections
of the world are frequently as
vividly brought to mind as by any
modern vocal compositions.
</p>

<p>
No one will deny the appropriateness
and impressiveness of plain
chant on certain solemn occasions,
especially those of sorrow,
but it is confessedly unequal to the
task of evoking and expressing the
feelings of Christian joy and triumph.
If the plain chant Requiem
is superior to Mozart's, the Masses
of Haydn are far more suitable to
the joys of Easter-day than anything
we can find in plain chant.
</p>

<p>
The writer in <hi rend='smallcaps'>The Catholic
World</hi> before alluded to tells us
that plain chant prays. Give me,
he says, the chant that prays. But
prayer is fourfold, like the Sacrifice
of the Mass; viz., it is latreutic&mdash;that
is, the homage of adoration; it
is propitiatory, inasmuch as it tries
to appease God's anger; it is impetratory&mdash;that
is, it asks and supplicates
for what we need; but it is
also eucharistic&mdash;that is, it gives
God praise and thanksgiving.
Now, if plain chant expresses better
our feelings of adoration and
<pb n='661'/><anchor id='Pg661'/>
supplication, it certainly must borrow
from figured music the triumphant
strains of praise and
thanksgiving.
</p>

<p>
However, if the argument from
authority for plain chant held good,
notwithstanding all we have said,
we should instantly waive further
discussion. But the force of this
argument we absolutely deny.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Burney has created the impression
that the Council of Trent
was at one time on the point of
banishing figured music from the
church. This was not the case.
Benedict XIV. (l. xi., c. 7, <hi rend='italic'>De Syn.
Diœc.</hi>), following Cardinal Pallavicini,
the historian of the council,
says: <q>It was proposed by some
bishops, zealous for ecclesiastical
discipline, that musical chant
should altogether be banished from
the churches, and the plain chant
alone retained; [but] as others observed
that this novelty [<hi rend='italic'>sic</hi>] would
give rise to innumerable complaints
and immense trouble, it was finally
resolved, not that musical chants
should be prohibited, but that they
should be reformed, according to
certain rules, to the requirements
of piety and gravity.</q> And, in fact,
the Council of Trent merely decreed
that Ordinaries should banish
from their churches that music
in which, either by the organ or by
the chant, <q>anything lascivious or
impure is introduced, in order that
the house of God may seem to be
and may be a house of prayer</q>
(Sess. xxii., <hi rend='italic'>Decr. de obs. et ev. in
cel. Missæ.</hi>) The other decree (Sess.
xxiv., cap. 12, <hi rend='italic'>De Ref.</hi>) adds nothing
to this.
</p>

<p>
The teaching of the theologians
is much more lenient than that of
many of our modern dogmatists.
</p>

<p>
The great theologian, Suarez (<hi rend='italic'>De
Orat. Voc.</hi>, lib. iii., c. 8), arguing
against Navarre, a rigorist of his
day, says: <q>It is a sufficient argument
that this use (of organic or
figured music) is retained throughout
the church, and that in the
very church of Rome itself, and in
the chapel of the Sovereign Pontiff,
the divine offices are sung after
this manner.</q> He then proceeds to
comment as strongly as any one on
the danger of excesses and abuses;
only he does not seem to feel, either
with the objectors of his day or
with some writers of the present
time, that figured music is intrinsically
mischievous, any more than
that it is ecclesiastically irregular.
</p>

<p>
A later and better authority,
Benedict XIV., speaking as a theologian
in his work <hi rend='italic'>De Synodo Diœc.</hi>,
loco cit., and as Pope, in his Constitution
<hi rend='italic'>Annuus</hi>; 19th Feb., 1749,
addressed to the bishops of the
Pontifical States, says that it would
be an extreme measure to banish
figured music from the church, and
that he considers it sufficient to
banish such music as is theatrical
(<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>modi theatrales</foreign>).
</p>

<p>
Much has been made of the plea
that plain chant is the only chant
that has ever been expressly authorized.
</p>

<p>
Now, it must be remembered, 1,
that when plain chant originated,
music was not used outside of the
church, and that in the dark ages
churchmen were the only ones who
knew music, and that the church
was necessarily its guardian; and,
2, that for three hundred years
the church has treated her <emph>authorized</emph>
version with strange <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>incuria</foreign>;
for of this chant there is now
no version <emph>commanded</emph> (though the
differences of versions are very remarkable
indeed), and till within a
year or two there was no version
to which any special <emph>authorization</emph> or
even <emph>recommendation</emph> was given by
the popes. Even the version now
<pb n='662'/><anchor id='Pg662'/>
being prepared under the supervision
of the Roman Congregation
of Rites is merely recommended.
</p>

<p>
We must be excused for this long
argument about plain chant, but
we have been forced into it by the
exaggerations of the advocates of
this chant, who are, like some of
the advocates of Gothic architecture,
extremists, and in their zeal
fear not to censure the whole
church, and even the Pope himself.
</p>

<p>
They indeed censure the church;
for the use of figured music has
penetrated everywhere with episcopal
sanction and Papal toleration,
and, say what we may, it must be
admitted that all the theories advanced
for the exclusive use of
plain chant have invariably fallen
to the ground under the hand of
practice.
</p>

<p>
We deny, then, the obligation of
confining ourselves to plain chant,
if we except that which is in the
<hi rend='italic'>Missal</hi> and the <hi rend='italic'>Pontifical</hi>, and which
contains what is sung by the priest
or bishop at the altar.
</p>

<p>
But while we deny the obligation
of using the plain chant exclusively,
we would retain a large portion
of it, 1, because there are parts of
it so appropriate to special services
that we can invent nothing better;
such as the Requiem, the Lamentations,
the <hi rend='italic'>Veni Creator</hi>, and many
hymns, and the incomparable
psalm tones, as charming to-day as
when heard by S. Augustine, who
says of them: <q>As the voices
flowed into my ears, truth was instilled
into my heart, and the affections
of piety overflowed in tears
of joy.</q> 2. Because, like our vestments
and other appendages of our
ceremonial, it carries us back to
the never-to-be-forgotten past. 3.
Because by being used alternately
(as in the Papal choir) with music
of a different and more modern
character, it contributes most powerfully,
by the effect of contrast, to
the dignity and grandeur of church
celebrations.

<p>
I return to some incidents in our
journey to and arrival at Dublin.
Goold's Cross is the nearest station
to the Rock of Cashel, from which
it is distant about five miles. We
alight here. We go to visit one who
is kin and more than kind. His
lares are enshrined at Mora House.
An Irish conveyance, called a covered
car, takes us thither pretty
comfortably. There are three kinds
of cars for the transportation of
travellers in Ireland, not including
the <q>low-backed car</q> which is, or
was, designed for the movement of
farm produce, and, according to
Sam Lover, of rustics on ante-nuptial
expeditions intent. Apropos,
I did not see a specimen of the
<q>low-backed car</q> from Queenstown
to Kingstown. That time-honored
and poetical vehicle seems
to have given place to a modern
box-cart, in the East and South at
least. The three varieties of car
above mentioned belong to the
genus known as jaunting-cars.
First, there is the <q>outside car,</q>
on which the passengers are seated
facing outward and back to back.
The space between the backs of
the sitters is railed off into a place
for baggage&mdash;or, <hi rend='italic'>Anglicé</hi>, luggage&mdash;called
the <q>well.</q> It is one of the
wells in which truth is not always
to be found. At the front end of
<q>the well</q> is a raised seat for the
driver. The <q>outside car</q> furnishes
seats for from two to three
persons on each side. When the
seats are not full, the driver usually
sits on a side <q>to balance the
cyar.</q> The <q>inside car</q> is the
converse of the <q>outside.</q> In the
former the sitters face each other;
their legs are in a space between
the wheels, instead of outside them,
as on the latter. It is entered by
a small door at the back. The
driver occupies a raised seat in
front. The <q>covered car</q> is an
<q>inside</q> with a high, square covering
of black oil-cloth. It is used
in rainy weather. It has some disadvantages.
You can see only
through the curtain at the back.
There are no openings at the sides,
and the small glazed apertures in
front are placed too high to admit
even of an occasional glimpse of
the face of Nature. You can only
see the dame from behind. Both
the <q>inside</q> and the <q>covered
car</q> have a tendency to tilt backwards.
You are eternally slipping
down the seat toward the door. A
sudden start may drop you out like
a too well-warmed plate from the
hand of a greedy guest. I came
near dropping out once or twice in
a ride of a few miles. In one of
these conveyances it is wise to take
a double hitch around infant America.
</p>

<p>
A hearty welcome meets us at
Mora House. It is situated in the
heart of a most lovely country.
The house is embowered in trees
<pb n='664'/><anchor id='Pg664'/>
and shrubbery. The walls, offices,
and outhouses are covered with
ivy. Along the front of the house
is a conservatory. Around it are
parterres with evergreens and early
flowers, and borders of dark-green
box. Broad pastures, spreading
their green slopes into the distance,
are relieved here and there by
clumps of tall oaks. Cattle and
sheep dot the landscape, giving it
life without taking from its beautiful
repose. In the background the
Rock of Cashel, with its ruins and
lofty round tower, rears its grim
silhouette against the evening sky.
The frame of the picture is completed
by the mountains of misty
blue in the far distance. Among
them towers the peak from which,
according to tradition, his sable
majesty&mdash;in a very hungry moment
doubtless&mdash;is said to have taken a
<q>Devil's Bit.</q> Over all this is
spread a sky half blue, half cloud,
with the softest of clare-obscures.
What a feeling of peace steals over
my soul as I look upon this sweet
landscape! What a lovely spot for
that retirement, <q>friend to life's
decline,</q>
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<l><q rend='pre'>To husband out life's taper at the close,</q></l>

</lg>

</quote>

<p>
Alas! there is no such gentle
decline for us, poor nomads of the
New World! We must work with
tongue, or pen, or sword, or pencil
by the failing light of the lamp
until the last of its flickering rays
dies into darkness for ever.
</p>

<p>
After luncheon our gentle cousin
takes us to look at his horses and
his dogs. One is a Mount St. Bernard,
a colossal brute and a prime
favorite. Then we visit his kitchen
garden, and his cows, and his bee-hives,
and, in short, everything that
is his. Next we examine the paintings
and the photographs; among
the former a life-size oil-painting,
by O'Keefe, of an uncle, a university
man, a brilliant scholar, who
sat in more than one professor's
chair.
</p>

<p>
Thus we occupied the time until
dinner was announced. Then we
sat down to one of those long-drawn-out,
old-fashioned dinners
which commence at six in the evening
and end any time before midnight.
Gentle cousin, having heard
the Lady from Idaho express a desire
to see an Irish turf-fire, had
one made in the dining-room; and
a bright, pleasant, cheerful, cleanly
fire it is. We persuaded the ladies
to honor in the breach, for this
once, the absurd British custom of
withdrawing from the table after the
dessert. What a pleasant evening
we spent!
</p>

<p>
Next morning we found rain still
falling. It softened the atmosphere
without obscuring it. The Rock
of Cashel loomed up grimly but
distinctly in the distance.
</p>

<p>
There is now little that is regal
about <q>Cashel of the Kings.</q> It
has its ruins, but nothing else. The
approaches to the ruins show more
of poverty and discomfort than I
remember to have seen in any other
town in Ireland. There is a majesty
about the ruins. The rock
on which they stand is about three
hundred feet high. There is a
lofty round tower in a good state
of preservation. The frescos in
one of the halls, said to have been
the council-chamber, are in a state
of wonderful freshness. The floors
of some of the apartments in the
second story seem as perfect as
ever they could have been. The
carved stone-work over the porch
of one of the entrances&mdash;to Cormac's
Chapel, I think&mdash;is the admiration
of connoisseurs. Every
foot of this ground awakens a historical
<pb n='665'/><anchor id='Pg665'/>
remembrance. I see the
rude rulers of ancient Ireland assembled
in their regal state. The
second Henry and Edward Bruce
pass before my mind's eye. I see
that fierce and unscrupulous nobleman,
the eighth of the Geraldine
earls of Kildare, and think of his
astonishing ideas of right and
wrong. When Mormon Harry took
him to task for burning the Cathedral
of Cashel, he pleaded as his
excuse that when he fired the
church he thought the bishop was
in it! What a pleasant neighbor
Lord Gerald must have
been!
</p>

<p>
We have a delightful drive to the
little old town of Thurles. The
green of the fields and the hedges
is enhanced by the contrast of
thousands of soft, yellow primroses.
How purely fresh those primroses
look! Here bunches of violets
peer forth bashfully, their modest
little faces freshly washed by the
gently-dropping rain!
</p>

<p>
Thurles is a station on the Great
Southern and Western Railway.
There we take rail for Dublin. It
is an old town with a quaint old
ivy-mantled tower which dates from
the XIIIth century. The tower
stands by a bridge, and watches over
an infant stream that becomes a
broad river before it reaches the
sea. It is a relic of the time when
Thurles was a walled town. Thurles
is the seat of the Catholic Archbishop
of Cashel. There are two
convents, the Presentation and the
Ursuline. The Sisters of the former
institution devote themselves to
the education of the poor. The
Ursuline Sisters have an academy
for young ladies of the wealthier
and more aristocratic classes. The
Presentation school gets a share of
the Government educational fund,
and is subject to the supervision of
the Government inspectors. The
mode of teaching in the Presentation
school is very similar to that
of the public schools in New York.
The children sang in chorus remarkably
well. There is also a
collegiate institution for the education
of candidates for the priesthood.
We visited both convents,
and were kindly and hospitably
received.
</p>

<p>
Among the objects most worthy
of a visit is the cathedral, which in
taste and magnificence of decoration
promises to surpass all modern
ecclesiastical buildings in Ireland.
It has rich marbles from
Italy, fine specimens of native
marble, <foreign rend='italic'>lapis lazuli</foreign> and <foreign rend='italic'>verd-antique</foreign>,
in stones that are worth their weight
in gold. Some of the work on the
altars is exquisite. The cathedral
will be a superb memorial of the
piety and taste of the present archbishop,
Dr. Leahy. We had the
pleasure of visiting, and being visited
by, that distinguished ecclesiastic
and most refined and courteous
gentleman. Very kindly and hospitably
did he entreat us.
</p>

<p>
About four or five miles from
Thurles are the ruins of Holy Cross
Abbey. Our ride thither was
through a delightful country in all
the humid beauty of an Irish spring.
The ruins are not extensive. They
have been so often and so minutely
described that a detailed description
is not necessary here. Besides,
I am not writing a guide-book. I
must mention, however, a stone balustrade
which is quite artistic in its
effect. The principal window is a
splendid piece of work. It is in
excellent preservation. There are
a number of tombs of considerable
age in the abbey. Near the principal
window is one to which a singular
legend is attached. It was
related to us by the guardian of the
<pb n='666'/><anchor id='Pg666'/>
place, an old woman of eighty,
but hale and hearty, chatty and
cheerful&mdash;such a pleasant female
Old Mortality as the immortal Sir
Walter would have loved to study
and depict. I have often wondered
at the cheerfulness with which the
old among the Irish poor bear the
burden of lengthened existence.
The tomb is of stone, and in its upper
surface is a hollow. The old
woman told us that it was worn by
a rain-drop which for many years
fell unceasingly from the roof until
the constant dropping wore into the
stone the hollow that we saw. The
drop began to fall on the commission
of some crime, or some offence
against the church&mdash;she did not
recollect which&mdash;by <q>one of the
family</q>&mdash;<q>perhaps some trouble
with the priest of the parish.</q> It
continued to fall, drip, drip, drip,
rain or shine, year in and year out,
until the crime was atoned for,
or the offence pardoned, or the
family sold out and left the country.
Then the drop ceased to fall, and
has never fallen since.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you think the story is really
true?</q> asked the Lady from Idaho
of the old custodian.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do I think its thrue, ma'am?</q>
said the old woman, giving her territorial
ladyship a diplomatic look.
<q>Shure, it isn't for the likes o'
me to be denyin' the likes of that.
And shure, ma'am, can't you see the
hole for yourself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course. There is no better
proof than that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And don't you see, ma'am, that
it's rainin' now at the very minnit
that I'm talkin' to ye?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There certainly can be no
doubt about that,</q> replied the Lady
from Idaho, glancing upwards at
the umbrella which Cousin George
held over her head.
</p>

<p>
<q>And don't you see, ma'am, that
niver a dhrop falls on the tomb
where the hole is, now?</q> added the
old woman triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I do indeed,</q> replied Mme.
Idaho. <q>That last argument is
conclusive. Even if it were not, I
am of easy faith in such matters.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And wisely so,</q> chimed in Cousin
George. <q>Doubting Thomas
makes a miserable traveller. He
loses the pleasures of travel in the
search for proofs that he is not enjoying
himself without proper warrant.
If he finds evidence for us
that our pleasures of association
are not justified by fact, that we
have no right to be pleased by legends
he can disprove, we tell him
he is a fool for his pains. We do
not want his facts. We are determined
to believe in our favorite
legends, in spite of him and all the
Gradgrinds in the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
The old woman looked at Cousin
George with rather a puzzled air.
She had listened most attentively,
leaning her old head forward, and
with withered forefinger pushing
back her mob-cap from her time-dulled
ear; but Cousin George's
harangue was evidently Greek to
her. She instinctively divined,
nevertheless, that George was talking
on her side of the question;
for she said, nodding her head approvingly
the while:
</p>

<p>
<q>Faith, and shure it's mighty
right ye are, yer honor!</q>
</p>

<p>
A gratuity, calculated according
to the American standard, resulted
in a series of blessings and a succession
of antique <q>dips,</q> known as
<q>courtesies</q> by the Irish peasant
women of a past generation.
</p>

<p>
We took the cars again at
Thurles on our way Dublin-ward.
</p>

<p>
There is an air of comfort and
solidity about the few farm-houses
we notice on our route, but they
were indeed few. The proportion
<pb n='667'/><anchor id='Pg667'/>
of land under tillage was comparatively
very small. The country
seemed generally to be in pasturage.
Large flocks of sheep and
herds of cattle were to be seen.
The small proprietors and farmers
had disappeared. We saw a couple
of women working in the fields.
This annoyed the Lady from Idaho
very much. She said that no matter
how beautiful the landscape
might be, that blot destroyed all
her enjoyment of it. Our travelling
companion, Viator, bade her
season her admiration for a while
until she reached the interior
of Germany, where she would see
many a team of wayward sisters
harnessed to the plough and driven
by a beery lord of the creation.
Mme. Idaho said she did not want
to go where such sights could be
seen.
</p>

<p>
We pass Kildare, with its
world-famed <q>Curragh,</q> an extensive
flat, on which a few thousand
British troops were encamped at
the time. At every station we find
a policeman or two casting argus
eyes over things in general. Physically,
the policemen&mdash;the <q>Royal
Irish Constabulary</q>&mdash;are among
the finest specimens of the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>genus
homo</foreign> I have seen. They are tall,
generally over six feet, and magnificently
moulded. Their uniform,
though somewhat sombre, is in
good taste: a dark, green tunic and
trousers, with a small, visorless forage-cap
ornamented in front with
a harp in scarlet.
</p>

<p>
Clondalkin, which is within a few
miles of Dublin, possesses a round
tower in excellent preservation. It
is about eighty feet high. The entrance
is about twelve feet from
the ground. It has four openings
or windows some ten feet below
the roof.
</p>

<p>
We are in Dublin, at King's
Bridge terminus, so called from
being near the bridge erected over
the Liffey to commemorate the
visit to Dublin of the fourth of the
royal personages so unflatteringly
designated by the author of <hi rend='italic'>Childe
Harold</hi>. A charming Irish landscape
greets the eye as you approach
the city; on the left the
prettiest portion of the Liffey and
the Phœnix Park; on the right a
gently-undulating expanse of green
fields bordered by old trees and
dotted with ancient churches and
picturesque cottages, bounded in
the distance by the soft outline of
the Wicklow Hills.
</p>

<p>
One of our party expected to
meet a brother whom he had not
seen since they were both boys
nearly a quarter of a century ago.
Arrived at the terminus, and once
more restored to liberty by the unlocking
of the carriage-doors, he
looked around anxiously for the individual
he expected to find waiting
for him. He could pick out
no one in the crowd whom he could
claim as a brother.
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not think there is any one
here,</q> said Mr. Hibernicus with an
air of disappointment, after vainly
peering into the faces of a dozen
gentlemen, who seemed rather surprised
by his close scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
<q>What kind of a brother do you
expect, Mr. Hibernicus?</q> asked
the Lady from Idaho.
</p>

<p>
<q>I assure you, my dear madam,</q>
replied Mr. Hibernicus, <q>I have
not the remotest idea what Jack
looks like now. He was quite a
boy when we parted, and I have not
seen even a photograph of him
since. I hoped that instinct would
reveal to me, as to honest Jack
Falstaff, the <q>true prince.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
We stood irresolute for a moment,
when a gentleman with a
long beard <foreign rend='italic'>à l'Américaine</foreign> approached
<pb n='668'/><anchor id='Pg668'/>
our group. Raising his
hat, and acknowledging the presence
of ladies by a bow, he said to
Mr. Hibernicus, who was still endeavoring
to bring his instinct into
play:
</p>

<p>
<q>May I ask, sir, if you are looking
for anybody?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am looking for my brother,
sir,</q> replied Mr. Hibernicus. <q>Permit
me to inquire if you expect any
one?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I expect my brother,</q> returned
the gentleman.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you Jack?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am Jack.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How are you, Jack?</q>
</p>

<p>
And the brothers, after a vigorous
hand-shake and some inquiries
after <q>So-and-so,</q> took things as
coolly as if they had only been
parted a quarter of an hour instead
of a quarter of a century.
</p>

<p>
Decidedly, people born to the
English tongue have a horror of
anything approaching to demonstrative
sensibility. They have nothing
dramatic about them. What
a <foreign rend='italic'>scène</foreign> two Frenchmen or two
Italians would have made out of
such a meeting after many roving
years! During the days when a
generous and romantic credulity
gave me undeserved credit for
burning the midnight oil over
Homer and Horace, I had a
French student-friend named l'Orient&mdash;an
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>ami intime</foreign> of six months'
standing. L'Orient made a six
weeks' trip to England, and I was
at the station to receive the great
traveller when he returned.
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Te revoilà toi! Comment vas-tu?</foreign></q>
said I, putting forth my hand
for a friendly shake. But l'Orient
was not to be put off with anything
so commonplace as the usual English
pump-handle reception.
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Enfin, je te revois!</foreign></q> he exclaimed,
throwing his arms around me,
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>ce cher ami! Ce brave Jeem!
Ce vieux de la vieille!</foreign></q> And putting
a hand behind each of my
ears, thus rendering escape impossible,
he kissed me vigorously on
both cheeks. Then we walked toward
our hotel, l'Orient holding
my hand in his. We met Jules;
and l'Orient left me, and threw
himself on Jules: <q>Ce cher Jules!
Ce brave Jules!</q> etc., etc., and performed
a double osculation on
Jules. Next we met Victor, and
then Benoit and several others, each
of whom was accosted by l'Orient
and embraced in the same effusive
manner. Our two brothers meet
after a separation of half a century
with a simple <q>How are you,
Jack?</q> and a hand-shake. What demonstration
would be lively enough
for my old friend l'Orient under
such circumstances? Yet l'Orient
did not feel a tithe of what Jack
and his brother felt. I often think
it would be better for us if we were
more demonstrative. We should
perhaps be better satisfied with ourselves,
and perhaps others would
be better satisfied with us also.
</p>

<p>
I had directed my telegram from
Queenstown to a wrong number,
but the telegraph people took the
trouble to find the person to whom
it was addressed. I have had occasion
frequently to use the postal
telegraph. I have found its management
admirable. The post-office
department is also excellently
well conducted. If there is any
possibility of delivery, a letter is
sure to be delivered. One of my
friends writes a hand so hard to
decipher that I can generally
achieve most success in unravelling
its mysteries by turning his missives
upside down and studying
his hieroglyphics in an inverted
position. He wrote to me at Dublin,
and addressed me at a street
<pb n='669'/><anchor id='Pg669'/>
unknown to the Dublin directory.
In New York this would have
been the last of the letter. The
Dublin post-officials referred the
letter from one postal district to
the other until the person to whose
care it was addressed was found,
and it was forwarded to Paris,
where I happened to be at the
time.
</p>

<p>
Dublin occupies both sides of
the Liffey. The river runs through
the city from east to west. The
streets along its banks are subdivided
into <q>quays.</q> The banks
are faced with granite, of which
the parapets are also constructed.
The river is spanned by nine handsome
bridges, seven of stone and
two of iron. The river streets extend
about three miles on either
side. Each block, as we would say
in New York, has a different name.
Thus there is Usher's Quay, Merchants'
Quay, Wellington Quay,
etc., on the north side, extending
from the Phœnix Park gate to the
North Wall Lighthouse. On the
south side are Arran Quay, King's
Inn Quay, where the Four Courts
are situated, Upper Ormond Quay
and Lower, Eden Quay, Custom-House
Quay, etc. The entire
street reaches from King's
Bridge to the end of the South
Wall at Dublin Bar Lighthouse.
The Liffey may be considered as
the diameter of a circle in which
Dublin is contained; the circular
roads which run around it describe
the circumference. West of
Carlisle Bridge, which is the head
of navigation, the Liffey is a dull
and uninviting stream, especially
at low water. It is not more than
eighty yards wide. The mouths
of the sewers which empty into it
are some feet above low-water
mark. Their contributions to its
by no means pellucid flood are not
agreeable to contemplate either
from an æsthetic or from a sanitary
point of view. I should suppose the
quays to be unhealthy places for
residence. One must have the
suicidal mania very strong indeed
who would throw himself into the
Liffey between King's and Carlisle
Bridges. Beyond King's Bridge
you get into the country, where the
stream is not defiled by the filth
of the city.
</p>

<p>
Sackville Street is the principal
street of Dublin. It is about twice
as wide as Broadway, but is not
longer than from Canal Street to
Houston Street. Its shortness
takes away from its impressiveness.
At the foot of Sackville Street
stands Nelson's Pillar, a Doric column
about a hundred and twenty
feet high, with a figure of the great
admiral leaning against a capstan
on the summit. A fine view can be
had on a <emph>clear</emph> day (which is not
always to be had) from the top of
the monument, to which you may
ascend by a spiral staircase in the
interior on payment of a small fee.
The steps at the base of the column
are generally occupied by
squatting idlers of all ages. On a
fine day&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, when it does not rain&mdash;every
inch of sitting space is occupied.
Belated <q>squatters</q> may be
seen waiting for hours until place
is made by the retirement of some
of the sitting members. Then a
general rush is made for the vacant
place. Here the politics of the
nation and of the universe are discussed
by the unwashed politicians
of the Irish capital. I endeavored
to ascertain how these squatters
manage to live; but I was told that
it is one of those mysteries which
no one can penetrate.
</p>

<p>
The General Post-Office and the
Rotunda are near the monument.
The Post-Office is a fine structure
<pb n='670'/><anchor id='Pg670'/>
of stone with a portico of Ionic
pillars five feet in diameter. Its
pediment is surmounted by three
statues: Ireland at the apex, Fidelity
on the left, and Mercury on
the right. In certain post-offices
that we wot of Mercury would indeed
be the right statue in the
right place, and might be considered
to have a double significance&mdash;as
a celestial messenger and a
patron of thieving post-office
clerks.
</p>

<p>
Certain tourists have claimed for
Sackville Street the proud pre-eminence
of being <q>the finest thoroughfare
in Europe.</q> I do not
think the claim well founded. I
do not consider it equal to some
of the new boulevards in Paris, or
even to some of those in Brussels.
It is certainly grand and imposing
as far as it goes, but it does not go
far enough. Sackville Street, however,
presents a lively scene on a fine
afternoon. Beautiful women, well-dressed
gentlemen, rich toilets,
and magnificent equipages may
then be seen; the toilets superior
to anything to be seen out of Paris,
the equipages not to be equalled
out of London. Nothing that I
have seen on the Continent of Europe
can compare with the <q>turn-outs</q>
and <q>cattle</q> driven in Dublin.
The most beautiful equipage
I have noticed, and at the same
time the chastest in its elegant simplicity,
was that of Earl Spencer,
the present viceroy; four dark
bays&mdash;blood-horses&mdash;with postillions
and outriders in a dark livery
almost black, with white buckskin
breeches and top-boots. Not a
brass button or strip of tawdry
gold lace to be seen. Compared
with this equipage, the state carriages
at Buckingham Palace and
those at Versailles looked like circus
wagons.
</p>

<p>
Carlisle Bridge, the <foreign rend='italic'>embouchure</foreign>
of Sackville Street, being considerably
narrower than the street, is
generally the scene of something
like a <q>Broadway jam.</q> On a busy
day it reminds one of the Fulton
Street crossing&mdash;even to the policeman.
</p>

<p>
The <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>élite</foreign> of Dublin, however,
will be found in Grafton Street
about four <hi rend='smallcaps'>p.m.</hi> This street, though
narrow&mdash;narrower even than Broadway&mdash;is
the brightest, cheeriest
street in Dublin. It is laid with
asphaltum, and is delightfully free
from mud or noise. It is the fashionable
shopping-street. Equipages
in the very perfection of good
taste may be seen in long lines at
both sides of the street in front of the
principal shops, while ranks of magnificent
<q>Yellowplushes,</q> in rich liveries
and powdered heads, wait, with
the grand imperturbability of flunky
dignity, to open the carriage-door
for madame or <q>my lady.</q>
</p>

<p>
I have already said that the
Irish in Ireland are becoming a serious
people. I did not meet a single
specimen of the Irish joker, indispensable
to the tourist in Ireland
a quarter of a century ago. If he
ever existed as they represented
him, the railways have killed him.
Now there is no time for display
of wit, so called. I think the extinction
of the genus <q>joker</q> is
something to be grateful for. I did
not see any evidence of suffering
among the laboring classes or any
more raggedness than in England,
France, or Germany. Artisans are
becoming scarce, and can command
good wages. It is hard to get agricultural
laborers; they can almost
set their own terms. Those who
may be obtained cannot be kept
very long; they work merely to save
enough to join their relatives and
friends in the Land of the Free.

The traditional costume of the
stage Irishman is as rarely seen in
Ireland as the short-waisted, long-tailed
coat, and striped trousers of
the stage Yankee in the United
States. I saw but one pair of
<q>knee-breeches</q> between Cork and
Kingstown.
</p>

<p>
I did not encounter a single
shillelah.

</p>

<p>
<q>You are happy, then!</q> F. Chevreuse
said to Mr. Schöninger the
next evening when they were talking
together.
</p>

<p>
His companion repeated the
word with a doubting inflection.
<q>I have always associated the idea
of happiness with excitement,</q> he
said; <q>and I am too calm for that.
I should say that I am deeply satisfied.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger had been rehearsing
in the church the music
for the next day, and F. Chevreuse
had sat in the sanctuary listening,
marking with what will and effect
the leader accomplished his work.
He showed small regard, indeed,
for the vanity or the personal dignity
of the singers he was training,
but the success was admirable. If
the men and women around him
had been organ-pipes or keys, he
could scarcely have treated them
with less ceremony. When the rehearsal
was over, he dismissed
them without a word, except the
command to be promptly in their
places the next morning. Knowing
the touchiness of singers in general,
and the peculiar touchiness of
some of his own choir, the priest fully
expected to see some manifestation
of resentment among them; but
they seemed merely surprised and a
little awe-struck, and, after a momentary
hesitation, withdrew in silence,
leaving the organist alone in the
loft, with the soft gloaming painting
the air about him, as he closed
the instrument with tender care,
and drew the curtain about it.
</p>

<p>
While waiting for him to come
down, the priest perceived for the
first time a lady dressed in deep
mourning, who knelt near the door,
and who quietly followed the singers
from the church. Miss Pembroke
had the habit of visiting the
Blessed Sacrament at this hour;
and she was, moreover, making a
Novena, which she had begun the
night before, with a special intention.
In that Novena her dear
Sisters at the convent had joined,
only Sister Cecilia knowing what
the intention was.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger went into the
house with F. Chevreuse, and stood
with him at an open window looking
out in that exquisite hour when
day and night meet in mid-air, the
sunset not yet relinquishing all its
rose and gold, the night drawing
only her tenderest film of purple
across the sky, and crushing back
<pb n='672'/><anchor id='Pg672'/>
her trembling stars like glimmering
tears crushed between dark-fringed
eyelids.
</p>

<p>
The two men looked out, both
unconsciously pleased because the
evening was beautiful and spring in
its freshness, and consciously thinking
of other things.
</p>

<p>
<q>They are all taking their places
again,</q> Mr. Schöninger said, after
looking upward a moment in silence.
<q>My patriarchs and prophets!
I hated to see them discrowned,
and growing dim, and
fading away into myths. Now they
burn out again with a greater splendor
than ever. The church of the
fulfilment has never shown such
men as my prophetic church. The
glory of the later ritual is theirs.
When the church which sees would
express her emotion, she borrows
the song of the men who foresaw.
They were a grand race. I would
like to build a church, and dedicate
it to King David, and have a stone
statue of him playing on his harp
over against the altar.</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse smiled, but said
nothing. He was watching with
intense interest the development of
this new Christian, who took his religion
as he might have taken a
crown. Mr. Schöninger had an
odd way of performing what in any
one else would have been acts of
humility with a proud unconsciousness,
or an unconscious pride that
was a little puzzling. Of what is
commonly called piety he showed
not a sign; yet he did without hesitation
or apparent effort what ordinary
piety shrinks from. One
might say that he possessed a sublime
common sense, which, perceiving
the relative importance of God
and man, worshipped God as a
matter of course, taking no thought
whether man were pleased or not.
Certainly, had any religious persecution
threatened him, he would
have taken it as a piece of astonishing
impertinence.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse had only just
checked in himself an intention to
compliment the convert on what he
took to be the bravery of his profession
of faith the evening before,
finding that Mr. Schöninger had
been as disregardful of the crowd
who had listened to him as if they
had been wooden posts; and he
refrained also from referring to the
cool <q>Oh! come to think of it, I
do not eat meat to-day,</q> with
which he had that day, at the hotel
table, sent his plate away in the
face of a score of staring people,
who, however, did not venture to
smile.
</p>

<p>
If any one had exhorted him not
to be ashamed of God, he would
probably have asked simply, Do
you think I am a fool?
</p>

<p>
Their conversation approached
this topic after a while.
</p>

<p>
<q>One thing that has always astonished
me is the mean spirit so
many Christians have,</q> Mr. Schöninger
said. <q>Their religion seems
to degrade rather than ennoble their
character. They make such grand,
heroic talk because they overcome
some contemptible temptation
which a pagan should be ashamed
to yield to, and seem to regard
themselves as constant proofs of
special divine interposition because
they are not habitual liars, thieves,
and robbers. They delight, apparently,
in calling themselves miserable
and worthless, which is a shame
to them and a contradiction of
God. If they had been so worthless,
the Almighty would not have
taken so great pains to be reconciled
to them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are regarding the dignity
of man, not that of God,</q> remarked
the priest quietly. Then, seeing
<pb n='673'/><anchor id='Pg673'/>
that his companion did not
understand his meaning, added:
<q>These expressions of humility
and abasement come with sincerity
only from those souls which, gazing
heavenward, have seen so much of
the glory of God that they shrink
to nothingness in comparison. It
is by looking at him that they grow
small in their own eyes, and their
little faults, if you would call them
so, become so mountainous in appearance.
There is, indeed, an
immense dignity in man, but he
loses in contemplating it; for there
is sure to grow up in his soul as
immense a pride and egotism. We
are quite safe when we leave our
honors to the guardianship of the
God who gave them, and occupy
our minds in caring for his honor,
which was once so fatally lost sight
of that all mankind were smitten
with a curse. We are a fallen race.
Adam and Eve could once walk
with heads erect in the face of
heaven, but no human being since.</q>
</p>

<p>
Seeing his pupil frown, F. Chevreuse
added more lightly: <q>But I
do not think it worth while to
make the devil of too much consequence.
Our Lord said, <q>Get thee
behind me, Satan.</q> Now, most
people would be afraid to have the
devil behind them. They would
be continually peeping over their
shoulder to see what he was about.
His great strength is in our misconception
of him. I don't suppose
any man ever yielded to him
and consented to offend God but
he was astonished afterward to see
how easily he might have conquered,
and how small was the bribe for
which he had sacrificed so much.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The devil, too,</q> said Mr. Schöninger
with an odd little smile.
<q>Must I accept him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No; you must reject him,</q> retorted
the priest.
</p>

<p>
And then came question after
question. How did the church
explain this? What was the meaning
of that? F. Chevreuse found
his philosophy and theology somewhat
tested by this searching questioner,
who, without doubting, wished
that all things should be made
plain to him.
</p>

<p>
<q>I always had a tender feeling
for Christ,</q> he said, <q>and sometimes
a slight questioning if he might not
be the Messias; but only last night
were the needed links supplied
which made my fragmentary acquiescences
a single conviction. But
though satisfied with Christ, I am
not satisfied with religion as I see
it. There are too many trumpery
glozes and comments and complications.
I like common sense in
religion, and without it religion
has no dignity in my eyes. Nothing,
not even his humility and
love, was more conspicuous in the
character of Jesus Christ than his
common sense and consistency.
How honest he was! I say it with
all reverence and adoration. How
free he was from evasion and policy,
and that prudence which is
founded on an infinite number of
small lies! He always detected a
fallacy, and exposed it; and he was
constantly appealing to the reason
and good sense of his followers.
When he propounded a mystery, it
was not a mystery because it was
involved and obscure, but because
it was so great that we could not
see all the parts of it. His mysteries
hang like suns in space. How
little there is in common between
his transparent nobleness and the
petty tricks of, I must say, the majority
of Christians, their weights
and measures for the offences they
may dare against him, and those
which are over the permitted guilt,
their excuses, their compromises!
<pb n='674'/><anchor id='Pg674'/>
Why, sir, there never was a time
when I did not think, there never
will be a time when I shall not
believe, that the greatest foes to
the Christian church are Christians
themselves.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are quite right,</q> F. Chevreuse
answered with an air of sorrow
and mortification. <q>There is a
vast difference between Christ and
Christians. He is God, and we are
men. And it is the thought of this
difference which makes us walk
with that downcast face which so
offended you a few minutes ago.
Do not come to too many decisions
at once. Wait, and learn by experience.
Here in your reach now is
all the splendor of faith, a free gift
for you to work out your life by.
Your privileges are peculiar. You
have had no sacrament to misuse;
and when you are baptized, you
will stand as new and sinless a man
as Adam was at his creation. In
that instant, if your intention is
pure, you will possess heaven in
your soul. It does not often fall to
the lot of a man to be sure of such
happiness. Let us see how you
will use the privilege. Show us, if
you will, the ideal Christian, and
we will be glad to see and imitate
him. But beware of pride!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear friend!</q> exclaimed
Mr. Schöninger, <q>I did not mean
to be presuming nor to wound you.
I am sure you do not wish me to
say it, but to me you, at least, are
perfect.</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse laughed slightly.
<q>Only wait and see,</q> he said.
<q>And now a score or two of penitents
are waiting to confess, and F.
O'Donovan is wondering if I am
going to let him stay in the confessional
till midnight. I must leave
you. Why do you not go up and
see Mrs. Ferrier? She has been
anxiously inquiring for you to-day,
and complaining a little. Go and
make the good soul happy. Miss
Pembroke will be glad to see you
too, I am sure. She has gone to
live with Mrs. Ferrier. They do
not receive company; but send
your name in, and you will be welcome.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I had forgotten them both!</q>
Mr. Schöninger said with some
compunction. <q>I will go at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse soon found that he
had been mistaken in two of his assertions;
F. O'Donovan was not in
the confessional, and Miss Pembroke
was not at that moment in
Mrs. Ferrier's house. Both had
gone to the convent, one called
there, the other hastening to follow
when she knew his errand.
</p>

<p>
Little Anita was dying, killed by
her first vision of the wickedness
and agony of the world. She had
heard of sin as one living far inland
hears of the ocean, which he has
never seen; and now the bitter
waves of that wide, salt sea she believed
so far away and alien had
rolled in about her. It touched
her feet and her garments, and left
its poisonous rime there; it caught
and strangled before her eyes those
she had trusted and been near to;
it tossed its sacrilegious foam on to
the very altar of God. Her soul
trembled within her, and she turned
her face away from life, and hid
it in the bosom of her Lord.
</p>

<p>
<q>O my God! my God!</q> she
prayed. <q>Forgive me! but I cannot
live.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was no physical malady;
but the heart, which, like a busy
shuttle, tosses to and fro its rosy
threads, weaving soul and body together,
faltered, and let slip link
after link. The invisible folded
wings detached themselves, trembling;
the spiritual hands left the
bodily hands cold, and stretched
<pb n='675'/><anchor id='Pg675'/>
out into eternity, trembling, always
trembling; the whole soul, still full
of the fear and agony of the world,
shrank outward.
</p>

<p>
The Sisters knelt about her,
cruelly grieved. Was this delicate
saint to be torn away from them
thus, leaving them no consolation
but the memory of her blameless
life? Was she to go down to the
grave without a sign of victory?
Were they to keep for ever this
last vision of her, prostrate in the
shadow of that low portal?
</p>

<p>
And even while they prayed, just
giving up hope, as the slight form
grew cold and rigid, all at once
it shone out like a marble statue
on which a sudden sunbeam falls.
The eyes flashed wide open, the
shining soul stood tiptoe in them
an instant, then parted softly.
</p>

<p>
It is not for us to follow, even in
fancy, the flight of that innocent
soul, nor to witness the tears of
mingled sorrow and joy which the
Sisters shed over their young companion,
nor to listen to the prayers
they said, nor the sacred communings
they held together.
</p>

<p>
Our business is with earth, with
Honora Pembroke, driving homeward
soberly through the still evening.
</p>

<p>
<q>Drive slowly,</q> she said to the
footman&mdash;not John now. <q>There is
no haste.</q> And she added to herself:
<q>I want a chance to think.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was, indeed, little chance
to think in her new home; for
good Mrs. Ferrier, who did her
thinking with her tongue, could not
conceive any need for solitude, and
was constantly breaking in upon
the few moments of retirement
her young friend allowed herself to
ask if she had <q>got through,</q> if
she were ill, if she would please to
come down, or if she objected to
company. And then would come
the recapitulation of her trials, her
fears for her daughter, and lamentations
without end. That Miss
Pembroke herself might be sad and
troubled, and stand in need of
cheering and sympathy, did not
seem to enter her mind.
</p>

<p>
So thus early in their intercourse
the young woman was fain to seize
every excuse for a moment of solitude.
Whether she would have
taken advantage of this had she
known that a visitor awaited her
return is doubtful.
</p>

<p>
The drive was not interminable,
however, and it was still early in
the evening when she reached the
house and entered. She stopped
at sound of a voice in the drawing-room.
It was Mrs. Ferrier
who spoke, but her words were
quite sufficient to tell whom she
spoke to.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall never, never get over
your having been treated so&mdash;never!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam,</q> said Mr. Schöninger
with a decision which scarcely
covered his displeasure, <q>I request
as a favor that you will never again
mention this subject to me. I am
sorry for your trouble in the matter,
and grateful for the kindness
you have shown me; but you must
see that it is something of which I
do not wish to be reminded.</q>
</p>

<p>
Miss Pembroke's impulse was to
go immediately up-stairs. A kind
of terror seized her at the thought
of meeting him. What if he
should know that she was making
a Novena, and what it was for!
</p>

<p>
She stopped one moment, irresolute,
then went into the bright
drawing-room where the two sat.
Mrs. Ferrier uttered a little exclamation,
not having heard her come;
but Mr. Schöninger had heard the
carriage, the door, even the step
that paused at sound of their
<pb n='676'/><anchor id='Pg676'/>
voices, and half divined that he
had come near not seeing Miss
Pembroke that night.
</p>

<p>
She gave him her hand with dignified
and earnest friendliness. <q>I
cannot tell you how happy you
made us all last night,</q> she said.
<q>You are welcome.</q>
</p>

<p>
He found something haughty in
her mode of address, like that of a
queen speaking to a subject, and
looked at her intently to discern its
meaning, if possible.
</p>

<p>
Alarmed at his searching expression,
she turned abruptly away
from him with unmistakable haughtiness
this time. But no sooner
had she done so than, smitten by a
swift recollection of the folly and
injustice of the act, she returned
with a glance and gesture so full
of mute, impulsive penitence that
it more than atoned; it explained.
</p>

<p>
The proud surprise in his face
melted to a quiet smile. He resumed
his seat by Mrs. Ferrier,
and began to talk with her, taking
no further notice of Honora for a
few minutes. But when he saw
her sitting silent and pale, her momentary
trouble forgotten in the
recollection of the solemn scenes
which she had witnessed in the
last few days, he spoke to her.
</p>

<p>
<q>I hope you will take some interest
in my choir,</q> he said; <q>for I
wish to improve it very much.
The material is bad, the greater
part of it. Those persons seem to
have been selected who had loud,
blatant voices and a firm belief that
they were excellent singers. They
make noise enough, and are not
afraid; but they are vulgar singers.
I want a choir of boys in addition to
them. You must know some good
voices among the children.</q>
</p>

<p>
She brightened. It was a pleasant
surprise to hear something in
common life spoken of, and to
have one who knew all assume that
all was not lost.
</p>

<p>
<q>I know a good many such
voices,</q> she said; <q>and I should
be glad to help you. Could not I
make the selection, and teach them
the first lessons? It would be
small work for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If you would be so good,</q> he
replied, quite as if he had expected
the offer.
</p>

<p>
And so, without more words,
Miss Pembroke was installed as
Mr. Schöninger's musical assistant.
It was a timely employment
and interest in her changed life,
and exerted a softening influence
on his. He gradually relinquished
the designs he had meditated, and
looked on his sufferings in a more
impartial light. Whatever prejudice
had existed, he could not
doubt, when he examined the subject
calmly, that he had been condemned
on a reasonable array of
circumstantial evidence, and that,
without prejudice, any other man
would have been condemned on
the same evidence. Besides, even
had there been a chance of success
in the attempt, he could not have
received as much in legal reparation
as was voluntarily given him
by the public. The city was, in a
manner, at his feet. The highest
officials, both in private and in
their public capacity, tendered to
him their respect, their regrets, and
offers of any assistance he might
need. People felt that they could
not do too much for him. It was
quite true, as Mrs. Ferrier said to
him: <q>Now is the time for you to
break the law, if you want to. You
could do anything, and no one
would find fault with you for it.</q>
</p>

<p>
For the real criminal, who shall
say how it happened that he was
not brought to justice? There was
certainly an immense activity in
<pb n='677'/><anchor id='Pg677'/>
searching where he was not. The
law put on its most piercing spectacles,
then shut its eyes and
looked in every direction. The
spectacles saw nothing. If they
were on the point of having a
glimpse, they were instantly turned
in another direction. We have all
seen such justice when wealth and
influence are on the side of the culprit.
Letters came from Annette
to her mother with only the smallest
circumlocution, and answers
were sent to them with the most
transparent diplomacy in the world.
</p>

<p>
<q>When my poor Gerald heard
of his mother's death,</q> Annette
wrote, <q>I thought for a while that
he would die. He lay for hours
almost insensible, and only revived
from one swoon to fall into another.
But he soon recovered from the
first shock, and is, I think, glad to
know that her sufferings were so
short. But he says nothing, and I
do not talk to him. I wait to see
what God will do with his soul.
He is like a frail building that has
been overthrown so thoroughly that
not one stone remains upon another,
and is being built up again
in a different shape. I can perceive
a strength in the new foundations
of his life which I had not believed
him capable of. Indeed, he is not
humanly capable of them. But this
is the city of miracles, and ours is
a miraculous faith. As I have told
you, he says nothing. His life is
almost an absolute silence, and, I
might say, blindness to earthly
things. I never see him looking at
any beautiful or sublime object except
the crucifix. Even I seem to
be only a voice to him. He begins
lately to show a disposition to be
active, which is to me a sign that
his mind is becoming settled.</q>
</p>

<p>
Annette did not think it best to
describe the nature of the activity
that her husband was showing, well
knowing that it would have made
Mrs. Ferrier believe herself to be, in
addition to her other afflictions, the
mother-in-law of a maniac. For
the work he did, here and there,
wherever it could be quietly done
without attracting attention, was
menial. She had seen him help the
poor man unload his cart of stones,
or take the spade from his hands to
labor in his stead, and he was constantly
performing menial labors in
the house. All this was done, not
with any appearance of being an
eccentric gentleman, but as one of
the poor. For day by day his dress
had been growing rude and his
whole aspect changed. The sun
had burnt his fair skin and faded
his unshorn beard, and, by means
best known to himself, his delicate
hands had become dark and rough.
Looking at the firm, silent lips
and downcast eyes, Annette could
scarcely doubt that the man she
had called her husband was gradually
and purposely effacing all the
beauty and daintiness of which he
had been so proud. He never went
out with her, and if by chance they
were likely to encounter in the
street, he avoided the meeting. No
one, except the people of the house
where they lived, suspected that
there was any acquaintance or connection
between this dainty <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>signora</foreign>
and this man, who grew every day
less and less to be distinguished
from the common laborer.
</p>

<p>
But in humbling himself Lawrence
Gerald had not been unmindful
of the one earthly duty remaining
to him. <q>Are you willing to
give me up entirely, Annette?</q> he
asked her one day.
</p>

<p>
She answered with a brief affirmative.
<q>Follow wherever God leads
you,</q> she said; <q>and do not stop
an instant to think of me.</q>
</p>

<pb n='678'/><anchor id='Pg678'/>

<p>
He was used to depending on
her, and to being sure that she
meant what she said, and could perform
her promises. Yet he wished
to make certain. <q>You have to go
out alone, and have no protection
but that of servants,</q> he said.
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not need any other protection;
I am quite safe here,</q> she replied.
</p>

<p>
<q>You cannot marry again,</q> he
went on.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have no wish to!</q>
</p>

<p>
Perhaps there could not have
been a stronger proof of the purification
which Annette Gerald's character
had undergone than the fact
that this reply was made without a
tinge of bitterness or regret. She
spoke with gentle sincerity&mdash;that was
all. As an absorbing affection had
made her consent to be taken without
love, so now a pity and charity
yet more engrossing enabled her to
find herself discarded without anger.
</p>

<p>
<q>Follow God, and think no more
of me,</q> she said. <q>I remain here.
Go when and where you will.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was the first time they had
spoken together for several days,
and was more by accident, apparently,
than of their seeking. Passing
through the room where Annette
was, Lawrence had seen her
trying to open a window that resisted
her slight hands, and had opened
it for her. Then the sweet clangor
of the Ave Maria breaking out from
all the towers at once, they had
paused side by side a moment.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps he had wished to speak,
and seized this opportunity.
</p>

<p>
At her answer he looked at her
earnestly, for the first time in
months, it seemed to her, and with
a look she could not endure without
emotion, so far-away and
mournful, yet so searching, was it.
It was a gaze like that of one dying,
who sees the impassable gulf widening
between his eyes and what
they rest upon. How many, many
glances she had encountered of
his!&mdash;laughing, critical, impatient,
in the old days that now seemed
centuries past; superficially kind,
penitent, disregardful, careless, but
never from the depths of his soul
till now. Now she knew at last
that his soul had depths, and that,
as she stood before him, he was
aware of her, and saw her as she
was.
</p>

<p>
<q>Annette,</q> he said, almost in a
whisper, <q>words cannot tell my
sense of the wrong and insult which
I have heaped upon you&mdash;on you
more than all the rest put together.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do not speak of that,</q> she said,
trying still to be calm.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of all the women I have hurt
or destroyed, you are the noblest,</q>
he went on, seeming not to have
heard her.
</p>

<p>
She drew her breath in quickly,
and stood mute, looking down, and
some strong band that had been
holding her down&mdash;how long she
knew not, perhaps for years, perhaps
for her whole life&mdash;loosened,
and she felt herself growing upright.
She was like the graceful
silver birch that has been bowed
over by the snow, flake after flake,
till its head touches the ground,
when the warm sun begins to melt
its burden, and it lifts a little, and
feels itself elastic.
</p>

<p>
In days when Honora Pembroke
was his ideal, <q>noble</q> was the
word he applied to her, and Annette
Ferrier always felt herself
grow small when she heard him
utter it.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of all women I have ever
known, you are the noblest and
most lovely,</q> he said slowly. <q>I
was blind. Too late I have learned
<pb n='679'/><anchor id='Pg679'/>
that. And if I had a wish left, it
would be that God would reunite
us in heaven.</q>
</p>

<p>
The snows had melted, and she
stood upright at last.
</p>

<p>
There was a confused whispering
in her brain. Since she was
loved and honored, why need they
part? She could comfort him, be
at his side always, and help him to
win back peace, if not happiness.
They would perform works of
charity together, and in humbling
herself she would raise him.
</p>

<p>
She lifted her eyes, and opened
her lips to speak some such word,
but checked herself on seeing him
turn away. His face was no longer
calm and sad, but full of anguish.
All the enticements of human life
had assailed his soul, and were fighting
against its one stern tenant, remorse.
Silently, and with a feeling
of unacknowledged disappointment,
she awaited the result, scarcely
doubting that he would yield.
When had he not yielded? was the
bitter question that rose in spite of
her, only to be thrust down again
under many excuses, as she called
to mind his sufferings and his isolation.
</p>

<p>
He stood near the window, with
his face turned to the light, and she
watched the struggle without daring
to move or to speak. What silent
clash of warring passion held
him thus rigid she could only
guess; what voices sweet and pitiful
were pleading, and what voices
stern and terrible replying, who
can say? It did not need that
angels of darkness should be there;
the human heart was enough. In
that swift review when the soul, anticipating
a privilege of eternity,
can compress a lifetime into a moment,
what visions of all that life
might give could have presented
themselves!&mdash;dusky eves and sunlighted
mornings, when the singing
of birds, mingled with the prattle
of children, and quiet and elegant
leisure, and smiling friends, made
earthly existence seem like an Elysian
dream; ever-present affection,
with its excuses for every fault, its
recognition, prompt and inspiring,
of every virtue, its cheering word
for the hour of sadness, its loving
check, its sympathy, its silent tenderness;
the freedom of earth
which wealth can give, every portal
opening as if by magic, existence
a perpetual feast. They crowded
upon him mercilessly, and tossed
to and fro his grief and remorse as
the sea tosses its dead, that are
now but faint white outlines, half
lost in froth, now cold faces starting
clearly out of the thin, green wave.
</p>

<p>
How many times that soul was
lost and won in those few minutes
none but the invisible witnesses of
the scene could tell.
</p>

<p>
He moved at length, and Annette
stepped nearer with sudden
alarm, as she saw him put his hand
into his bosom slowly, as if with
dread to draw forth what was there.
The hand closed on what it sought,
and with bitter shrinking, as if it
were his heart he was thus uprooting,
brought it to light. It was no
knife, nor pistol, nor vial of poison,
as she had feared, but a folded paper.
She had seen it in his hands
before, and wondered what he kept
with such care.
</p>

<p>
He opened it and read; and she,
leaning nearer, read also, without
stopping to consider her right.
</p>

<p>
This was the breviary Lawrence
Gerald carried in his bosom, written
largely and clearly, and signed
with his name in full:
</p>

<p>
<q>I am a gambler, a housebreaker,
a thief, a sacrilegious liar, a murderer,
and a matricide.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O my love! stand firm! stand
<pb n='680'/><anchor id='Pg680'/>
firm!</q> the wife tried to say; but
the words died in a whisper on her
lips, as her heart fainted with pain
and delight.
</p>

<p>
He did stand firm without having
heard her admonition. She saw the
unsteady lips close again, the gazing
eyes droop, the whole face and
form compose itself. That brief
reminder, written to be a visible
witness when the voice of conscience
should fail, was more potent
than poison or blade or bullet.
</p>

<p>
<q>I wish to take a room by myself
in another part of the city,</q> he
said. <q>Are you willing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly!</q> she replied. <q>But
I would like to know where it is.
Not,</q> she added quickly, <q>that I
would intrude or trouble you in
any way. But you cannot expect
me to lose all interest in you, and I
shall feel better to know where you
are, and to go once to see your
room and the people you are
with.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will let you know as soon
as I find a place,</q> he said. <q>Of
course I wish to support myself,
to be removed from all society, except
those persons whom I must
see, and to wait my time in penance.
You understand it all, Annette. I
no longer exist in the ordinary life
of men. I am either in purgatory
or in hell&mdash;I do not yet feel sure
which.</q>
</p>

<p>
He was going away, but turned
at a little distance, and looked at
her once again. <q>My dear,</q> he
said faintly, <q>good-by!</q>
</p>

<p>
She could not utter a word, could
only clasp her hands over her face,
and so lose his last glance. For as
he spoke that farewell, and as she
heard his retreating step, the door
of her sealed and frozen heart burst
open, and her dead love, stirring
uneasily in its grave during these
last days, rose up stronger than
ever before, and resumed the throne
it was never again to abdicate.
There, at last, was a man worth
loving!
</p>

<p>
The next evening she received
his new address; and he added: <q>I
shall be out to-morrow, and the
<foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>padrona</foreign> will admit you, if you wish
to come.</q>
</p>

<p>
Of course she went; but, what
had not been to her a matter of
course, the place pleased her. The
house was in an old and crowded
part of the city, where the streets
swarmed with poor people; but the
room was at the very top, in an odd
corner quite removed from noise
and communication with any other
apartment, and had an eastern and
a northern window that looked off
over palace roofs and through
towers and domes to the beautiful
mountains. Close to its southern
wall pressed a church tower, and
on a level with its windows rose the
sculptured façade, wreathed with
angels. Once there, one might
easily forget the steep, dark stair,
the squalid street below, and even
the bare walls and floor of the
room itself.
</p>

<p>
Annette had not allowed herself
to bring any article of comfort, still
less of adornment, though her heart
had ached with longing to do so.
But she placed a beautiful crucifix
on the one poor table, and left a
volume of lives of saints beside it.
A bunch of roses hung at her belt,
and her fingers lingered on them
in doubt for a moment. But she
checked that impulse also. How
much might roses breathe of woman's
presence there and all the
graces and sweetnesses of life! But
before leaving, she hung over an
arm of the crucifix a single small
bud, where the petals showed like
a drop of blood oozing through the
green.
</p>

<pb n='681'/><anchor id='Pg681'/>

<p>
As she was placing this last souvenir,
her tears dropping over
flowers and cross, there was a sound
as though a hurricane should draw
in its breath before blowing, the
floor of the room trembled, then
there came a tremendous and reverberating
stroke. The great bell
in the tower was striking the hour
of noon, and the chamber shook as
a bird's nest shakes when a storm
sweeps over the tree in which it is
built. For the moment everything
in the universe was obliterated but
sound. She breathed its tremulous
waves, she was enveloped and
borne up by its strong tide; the
very sunshine and the blue of the
sky were like bright, resounding
tones. Then the stroke ceased;
and, circling round and round in
fainting rings, the music of the
bells went out to join the music of
the spheres, perhaps to creep with
a golden ripple up the shores of
heaven.
</p>

<p>
The woman who had opened the
door wondered much to see the pale
<foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>signora</foreign> come down with a face
flushed with weeping; but a liberal
gift disposed her to think the best
of everything.
</p>

<p>
<q>You must be very good to him,
and not allow any one to intrude,</q>
Annette said to her. <q>I shall
come to the church here below
every morning at seven o'clock;
and if he should be ill, or any accident
should happen to him, I wish
you to come there and tell me.
But you must not talk to him.
Speak to him only when he asks
you to.</q>
</p>

<p>
That evening she wrote to her
mother: <q rend='pre'>Lawrence has left me,
and is in the arms of God. That
is all I can say, except that I trust
he has won a perfect forgiveness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am sorry, dear mamma, if
you are lonely, but I cannot return
to America. I do not wish for society
anywhere. Here in Rome is
my place, with my religion and the
poor to occupy my time. Try to
be happy, and to think of me as
peaceful and contented. And,
mamma, if there should be any
good, honest man whom you would
like to marry, I shall be glad of it.
Goodness is the chief thing.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ferrier wept profusely over
this letter, not doubting that Lawrence
was dead.
</p>

<p>
<q>The poor fellow!</q> she said.
<q>After all, he wasn't so bad as he
might have been.</q>
</p>

<p>
And then, bethinking herself, she
wiped away her tears, and calmed
her grief as much as possible; for
it would not do to render herself
unpresentable. It was necessary
to go at once with the news to F.
Chevreuse.
</p>

<p>
The way that Mrs. Ferrier took
to the priest's house was a roundabout
one; it led in an opposite
direction, and stopped before a
new dry-goods store of the most
glittering sort. There was, in fact,
no shop in Crichton so fine
or so much frequented as this.
People went there at first from
curiosity, and were disposed to
make themselves very merry regarding
it; but there seemed to be
nothing to laugh at, unless it might
be certain erroneous notions in
their own minds. Everything was
well ordered and business-like, the
clerks attentive and respectful, and
the proprietor perfectly dignified
and watchful. Indeed, a slight excess
of dignity and watchfulness
had at first marked his conduct,
and made his customers wary of
giving offence.
</p>

<p>
We have already intimated that
Mrs. Ferrier had a new footman.
</p>

<p>
This functionary, a slim and sentimental
young man, let down the
<pb n='682'/><anchor id='Pg682'/>
step for his mistress; but before
she had made her majestic descent,
the proprietor of the shop stood in
the door, bowing to his wealthy
customer. She beckoned him out,
and motioned the footman away
out of hearing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Poor Lawrence is dead, John!</q>
she said plaintively, a smile tempering
her grief. <q>And it's best so,
of course. I've just got a letter
from Annette. And, John&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
The lady paused, and looked
down, and laughed a little.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, what is it?</q> asked the
new merchant with an appearance
of curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<q>She's willing.</q>
</p>

<p>
John's face expressed two contrary
emotions at this announcement&mdash;one
of pleasure, the other a
dogged sort of resentment that
Annette's willingness should have
been considered of consequence.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is pleasanter to have everybody
pleased,</q> the lady said soothingly.
<q>Of course, though, it
doesn't make one bit of difference
with me so far as what I shall do;
for you know, John, I'd stand by
you through thick and thin. Now
I must go to F. Chevreuse.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There isn't a more respectable-looking
merchant in the city of
Crichton,</q> said Mrs. Ferrier emphatically
to herself, as she drove
away.
</p>

<p>
<q>Beg y'r pardon, mum?</q> said
the slim footman, leaning over.
</p>

<p>
<q>I wasn't talking to you!</q> exclaimed
his mistress indignantly.
</p>

<p>
It was, indeed, observed by everybody
that Mrs. Ferrier was very
high with this unfortunate man,
who was humility personified, and
only too assiduous in his obedience.
She had assumed a trifle more of
state with all her servants; but the
footman was scarcely allowed to
breathe freely.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shouldn't wonder, now, if he
might think he could marry Annette,</q>
she muttered to herself, as
they drove on.
</p>

<p>
Poor fellow! his ambition did
not soar beyond Betty, and she was
treating him with cruelty. However,
with a story-teller's prescience,
we are fully aware that his trials
are only the little waves which are
sending him nearer and nearer to
his haven, and that before the year
is over the day will be named. Already
in our mind's eye we see the
fair Betty in her bridal robes, with
her magnificent and patronizing
mistress fastening on the veil, and
giving her a kind and resounding
kiss at the same time. We even
hear the small whisper with which
she silences her bridegroom's last
jealous misgiving when he comments
on the salute given her by
the master of the house:
</p>

<p>
<q>What! you think that I could
ever have had a fancy for him&mdash;a
man who drops his h's?</q>
</p>

<p>
The withering contempt of this
remark was decisive.
</p>

<p>
But we are anticipating.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ferrier found the priest at
home, and gave him the letter to
read. He read it attentively, but
came to a different conclusion from
hers. He did not tell her so,
though, for it was evident that Annette
wished them to think that
her husband was dead. Her former
letters had prepared him to
suspect a state of things very near
the truth.
</p>

<p>
After a long conversation, in
which F. Chevreuse perceived that
his visitor was lingering and hesitating
in an unusual manner, Mrs.
Ferrier at last called his attention
to the concluding sentences of the
letter.
</p>

<p>
He read it a second time, glanced
up through his spectacles at his
<pb n='683'/><anchor id='Pg683'/>
visitor, read it again, and gave the
letter back, quite uncomprehending.
He was, doubtless, the only person
in Crichton who could have been
unconscious of her meaning.
</p>

<p>
<q>You may think me foolish, father,
at my time of life, to be thinking
of marrying again,</q> she said
deprecatingly. <q>But you have no
idea how lonely I am. Honora
will soon have a house of her own,
anybody can see that; Annette
won't come back, and Louis won't
live here, after what has happened.
I have nothing to do but wander
from room to room of my great
house, and think how awfully lonesome
I am, and almost wish that I
had a little cabin that I could fill.
I don't feel as if I were in a house,
but as if I were out somewhere.
Many a time I've gone and sat in
my chamber-closet, just to feel my
elbows hit something.</q>
</p>

<p>
She paused, and F. Chevreuse
said, <q>Yes!</q> as sympathizingly as
he could, wondering greatly what
was to come.
</p>

<p>
<q>John is a decent man, and my
equal in everything but money,</q>
she went on.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! it's John!</q> F. Chevreuse
exclaimed, light breaking in.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ferrier dropped her eyes
and smiled.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't see any harm in it, if
you have got your mind made up,</q>
the priest said, recovering from his
first astonishment. <q>I suppose it
would be of no use for me to try to
break off the arrangement, even if
I wanted to.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, John is pretty set,</q> the
lady admitted modestly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I dare say,</q> was the smiling
rejoinder. <q>When is it to be?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In a month, if you please. He
is started in business now, and is
doing well, and there's no reason
why he shouldn't be a great merchant
as well as any other man.
He's capable of it, if anybody is,</q>
she said, becoming a little defiant.
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly!</q> replied F. Chevreuse
with perfect gravity. <q>There
is not a law in the commonwealth
which will prevent his being as
great a merchant as he pleases.
The world of trade is open to John,
and I wish him all success in it.
Do you put your property into his
hands?</q>
</p>

<p>
Instantly the beautiful modesty
of the bride-elect gave place to the
business-like acuteness of the woman
who knew perfectly well the
value of money.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, father, we keep our accounts
separate,</q> she said. <q>He
had half enough to start in business
with, and I lent him the other
half. The income of the whole is
to go toward our housekeeping,
but he will have nothing to do with
the rest of my property.</q>
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse nodded. <q>I see
that you haven't lost your head.
You have managed your own affairs
so well thus far, you may as well
continue to do the same, for your
children's sake.</q>
</p>

<p>
A month later there was a quiet
marriage at the priest's house; and
the only notice the Crichtonians
had of it was when John appeared
again in Mrs. Ferrier's carriage,
this time by her side, instead of in
the dicky.
</p>

<p>
Everybody smiled except Honora
Pembroke. She alone, perfectly
polite, and refraining from all interference,
felt haughtily indignant
at the marriage. It was in vain
that F. Chevreuse tried to reason
away her prejudices.
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not object because he was
poor,</q> she said. <q>Riches are less
a distinction than a difference.
But he has been a servant, and
that is irreparable.</q>
</p>

<pb n='684'/><anchor id='Pg684'/>

<p>
The priest began to hum a tune:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>Ah! ça ira, ça ira, ça ira!</q></l>
<l><q rend='post'>Les aristocrats à la lanterne.</q></l>
</lg>

</quote>

<p>
Somewhat to his surprise, she
blushed slightly, but did not smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>You may think me foolish, or
even guilty of sinful pride,</q> she
said with a certain stiffness; <q>but
this is a feeling of which I cannot
rid myself. I do not like to sit at
table with a person who has once
brought me my soup, nor on the
same seat in the carriage with one
who used to let down the step for
me. Of course I recognize and
submit to the situation; but I shall
go to my own house again immediately.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well!</q> said the priest, <q>it
takes a good while to get acquainted
with people. Here have I
known you these ten years and
more, have seen you simple, unpretending,
humble, apparently,
good to the poor, and going freely
among them. I thought I knew
you thoroughly; yet all at once I
come upon the rock in that smooth
stream. Have I ever caught a
little gray shadow of it before, I
wonder? Well, well! I won't undertake
to blast it out of the way
at once. I am sorry, though, that
you do not like John.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I like him in liveries,</q> said
Miss Pembroke with dignity.
</p>

<p>
<q>I tell you,</q> persisted the priest,
<q>they are going to be a very happy
couple.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I haven't a doubt of it,</q> she replied.
<q>But that is no excuse.</q>
</p>

<p>
He laughed, and let her go.
The haughty recoil of pride in the
fibre was not to be reasoned away.
</p>

<p>
It was a clear afternoon in mid-autumn;
and when Miss Pembroke
stepped from the priest's door, she
paused a minute on the sidewalk,
and hesitated which way to go. She
did not wish to return home, and
she did not think of any other
place where she would rather go.
</p>

<p>
And then, without looking, she
was aware of a tall gentleman, who
came down the street, and, still
without looking, knew that he had
crossed to her side of the street,
and was approaching her. And
then, with a perverseness which
was scarcely natural to her, she
turned quite coolly in the opposite
direction, and walked from him,
perhaps lest he might think that
she wished for his company. Not
but she and Mr. Schöninger were
on the most friendly, and even cordial,
terms&mdash;it was, indeed, taken
for granted in Crichton that they
were the best of friends&mdash;but&mdash;in
short, she walked away from him.
Perhaps she found his full and
prosperous life a little discordant
with her saddened one. She almost
fancied sometimes that he had an
air of triumphant pride, and that
he was being spoiled by the adulation
paid him on all sides.
</p>

<p>
She had been wishing lately that
she could go to Annette; and, now
that Gerald was dead, if the ambiguous
letter they had received
really meant that, perhaps Annette
would like to have her. Miss Pembroke
felt strangely lonely in her
native town, where she knew everybody,
and where she had not, certainly,
to complain of any lack of
attention. But she would be lonely
for ever rather than Mr. Schöninger
should think that she waited on
F. Chevreuse's step for him. He
must have been at the end of the
street when she came out, and&mdash;surely
he would never dare to think
that she saw him, and had been
giving him time to overtake her!
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger was meantime
walking leisurely behind her quickening
steps, intending to overtake
<pb n='685'/><anchor id='Pg685'/>
her presently, but wishing first to
watch her a little, and to think of
some things. One was that he did
not approve of her wearing black
any longer. She was beautiful in
anything, but too sad in this; and,
besides, it interfered with certain
plans of his. He made a slight
reckoning, as nearly correct as the
masculine mind could make it on
such a subject. She might put on
gray, or black and white, immediately.
That would enable her to wear
a rich purple in the winter. He
liked to see her in purple. Some
day, when she should be older, she
must have a trailing robe of purple
velvet with diamonds. Well, in
the spring, then, she could change
her deeper color for one of those
delicate lavenders or lilacs that women
know how to look pretty in;
and then the way would be quite
open for white, and rose, and blue,
and all the fresh, gay colors a bride
might wish to wear.
</p>

<p>
<q>We should be married by the
first of May, at latest,</q> thought the
gentleman very decidedly.
</p>

<p>
Miss Pembroke was quite right
in fancying that there was something
triumphant in Mr. Schöninger's
air; but she did not believe, and
it was not true, her pettish charge
that he was being spoiled by adulation.
All was going well with him.
Hosts of friends surrounded him&mdash;friends
as sincere as any one can
claim; he did not believe they
would stand any great test, but, also,
he did not believe that they were
hypocrites. In his profession he
was winning gold and reputation;
and, what no one but himself knew
as yet, the fortune for which he had
vainly struggled so long was approaching
him of itself. Two of
those who had stood between it and
him had died, and there remained
now but a feeble old man. With
his death all other claims would die.
And not least in his cause of congratulation
was his conviction that
this fair woman, who walked before
him with the black drapery fluttering
back from her light foot, the braid of
hair just showing its glossy bronze
beneath the mourning veil, and, as
she turned the corner of a street,
the curve of her smooth cheek glowing
like a peach, was his own.
</p>

<p>
What made her cheek so red
now?
</p>

<p>
<q>Honora!</q> he said, quickening
his pace.
</p>

<p>
She stopped with a start.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mr. Schöninger!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I beg your pardon!</q> he exclaimed,
recollecting that he had never
called her by her Christian name
before. <q>I was thinking, and I forgot.</q>
</p>

<p>
She walked soberly by his side
without asking what the subject of
his thoughts had been. His exclamation
may have revealed to her
something of their nature; but she
was far from suspecting that she
was engaged, still less that her marriage-day
was fixed. She had, indeed,
no reason to suppose that Mr.
Schöninger had any intention of renewing
the suit that she had once
rejected.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are willing to take a walk?</q>
he asked, and, when she nodded assent,
added:
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us go up the Cocheco.
Last night's frost has added the
finishing touch to the trees, and
everybody is admiring them.</q>
</p>

<p>
A beautiful road, almost as wild
as a country lane, led between the
river-bank and the flowery cliffs
beside it, and here at evening all
the youths and maidens, and many
of their elders in whom age had
not chilled the love of nature, used
to walk soberly in the soundless
path, or climb the cliffs, or sit
<pb n='686'/><anchor id='Pg686'/>
on the mossy rocks, or venture
out on the rocks that studded the
stream. Not a pleasant evening
but found people strolling through
this romantic avenue.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nowhere but in New England
does nature dazzle, I think,</q> Mr.
Schöninger said. <q>See this maple-leaf!
It is a fine scarlet, and as
glossy as a gem, even when examined
closely. And the elm-leaf is
as fine a gold. Everywhere else
the autumn foliage is dingy when
looked at so closely. The sky, too.
Look at those long lines of fire
that are beginning to stretch overhead,
and at the gathering crimsons!
In half an hour the heavens
will be as brilliant as the earth.
In Italy the colors are soft, like the
colors in an old painting; they
have great depth and richness, but
they lack the fresh brilliancy of the
skies in the New World. You
must go to Italy soon, Honora.</q>
</p>

<p>
This time the name was used
without an apology.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have been thinking of it,</q> she
replied quietly, and began to feel
as a stranded seaweed may when,
after having lain awhile painfully
on the dry sand, it finds the bright
sea slipping under it, and lifting it
from its hard resting-place. Without
a word of explanation she
found herself claimed and cared
for.
</p>

<p>
<q>I wish to go there again as a
Catholic,</q> he continued, <q>and see
with the eyes of faith what I saw
before with the eyes of an artist.
I shall always admire most the
Catholicism of America, or what
the Catholicism of America is going
to be. It is more intelligent,
noble, and reverent. It isn't a sort
of devotion that expresses itself in
tawdry paper flowers. Indeed, I
believe that America is destined to
show the world a Catholicism morally
more grand than any it has
yet seen&mdash;a worship of the heart
and the intellect, where children
shall be delighted, and yet common
sense find nothing to regret.
Still, Rome is the sacred city of the
martyrs, the popes, and the temples.
I think we should go there
in two years at latest.</q>
</p>

<p>
He had spoken earnestly, and
had absolutely forgotten how much
remained unsaid, so sure was he of
her.
</p>

<p>
Honora's glance of astonishment
and incredulity reminded him. He
bent a little nearer, smiling, and
said softly: <q>But we shall be married
long before that time, dear,
shall we not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is the first I have heard of
it,</q> Miss Pembroke managed to
say with a certain degree of composure,
after a moment.
</p>

<p>
<q>You surely are not vexed!</q> he
said quickly, beginning to fear that
he had assumed too much. <q>I
asked you once in the proper,
lover-like fashion, and you refused
me, not because you were indifferent
to me&mdash;you never said that&mdash;but
because you would not marry and
would not love one who denied
your Saviour. That obstacle no
longer exists. You did not imagine
that I had become indifferent
to you? That is out of the question.
Have I made a mistake?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No; it is I who have made a
mistake,</q> she answered frankly.
<q>I was afraid that you had given
me up.</q> She hesitated a little, then,
since he still listened, added: <q>I
am very glad that you have not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you!</q> he said.
</p>

<p>
They walked slowly up the road
between the foaming river and the
glowing cliffs, praising the skies
and the trees as they went, finding
everything beautiful, finding each
the other more beautiful than all
<pb n='687'/><anchor id='Pg687'/>
else. And when the evening began
to fade a little, they turned their
steps, and went down again with
the river, filled with that deep and
quiet happiness which leaves nothing
to wish for and nothing to
tell.
</p>

<p>
The very next morning a little
note was sped from Miss Pembroke
to Sister Cecilia with the following
mysterious announcement:
</p>

<p>
<q>My <hi rend='italic'>Novena</hi> has succeeded perfectly!
I will come very soon and
tell you all about it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Since the matter is settled, we
may as well own at once that when
Mr. Schöninger first announced
himself a Catholic, Honora had
said to her friend and confidant at
the convent, <q>If I do not marry
him, I shall never marry any one</q>;
and that the result of this confession
was a <hi rend='italic'>Novena</hi>, in which the
young woman had asked that she
might find favor in his sight.
</p>

<p>
<q>I told him about the <hi rend='italic'>Novena</hi>,</q>
Miss Pembroke said when she
made her explanatory visit to the
convent. <q>And I told him that
you and all the Sisters joined with
me; and he bade me thank you
for his part, and say that he hoped
you would never be sorry for having
done so.</q>
</p>

<p>
But Honora did not tell how
astonished and touched her lover
had been at this confession of what
seemed to her the most simple
thing in the world.
</p>

<p>
<q>I never thought of asking God
for you,</q> he said; <q>and yet there
is nothing in the world so well
worth praying for. I am a very
ignorant Catholic, Honora, in all
except doctrine. You will have
much to teach me. But, then,</q> he
added, smiling, <q>we have all our
lives for that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The only blot on my happiness,</q>
Honora said to her friends,
<q>is the thought of Annette. A
letter came from her last night
which seems to shut us all out from
giving her either society or comfort.
She evidently does not wish to see
any one she has ever known. She
says that her time and thoughts
are entirely occupied.</q>
</p>

<p>
Annette Gerald was fully occupied.
She was like one who stands
at the head of a long flight of winding
stairs, watching another descend,
and, beginning to lose sight
of the object of her attention,
begins to follow slowly, intent, at
the same time, not to be too near
or too far away.
</p>

<p>
It was necessary that she should
keep Lawrence Gerald in sight
without attracting attention either
to him or to herself. As a rich
lady, driving in her own carriage,
she could not do this. She therefore
gave up her carriage, and
moved to an humbler apartment,
where she lived with one servant.
Still, the dainty elegance of the
widow's attire she had assumed,
fastidious in her choice, not consciously,
but from habit, pointed
her out as of a different class from
the people she went most among.
To remedy this, it was necessary
only to be passive; and in a few
months Roman dust and mud and
brambles had reduced her to a
dinginess almost Roman, and she
could go unremarked, could see
Lawrence about his work, digging
in the excavations, carrying stone
and mortar for the masons, doing
any rough labor that offered. She
could see him in the church, where
he spent an hour every morning;
she knew that every Sunday he
entered the same confessional, and,
as she could well guess, told the
same tale to the priest, who, when
his penitent left him, leaned forward
and looked after him with a
<pb n='688'/><anchor id='Pg688'/>
sad and earnest gaze. More than
once, late in the evening, she had
looked up from the street where
her close carriage stood waiting,
and seen, out on the corner of the
open roof, to which no one but he
had access, his form drawn clearly
against the transparent purple of
the sky, and, after waiting as long
as prudence would allow, had gone
away to her lonely apartment, leaving
him there in company of the
marble angels that clustered about
the church front, and the blessed
bells, and whatever invisible spirits
God should will and his own soul
invoke. Never did she see a light
in that lofty window; and, after a
while, it occurred to her to ask the
reason of the <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>padrona</foreign>, who often
came to the church in the hope of
receiving money from the lady.
</p>

<p>
<q>He never will have a candle,</q>
the woman said. <q>I think he is
very poor. And he never drinks
wine or eats meat. And, <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>signora</foreign>,
he is growing very pale.</q>
</p>

<p>
That night Annette Gerald extinguished
the candles in her own
apartment, and never lighted them
again. She could weep and pray
without light. The next day she
dismissed her one servant, and
thenceforward waited on herself.
No ease or elegance must her life
know while his was passed in such
poverty. He ate the dry, sour
bread of the poor; she ate it too.
He discarded every luxury of the
table; she also became an ascetic.
If she put wine or fruit to her lips,
tears choked her, and she set
them aside. As he went down, so
she followed him, unseen, weeping
pitifully, watching constantly, loving
utterly.
</p>

<p>
Without suspecting it, both became
after a while objects of interest
to those about them. No dinginess
or apparent poverty could
hide their refinement; and the extraordinary
piety of both invested
them with a certain sacredness in
the eyes of these people, who had
walked and talked with saints.
The rude workmen ceased, not only
to jest with, but to jest in the presence
of this man who never smiled,
or spoke without necessity, whose
pale face was for ever downcast, and
who, in the midst of Italian indelicacy,
carried himself with the refinement
of an angel. In the long
noon rest of the hot summer days
they withdrew from the place where
he threw himself down, faint with
fatigue and the heat, and left him
to that solitude he unmistakably
desired. Only little children ventured
near the <q>penitent,</q> as he
began to be called, and smiled wistfully
in his face, and kissed the
hand that now and then gave them
a <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>soldo</foreign>.
</p>

<p>
Once, as he lay asleep on the grass,
in the shadow of a ruined arch, an
artist, who was just returning home
from a morning's sketching in the
Campagna, paused to look at him.
The other workmen lounged about
at a distance, some asleep, some
eating their noon luncheon of dry
bread, others smoking and talking.
This one seemed laid there apart
for a picture. Thrown carelessly
on his back, with his hand under
the cheek turned a little aside, and
the hat dropped off, his form and
face were fully seen. It was not
the form and face of a plebeian.
The elegant shape was not disguised
by its faded garments; the beauty
of the face, delicately flushed
with heat, and beaded with perspiration,
was even enhanced by the
unshorn and untended beard and
the confused mass of clustering
hair; and the expression of calm
melancholy, which was not obliterated
even by the unconsciousness of
<pb n='689'/><anchor id='Pg689'/>
sleep, did not belong to a common
nature.
</p>

<p>
The artist drew softly nearer,
and opened his portfolio, too much
engaged to give more than a passing
glance to a woman who stood
by the arch. With a rapid pencil
he sketched his subject, trying to
catch that hovering sadness and
the weary bend of the head.
</p>

<p>
Drawing back presently to see
if he could add anything to his
sketch, he perceived that the woman
who had been standing by the
arch was at his side, watching his
progress.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't let the shadow run off
so,</q> she said, looking at the sketch,
not at him. <q>Show how the sunshine
comes, close to his feet, so
that he has only a step to take to
reach it. And do you see how
those yellow flowers lean against
his hair in the form of a crown?
Put them in too; and the group of
workmen yonder, and a corner of
the excavation, with that beautiful
pedestal half uncovered. As you
have it, it is only a pretty poem
without meaning; give the whole,
and it will be a tragical story.</q>
</p>

<p>
The artist looked intently at the
lady while she spoke. Surely she
must be the sister of the sleeper!
Their two faces would do to stamp
on a coin, the man's profile showing
beyond the woman's.
</p>

<p>
<q>Finish the sketch quickly before
he wakes,</q> she said. <q>I will
pay you whatever you want for it.
Some day I will have you paint it.
Don't forget the red poppies at his
feet. And can you see, can you
show, that there is a blister on his
hand?</q>
</p>

<p>
Wondering much at this strange
sort of poor people whom he found
himself among, the artist obeyed.
</p>

<p>
<q>But I want to keep the sketch,</q>
he said. <q>I will make a copy for
you, if you will come to my studio
for it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly not!</q> she exclaimed,
and for the first time looked at
him with a clear and haughty gaze.
<q>You have no right to keep it,
for you took it without permission.
It would be dishonorable and intrusive
of you to show that to any
person. We are not <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>contadini</foreign>!</q>
</p>

<p>
The artist rose and bowed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Madam, allow me to present
my sketch to you,</q> he said with
equal pride.
</p>

<p>
<q>Some day you will know, and
then you will no longer be offended,</q>
she said calmly, and took the
sketch from his hand just as the
sleeper stirred and began to awake.
<q>And now, I beg you never to notice
him again, or mention him to
any one till I come to you for the
picture.</q>
</p>

<p>
And so three years passed away,
and there came an Easter morning
such as Easters used to be in the
days when the pope was King of
Rome, and there was one city in
the world where the business was
religion.
</p>

<p>
Who can forget the scene, having
once beheld it&mdash;the sky built up of
sapphires, glitter on glitter of such
blue as the queen of heaven might
make her mantle of; the full, warm
gold of the sunshine looking the sad
ruins in the face till they smile, and
revealing its hidden rainbows now
and then, as the foamy columns of
fountains sway in the light breeze,
and catch it unawares; the birds,
with long, pointed wings, that cut
the air, and seem inebriated with the
delight of flying. Then the crowd
in the piazza of S. Peter's, the millennial
mingling of rich and poor,
royal and plebeian, making in all
a scene to be witnessed nowhere
else.
</p>

<p>
<q>How familiar, yet how new!</q>
<pb n='690'/><anchor id='Pg690'/>
said a lady who stepped from her
carriage at the barrier. <q>It is all
I could wish! I am glad, Max, that
we did not come sooner to Rome.
I would rather my first sight of it
should be a festal one.</q>
</p>

<p>
This lady was richly dressed,
and the black lace of her large
Spanish veil was drawn back from
a face like a fresh lily.
</p>

<p>
She was instantly addressed as
<foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>principessa</foreign> by all the beggars
about.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am sorry I cannot give you
the title, Honora,</q> her husband
said, and smilingly dropped a coin
into each outstretched hand. <q>So
nothing disappoints you? I thought
it would be so. Now, we must not
linger outside.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us go slowly up; and
please do not speak to me,</q> Mrs.
Schöninger said. <q>No, I do not
want your arm now. I must enter
S. Peter's the first time praying.</q>
</p>

<p>
They went slowly up the ascent,
Honora with her hands clasped,
and her eyes dilating as they
entered the grand vestibule. Then
Mr. Schöninger lifted the heavy
curtain, and she crossed the threshold.
</p>

<p>
At that first step into S. Peter's
a Catholic feels as though he had
touched the beating heart of mother
church.
</p>

<p>
The crowd pressed in; but still another
crowd remained outside, keeping
their places for the papal benediction,
and listening for the silvery
burst of trumpets inside which
should tell that the risen God stood
on the central altar of Christendom.
</p>

<p>
Among this crowd was a group,
for which they made way, as it crossed
the piazza and approached the
steps. Yet it was only two poor
laborers who supported a sick man
between them.
</p>

<p>
The thin and transparent face of
this invalid, bathed now in the perspiration
of weakness, showed that
he was worn by consumption or by
a long and exhausting fever. He
was so weak, indeed, that his two
assistants supported him in their
arms; and when they reached the
stone posts at the foot of the steps,
he knelt there, and leaned against
one of them, almost insensible.
</p>

<p>
A lady, following closely behind,
wet her handkerchief in cologne-water,
and handed it over his shoulder
to one of the men, but did not
herself speak to them. He revived
a little at that, and, still leaning
against the central post, remained
fixed in prayer.
</p>

<p>
A whisper began to creep among
the poor people about. Some of
them had seen this man, and knew
what they conceived to be his story,
and they told it in intervals of listening
to the strains of heavenly
music faintly heard now and then
from the church.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a penitent,</q> one whispered,
<q>and has been doing penance
here as a laborer, though he is so
rich&mdash;so rich! Some say that he
killed his own mother; but who
knows? The beautiful <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>signore</foreign>!
Look at his face! She must have
provoked him; and perhaps she
was a very wicked woman. Ah! I
could tell stories of mothers. They
are not all like the blessed Madonna.&mdash;There
are the trumpets! Alleluia!
alleluia! Blessed is he who
cometh in the name of the Lord!&mdash;And
so this poor <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>signore</foreign> has been
living a hard life, and is about to
die; and he has come at last to get
the Holy Father's blessing. He
would not ask for it before. But,
indeed, he might, for he is as holy
as the blessed Labré, though he
sleeps in a bed and works for his
living, instead of begging it. The
<pb n='691'/><anchor id='Pg691'/>
pale <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>signora</foreign> who stands behind him
is his sister. She has been in Rome
all these years, watching over him,
without his knowing it. See! she
stands out of his sight now. He
worked up to a week ago, and then
he fell one day in a faint. She was
near by, and called a carriage to
take him home. And since then
she has had a room in the same
house, but told the <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>padrona</foreign> not to
let him know. She is rich, for all
her poor clothes. She puts something
into every hand that is held
out to her. See the way she looks
at him!&mdash;Ah! there they come.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mass was over, and the crowd in
the church came pouring out. It
was with difficulty that Lawrence
Gerald's protectors could keep his
place in that pressure. But that he
had revived, they could not have
done so. With the first intimation
that the moment for which he had
so long waited was at hand, he had
roused himself, and exerted his
whole strength. Upright on his
knees, with his arms clinging to the
post against which he leaned, he
fixed his eager eyes upon the balcony
where the Pope would in a
short time appear. He saw nothing
else, not even two familiar forms
and faces directly in front of him,
which he could scarcely have seen
even then with indifference.
</p>

<p>
<q>My God!</q> exclaimed Honora
Schöninger, and clung to her husband's
arm. <q>Look, Max! It is
Lawrence, and he is dying!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Schöninger drew his wife
aside. <q>It is no time to recognize
him now,</q> he said. <q>And there is
Annette behind him. Poor fellow!
poor fellow!</q>
</p>

<p>
Annette pressed close to her husband,
ready to catch him if he
should fall. She knew that he had
had an exhausting day. He had
risen at early dawn to hear Mass
and receive communion, though not
really able to leave his bed, and
had afterwards spent his remaining
strength in the first careful toilet he
had made for years. After having
so long heaped every indignity on
his own body, to-day he had seemed
desirous of treating it with respect
as the temple of God. He
still wore the dress of the laborer,
but his face was shorn of its ill-tended
beard, his hair brushed once
more into silken waves, and his
linen snowy white. And more exhausting
than these efforts had
been the excitement of mind under
which he labored, and his fear lest
in some way he should miss the
benediction he so longed for.
</p>

<p>
<q>I want to be placed directly in
front of the balcony,</q> he had said,
<q>where I can see the Pope's face.
I shall recognize his face at once.
Who knows but he may look at me?
If he should, then I shall think
that at last God looks at me.</q>
</p>

<p>
The crowd hushed itself, as the
golden cross came in sight, and
after it the crowned and mitred
heads, all in white save one. And
that one, under its glittering tiara,
wore a crown of snowy hair dearer
to Catholic hearts than gold or
jewels. On this central face the
eyes of the sick man fixed themselves
with a wide and imploring
gaze, and his hands stretched themselves
out, as if to beg that he
might not be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do not fear!</q> Annette whispered
in his ear. <q>The Holy Father
knows all your story, and
pities you; and there is one standing
beside him who will remind
him that you are here. He will
know just where you are.</q>
</p>

<p>
To the waiting and trembling
penitent this was like a whisper
from his good angel. He associated
no other thought with the voice.
</p>

<pb n='692'/><anchor id='Pg692'/>

<p>
The silence deepened till nothing
could be heard but the swift wings
of a bird flying over the piazza,
and the soft <q>zitti! zitti!</q> of the
fountains, and the heart that each
one in that vast crowd felt beat in
his bosom.
</p>

<p>
Surely that mild and blessed
face was turned his way! the penitent
thought. Surely, surely, the
Holy Father had looked at him,
searching the crowd one instant
with his eyes, and finding him!
</p>

<p>
Then a single voice was heard&mdash;the
only voice in the universe, it
seemed.
</p>

<p>
<q>May the holy Apostles Peter
and Paul, in whose power and authority
we confide, intercede for us
with the Lord.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Amen!</q> chanted the choir, as
though the world had found voice.
</p>

<p>
Again the single voice:
</p>

<p>
<q>Through the prayers and merits
of blessed Mary ever Virgin, of
blessed Michael the archangel, of
blessed John the Baptist, of the
holy Apostles Peter and Paul, and
all the saints, may the omnipotent
God have mercy upon you, may
all your sins be remitted, and
Jesus Christ lead you to eternal
life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Amen!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Indulgence, absolution, and remission
of all your sins, space for
true and faithful repentance, hearts
ever contrite, and amendment of
life, may the omnipotent and merciful
God afford you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Amen!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And may the blessing of the
omnipotent God, Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, descend upon you,
and remain with you for ever.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Amen!</q>
</p>

<p>
Every stain was washed away!
Full and strong the blessing flowed,
a divine river from the throne of
God himself! On its tide were borne
away, not only guilt, but the memory
of guilt; not only fear, but the
remembrance that fear had been.
Supported in the arms of his wife
and attendants, and of the old
friends of whose presence he was
unconscious, Lawrence Gerald lay
back with his eyes half closed, and
a smile of such peace and ecstasy
on his face as could only come
from God. His soul was gliding
sweetly away on the echoes of that
last amen.
</p>

<p>
The military bands began to
play, the guns boomed from Sant'
Angelo, the bells of S. Peter's
rang out with a joyful clash on the
air, and all Rome broke into music
over the resurrection.
</p>

<p>
And there was joy before the
angels of God over one sinful soul
redeemed.
</p>

<p>
The End.

<head>Madame Du Deffand.</head>

<p>
<q>Men have died, and worms have
eaten them, but not of love,</q> the
poet tells us. And women too have
died, and worms have eaten them,
but not of <foreign rend='italic'>ennui</foreign>, although Mme. du
Deffand for nearly fourscore years
woke the echoes of Versailles and
Paris with the pitiful lament: <q>I
am bored! I am bored! I am dying
of <foreign rend='italic'>ennui</foreign>!</q> If she eventually did
die of it&mdash;which we stoutly deny&mdash;a
malady that took eighty years to
kill its victim can hardly be called
a very cruel one. The vivacious,
gossipping, wearied old lady contrived
to extract a very reasonable
amount of amusement, even of excitement,
out of the existence whose
wearisomeness she was for ever denouncing;
and it is only fair to
add that she contributed a very
goodly share of amusement to other
people. This renowned heroine
and victim of <foreign rend='italic'>ennui</foreign>, Marie de Vichy-Chamroud,
was born into this wearisome
world in the year of grace
1697, of a noble family of the province
of Burgundy. The De Vichy-Chamrouds
were richer in parchments
than in lands; so it fell out
that Marie, young, lovely, accomplished,
and teeming with wit, was
condemned to marry an old man,
and, what was still more terrible, a
wearisome old man, who had not a
single taste in common with her.
Immediately on leaving the convent
where she received what in
those days was considered a liberal
education, the beautiful young lady
was presented to her future lord.
If she bored herself as a young girl,
free and happy, and with life before
her, what must she have done as
the wife of a querulous, stingy old
man? All the revenge that was in
her power Marie took. She bored
her husband as much as he bored
her, until at last, in sheer desperation,
he agreed to give her an annuity,
and let her go her way without
him. As Marquise du Deffand,
free and comparatively wealthy, the
young wife began a new era. She
opened a <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salon</foreign> which soon became
the centre of the wit and fashion
of Paris. All that was eminent in
war, arts, sciences, literature, and
folly came there, and tried to chase
away her eternal <foreign rend='italic'>ennui</foreign>. Amongst
her many admirers, the President
Hénault occupies the most conspicuous
place, both from the dignity
of his own character and the
enduring nature of their mutual attachment.
Hénault was one of the
most remarkable men of his time.
He was educated by the Oratorians,
and had early the inestimable advantage
of enjoying the advice, and
almost the intimacy, of Massillon.
He counted the scarcely lesser privilege
of early personal acquaintance
with the great poet Racine.
As soon as he had completed his
studies, young Hénault was introduced
at court, where he at once
made a favorable impression. <q>This
is not to be wondered at,</q> says a
chronicler of the times; <q>for, in
truth, he was a youth of gracious
parts, gay, witty, amiable, a good
musician, and gifted with the art of
making light and graceful verses.</q>
While the Duchesse de Maine held
her brilliant court, Hénault was a
<pb n='694'/><anchor id='Pg694'/>
constant presence there, and one
of its principal ornaments. He
was so universally beloved that it
was popularly said of him: <q>There
is a man who has more friends than
he can count, and not a single enemy.</q>
And this lucky man was the
devoted admirer of Mme. du Deffand
for over fifty years.
</p>

<p>
He attained considerable fame as
an author, and not the least remarkable
feature in his works is
that their authorship was vehemently
contested, not only during Hénault's
life, but for many years after
his death. Most of his books were
first published anonymously&mdash;a
circumstance which, in their early
career, may have explained the
doubts concerning their origin.
But the <hi rend='italic'>Abrégé Chronologique</hi>,
which Hénault regarded as his best,
appeared with the author's name at
the outset, and this, strange to say,
was the one which the world refused
longest to believe was his, and
persevered in long attributing to
the Abbé Boudot. A copy of the
book was found, in the <foreign rend='italic'>abbé's</foreign> own
writing, amongst his papers when
he died, and this is the only piece
of evidence on which Hénault's
detractors built their obstinate denial
that he was the author of the
<hi rend='italic'>Abrégé</hi>. Admitting that this fact
looked suspicious, the book itself
from first to last bears the stamp
of Hénault's composition in the
most unmistakable manner; the
choice of the subject, its style and
treatment, all point emphatically to
him as the author, while there is
abundant explanation of the accidental
presence of the compromising
copy amongst Boudot's
papers. Hénault was in the habit
of employing him to copy out his
compositions. Voltaire, in one of
his letters to the president, recommends
the <foreign rend='italic'>abbé</foreign> as a very clever
copyist, and also as a useful person
to make researches for him at the
Royal Library; and Grimm also recommends
him for the same purpose,
informing Hénault that Boudot
had employment at the library, and
was in charge of the literary and
historical department. A man who
held this subaltern post, and was
treated as a mere scribe by such
authorities, and who never pleaded
guilty to writing even a pamphlet
in his life, is, to say the least, a very
unlikely person to be the author of
such a work as Hénault's <hi rend='italic'>Abrégé</hi>.
Mme. du Deffand and Grimm, who
both liked to sharpen their wits pretty
freely at the president's expense,
never for an instant doubted the
reality of his authorship, or suspected
that any one had had a share
in his books.
</p>

<p>
Unlike so many of his distinguished
literary contemporaries,
Hénault was a practical Christian.
<q>His piety,</q> says the Marquis de
Agesson, <q>was as free from fanaticism
or bitterness as his books
were from pedantry.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mme. du Deffand, who spared
her friend on no other points, spared
him on this. She never laughed
at his religion. On that score
alone he was safe from her irony
and sarcasm. She even openly
commended him for challenging
Voltaire's impious vituperation of
the faith; and in her own correspondence
with the infidel philosopher
she speaks almost with enthusiasm
of the clear intellect, the
pointed wit, and irresistible goodness
of his antagonist. When he
was past eighty, Hénault wrote
privately to Voltaire, imploring him,
in the most touching terms, to retract
some of his diabolical satires
on religion; and this letter, which,
unhappily, we know remained without
effect, was found amongst Voltaire's
<pb n='695'/><anchor id='Pg695'/>
papers after his death. He,
on his side, strove to win over Hénault
to the <q>enlightened school,</q>
and with artful flattery and
subtlest sophistry urged him to
change certain historical passages
in the <hi rend='italic'>Abrégé Chronologique</hi> which
strongly vindicated the influence of
Christianity. But the Christian writer
withstood these blandishments.
In a literary point Voltaire contributed
in no small degree to the
reputation of Hénault, whose style
he praised with creditable candor.
It is strange to see the lively and
bored old <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>marquise</foreign> holding steadily
the friendship of these widely
dissimilar men. Diderot, D'Alembert,
and Montesquieu were also
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>habitués</foreign> of her brilliant <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salon</foreign>. But
none of them could do more than
give her momentary deliverance
from her life-long enemy&mdash;<foreign rend='italic'>ennui</foreign>.
She went on boring herself, in spite
of the perpetual cross-fire of <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>esprit</foreign>
that the brightest wits of the age
kept up around her, and she bored
her friends almost to exasperation
by the unceasing repetition of the
complaint: <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Que je m'ennuie! Que
je m'ennuie!</foreign>
</p>

<p>
At the age of fifty-four a terrible
misfortune befell the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>marquise</foreign>.
She grew blind. It was soon after
this that she became acquainted
with Mlle. de l'Espinasse. The
sprightliness and the energy of this
young girl were an immense consolation
to Mme. du Deffand, and
cheered her for a time in that
<q>eternal night,</q> as she pathetically
described it, in which she now
dwelt. But they did not agree for
long. After living happily together
for some few years, they
quarrelled and separated. It is
impossible to say whose fault it
was. Each had violent partisans,
who accused the other, but proved
nothing. Mme. du Deffand was
undoubtedly difficult to live with,
as all people are who draw exclusively
on those around them for
amusement; but she was old and
she was blind, and it is beyond
doubt she was a kind benefactress
to her young companion, and that,
at the moment of separation, she
wrote a most touching letter to her,
asking forgiveness for all she had
done inadvertently to pain her, and
urging the young girl to remember
how cruelly she was afflicted both
by blindness and by <foreign rend='italic'>ennui</foreign>. To
this Mlle. de l'Espinasse returned a
curt and ungracious answer. Nor
did she imitate the kindliness of
speech of her quondam employer,
who always spoke of her ever after
their quarrel with the utmost good-nature
and forbearance.
</p>

<p>
Just as her home was resounding
to these domestic discords, Mme.
du Deffand made the acquaintance
of Horace Walpole. They were
spontaneously pleased with each
other. Mme. du Deffand would
have probably been still more so,
if she could have foreseen how triumphantly
this new friendship was
destined to rescue her memory from
oblivion. We know more of her
and her <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salon</foreign> through the voluminous
correspondence that passed between
her and that prince of gossips
and most brilliant of scribblers
than through any other
source; although she comes in, it
is true, for more ridicule at his
hands than eulogy. He constantly
reproaches her for making him the
laughing-stock of Paris and London
by her absurd affection, and
coarsely tells her he does not want
to be the hero of a novel where the
heroine is a blind octogenarian.
</p>

<p>
This correspondence was published
at the beginning of the century,
and was hailed as a valuable
addition to the French literature
<pb n='696'/><anchor id='Pg696'/>
of that period. On reading it, one
feels transported into the society
of the fascinating women and accomplished
men whom it so cleverly
depicts. Mme. du Deffand passes
in review the authors and actors
of her time with a graphic power
of delineation rarely equalled.
Unsparing in her criticism, she is
in some instances no doubt too
severe, and occasionally even unjust;
it is nevertheless acknowledged
that in her literary judgments
she is rarely at fault; they are
marked throughout by discrimination,
taste, and delicacy.
</p>

<p>
Horace Walpole made Mme. du
Deffand's acquaintance when she
had become quite blind; on his
being presented to her, she drew
her hand over his face, in order to
ascertain whether he was plain or
handsome, and what his age was.
Her touch had acquired such sensitive
delicacy in course of time that
it enabled her to calculate people's
ages and looks with the greatest
accuracy. In quite the latter years
of her life Mme. du Deffand, who
had never been avowedly an unbeliever,
although practically so, turned
her thoughts to religion, and sought
in the teaching of the faith those
consolations to her <foreign rend='italic'>ennui</foreign> that wit
and philosophy had failed to secure
her. She announces this change
of sentiment, with her usual frankness,
in one of her letters to Walpole.
Her biographers throw but
little light on the subject. La
Harpe alludes to her having had
many interviews with the celebrated
Jesuit, F. Lenfant&mdash;an episode
which is dismissed by Mme. du
Deffand herself with the remark
that <q>the Père Lenfant was very
clever, and that she was much
pleased with him.</q>
</p>

<p>
The Père Lenfant who is thus incidentally
introduced to us in the
memoirs of the lively French woman
was one of the countless
noble and touching victims of the
Revolution&mdash;that raging torrent that
drowned so many gentle voices in
its roar. He was gifted with an
eloquence that drew around him
all the lovers of rhetoric and the
most able men of his day. The
poet Young heard him, and was
so struck by his power and pathos
that he entreated a Protestant
clergyman of his acquaintance to
go and hear him; the latter did
so, and embraced the faith. Once,
on coming out from a sermon of
the Père Lenfant's, preached at
S. Sulpice during Lent, Diderot exclaimed
to D'Alembert, who had
been drinking in every word from
beginning to end, with his eyes
riveted on the preacher: <q>It would
be hard to hear that man often
without becoming a Christian.</q>
</p>

<p>
When the order of the Jesuits
was disbanded in France, the Père
Lenfant was thrown upon the
world. He was then forty-seven
years of age. The decree which
despoiled him of his religious garb
could not rob him of its spirit.
He continued his good works and
his apostolate with fervor and wisdom.
Several crowned heads tried
to win him to their courts, but in
vain. The son of S. Ignatius held
steadily aloof from the tempting
snare. He preached indefatigably
at all times and places, at Lunéville,
Vienne, Versailles, wherever
he was called; and everywhere
the great and the learned flocked
round his pulpit. His contemporaries
describe the effects of his
eloquence as electrical. He captivated
his hearers, not so much
by the magnificence of his language,
as by the pathos of his
voice and the force of his own
faith. Père Lenfant preached the
<pb n='697'/><anchor id='Pg697'/>
Lent of 1791 before the court; but
on refusing to take the oath of the
clergy to the civil constitution, he
was obliged to withdraw. Shortly
afterwards he was taken prisoner
and condemned to death. On
being brought before his judges,
the people cried out that his life
might be spared, and, yielding to
the cries, his jailers let him go;
before, however, he had got free
from the crowd, a woman called
out: <q>There goes the king's confessor!</q>
At these words the thirst
for blood, that had seemed for
a moment satiated or suspended,
rose up anew. The mob set upon
him like tigers. The Père Lenfant
uttered only words of love and forgiveness,
and, raising his hands to
heaven, exclaimed: <q>My God, I
thank thee for allowing me to offer
my life for thee, as thou hast offered
thine for me!</q> And with this
gracious sentence on his lips the
Jesuit father fell and expired under
the blows of the murderers.
</p>

<p>
This little sketch of the Marquise
du Deffand would be incomplete
without a passing mention
of the author of the <hi rend='italic'>Esprit des
Lois</hi>, who was one of the most distinguished
of her numerous friends.
</p>

<p>
Her letters to Montesquieu have
been preserved; they are, however,
much less interesting than those
to Walpole, and consequently much
less known. Mme. du Deffand
could be a staunch friend, though
she was often a trying one; she
proved herself such to Montesquieu.
Amongst other good offices, she
cleared him from the charge of
avarice which was laid at his door
so generally. History revoked the
verdict, it is true, but only when the
subject of it was gone beyond the
reach of earthly rehabilitation.
Montesquieu's exceeding modesty
and desire to have his benefits known
only to the recipients was the real,
and perhaps the only, cause of his
reputed avarice. One example of his
delicate generosity we cannot refrain
from giving.
</p>

<p>
He was in the habit of visiting
Marseilles to see his sister, Mme.
d'Héricourt, who resided there.
During one of these visits he happened
one evening to be lounging
on the quay; the weather was sultry,
and it occurred to Montesquieu
that he would take a boat, and
have a row on the sea. His attention
was drawn to a young man who
was looking out for a customer.
He hailed him, and got in. As
soon as they were out a little at
sea, Montesquieu perceived that his
boatman was a novice at the work,
and rowed with difficulty. He
questioned him, and learned that
he was, in truth, a jeweller by trade,
and a boatman only on Sundays
and holidays, in order to gain a
trifle towards helping his mother
and sisters, who were working to
procure 4,000 crowns to ransom his
father, who was a prisoner at Tetuan.
Montesquieu was deeply touched
by the story. He made a resolution
on the spot, but said nothing. Before
landing, however, he got from
the boatman his father's name and
the name of his master. On parting,
he handed him his purse, and
walked away rapidly; great was
the delight of the young man, on
opening it, to find that it contained
sixteen golden <hi rend='italic'>louis</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Six weeks after this the captive
suddenly appeared in the midst of
his wife and children. He saw, by
the astonishment mingled with their
joy, that it was not to them he
owed his liberation; but the surprise
and gratitude of all were increased
on his telling them that
not only was his ransom paid, but
likewise his voyage home and his
<pb n='698'/><anchor id='Pg698'/>
clothing; and, over and above this,
a sum of fifty <hi rend='italic'>louis d'or</hi> had been
handed to him on starting. The
young boatman no sooner heard
this fairy tale than he bethought
him of the generous stranger who
had presented him the purse and
expressed such sympathy on hearing
of his sorrow. He determined
to seek him. For two years he did
so, but in vain. The name of the
benefactor to whom he and his
owed such a sweet and magnificent
debt of gratitude remained an impenetrable
mystery. At last one
day, while walking in the streets
of Paris, he suddenly encountered
Montesquieu face to face; the
young man fell upon his knees, kissed
the hand of his benefactor, and
entreated him to come with him to
the home he had blessed, and witness
the joy that he had brought
back to a desolate family. But
Montesquieu feigned ignorance
and surprise, declared he knew
nothing of what the young man
was talking about, and at last,
wrenching his hand away abruptly,
he disappeared in the crowd, nor
did his pursuer succeed in finding
him again.
</p>

<p>
This action would never have
been discovered had not Montesquieu's
executor found among his
papers a memorandum in his own
handwriting, stating that he had
sent 7,500 francs to Mr. Main, an
English banker at Cadiz; on the
latter being applied to for information,
he replied that he had given
that sum, by the order of M. de
Montesquieu, for the ransom of a
man named Robert, a Marseillais,
detained as a slave at Tetuan.
Inquiries were set on foot, and the
Robert family told the rest.
</p>

<p>
This touching incident was made
the foundation of many dramatic
pieces. If it did no more than
clear a noble character from the
unworthy charge of heartlessness
and avarice, the world would have
been the better for its discovery.

<head>Cain, What Hast Thou Done With Thy Brother?</head>

<p>
By Ernest Hello.
</p>

<p>
From The Revue Du Monde Catholique.
</p>

<p>
By way of preface, I will relate a
true story given by F. Agathon, a
priest of the Monastery of Ruba,
and preserved in the <hi rend='italic'>Lives of the
Fathers of the Desert</hi>.
</p>

<p>
F. Agathon says: <q rend='pre'>One day I
descended into the valley of Ruba
to find the holy solitary, F. Pémeu,
as I wished to consult him on a
subject that weighed heavily upon
my mind. We conversed until late
in the evening, and then he sent
me into a cavern to pass the rest
of the night. Now, as it was winter,
and the cold extreme, I was
nearly frozen. The next morning,
when the old man came in to see
me, he asked: <q>How have you
passed the night, my son?</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Father,</q> I answered, <q>I must
say, in truth, I passed a terrible
night, on account of the extraordinary
severity of the cold.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>And I did not feel it at all,</q>
he replied.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>These words filled me with astonishment,
<pb n='699'/><anchor id='Pg699'/>
as he was nearly naked,
and I said: <q>I beg of you, father,
to tell me how that could have happened.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>For the reason,</q> he answered,
<q>that a lion came and lay down
beside me, and kept me warm.
But nevertheless, my dear son, I
can assure you that I shall be devoured
by wild beasts.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Why do you say so?</q> I asked.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><q>Because,</q> he replied, <q>when I
was a shepherd in our country (we
were both from Galatia), I would
have saved the life of a traveller,
if I had accompanied him; but I
did not show him that charity, and
he was devoured by the dogs.
Therefore I shall most certainly
meet with a similar death.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And it really happened as he
said. For three years afterwards
he was torn to pieces by wild
beasts.</q>
</p>

<div>
<head>I.</head>

<p>
Dear Marie, cease to think of
me; all is ended; I am lost. I do
not tell you what will become of
me; I know nothing myself. I only
know that yesterday I received the
fatal blow, from which I cannot recover.
</p>

<p>
I had just finished the last picture,
of which I have so often spoke
to you&mdash;The First Glance. It is
the portrait of a young man, who
awakens and looks around him, as
though he saw everything for the
first time.
</p>

<p>
Some of my friends thought the
picture splendid, but added that it
would not sell well, as my name
was unknown to the public.
</p>

<p>
After innumerable attempts, all
equally unfortunate, I showed it
yesterday to a very rich amateur&mdash;Baron
de Brienne. He examined
the picture, thought it remarkable,
and then asked if I had often exhibited
my pictures.
</p>

<p>
On my replying in the negative,
his expression changed.
</p>

<p>
<q>I thought,</q> said he, <q>I did not
know your name. You must make
yourself known. This picture has
great merit, and this sketch also,</q>
he added, throwing a rapid glance
at my other picture just commenced&mdash;you
know it, Marie&mdash;Cain after
his Crime&mdash;<q>but, in fact, you are
not known,</q> he concluded.
</p>

<p>
<q>But, sir,</q> I replied, <q>I am endeavoring
to make myself known.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well,</q> continued the baron,
<q>you have talent, that I acknowledge;
but I doubt if it is the kind
of talent that will be appreciated
by the public. If I bought your
picture, I would be asked where I
found it. As it stands there, it has
a certain value; but if you were
dead, it would be worth a hundred
times as much, and perhaps would
soon find purchasers, possibly myself
among the first. You see I
can't change the world. So it is
with men; they will pay the most
ridiculous price for objects of art
whose worth is guaranteed by a
signature, but will not bother themselves
to talk up unknown talent.
I,</q> he added with a happy smile,
<q>recently gave a hundred thousand
francs for a picture which I do not
place above yours; but it was a
Murillo! I am a modest man, and
always side with the majority. The
majority is always right, and, for
my part, I am not vain enough to
think I know more than the entire
human race. Make yourself known;
everything is in that. Make yourself
known; put your pictures in the
exhibition; receive medals and decorations.
But, above all, die; your
pictures then will be worth so much
gold. You see you are talking to a
practical man, who don't believe in
<pb n='700'/><anchor id='Pg700'/>
neglected genius. <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Au revoir</foreign>, monsieur.
You really have talent; more
even than that, I do not hesitate to
say you have genius. <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Au revoir</foreign>.</q>
</p>

<p>
This, Marie, was my last adventure.
All the others were similar. I
will spare you any further details.
I have told you in a few words what
in reality was a long agony. But
despair is brief; it has not the courage
to dwell on separate facts; it
sums up the causes, and only shows
the effects.
</p>

<p>
Now, my dear Marie, you know
what happened yesterday. The
day before there came another
gentleman, who had not the time to
examine my picture as it deserved.
This he explained to me for two
hours without looking at the picture.
He really had no time; for example,
every morning he visits his
stables from ten to twelve, and in
the afternoon rows on the lake from
four to six.
</p>

<p>
As for Baron de Brienne, when
he left, he assured me he held my
talent in the highest estimation;
that he would like to have a gallery
of pictures all painted by me, as it
would probably one day be very
valuable; later, my pictures would
sell splendidly, and he could make
money by the operation.
</p>

<p>
If there is ever to be a later day
for me, I shall find him, when I will
no longer need him, and he will be
the first to show me honor.
</p>

<p>
Adieu, Marie. I was so sanguine,
so buoyed up with hope, it needed
all this time&mdash;all this precious time,
of which these gentlemen had so
little to waste&mdash;to bring me where I
am now.
</p>

<p>
I think the baron saw despair in
my face, for he used a singular expression
on leaving which I had
not provoked by any remark.
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear sir, do not look so
dismal and wretched. I am not
the Don Quixote of budding genius.
Make yourself known, make
yourself known, and you will find
me! But if your courage fails, you
will commit blunders and spoil your
talent, for which I will not be responsible;
like Pilate, I wash my
hands of you!</q>
</p>

<p>
I listened to them going down
the stairs.
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no,</q> said he to his wife;
<q>you see for my portrait I must
have a master, a signature.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps,</q> replied the baroness&mdash;<q>perhaps
we have done wrong to
discourage the young man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Discourage? What are you
talking about? I told him he had
great talent. Do you wish to know
what I think?</q> he added, as he stood
for an instant before her. <q>What
ruins art in the present day is that
it is gorged with gold, and that too
few men of genius die in the hospital&mdash;that
is the reason!</q>
</p>

<p>
Adieu, Marie.
</p>

<milestone unit='tb'/>

<p>
Something else was said, which
Paul did not hear.
</p>

<p>
The baroness paused, as she was
about to enter the carriage.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, what is the matter with
you?</q> said her husband.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am not very well,</q> she replied.
</p>

<p>
<q>So much more reason for getting
in the carriage. What ails
you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The face of that young man
haunts me. Who knows what despair
may drive him to? Who
knows how terrible may be his hidden
suffering? Let us go back. I
feel as though we had just committed
a crime. Let us go back. Thirty
years ago I read a story which I
had long forgotten, but that now
returns vaguely to my memory as
a warning. I no longer remember
<pb n='701'/><anchor id='Pg701'/>
the whole, but the impression comes
back vague and terrible after thirty
years. Ah! let us go back.</q>
</p>

<p>
The baron stopped, and laughed
immensely.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ha! ha! Are you crazy?
Haven't I the <emph>right</emph> to choose the
pictures I wish to buy? Is there a
law which compels me to buy pictures
from this gentleman? I speak
to you very seriously, my dear;
such fancies as these will make
you crazy. There is a great deal
of insanity in our present day. Let
us take care, let us take care!</q>
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>II.</head>

<p>
Marie, after reading her brother's
letter, was half frantic with terror,
as she knew him thoroughly, and
understood his bitter despair. She
lost no time, but left in the first
train. Arrived in Paris, she ran to
the little house in the Quartier Latin
where Paul lived. She was too excited
to take a carriage. The rapid
walk seemed to soothe her. In the
cars she longed for quicker movement;
in the street she wished for
wings; at the door she would rather
have been at the other end of
the world. She dared not go up.
She stopped, suffocated with the
beating of her heart. If it was already
too late&mdash;the thought nearly
paralyzed her with horror. If she
were a minute too late!
</p>

<p>
Finally, when on the stairs, she
wept. Then she dared ring.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have wept,</q> she thought; <q>he
is saved.</q> Taught by a long and singular
experience, the young girl
knew that tears were for her the mysterious
and certain sign that her
prayer was granted. She rang. A servant-girl,
without speaking, led her
to a bed, and uttered a single word&mdash;<q>Dead</q>&mdash;and
then added: <q>The
funeral will take place in two hours.
He threw himself into the Seine
from the bridge of Austerlitz.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is not dead,</q> said Marie.
</p>

<p>
<q>The registration of the death
has been made,</q> said the woman.
</p>

<p>
Without replying, Marie looked
fixedly at him, and said to herself:
</p>

<p>
<q>He is not dead. I have wept;
he is not dead. Paul!</q> she called.
Silence. <q>Paul!</q> Silence.
</p>

<p>
She seized a mirror, and held it
to her brother's lips. At the moment
she took it in her hand she
burst into tears. <q>You will see
that he is saved!</q> she said.
</p>

<p>
The woman thought her crazy.
Marie still held the mirror before
Paul's lips. Dead silence; her own
poor heart nearly stopped&mdash;the
mirror was tarnished!
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>III.</head>

<p>
Seven years afterwards M. le
Baron de Brienne was conversing
in a numerous and choice circle.
It was at a grand dinner. The women
were crowned with flowers
and sparkling with jewels. The
conversation turned upon a great
crime which had recently been
committed, the details of which
filled two columns of every paper.
Suddenly the Baron de Brienne
became singularly agitated, and
then, in a voice which he endeavored
to keep calm, but whose trembling
was still further shown by
the effort to subdue it, said:
</p>

<p>
<q>It appears that the police have
not yet discovered any trace of the
assassin.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know,</q> replied a guest.
</p>

<p>
<q>I believe not,</q> said another.
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me,</q> replied a third
person; <q>according to the latest accounts,
the police, if not positively
sure, had at least great hopes.</q>
</p>

<p>
The Baron de Brienne was as
white as his napkin. He tried to
<pb n='702'/><anchor id='Pg702'/>
overcome and conceal his excitement,
and attempted to eat; but
the effort was too great. He
swooned, and fell heavily to the
ground.
</p>

<p>
Every one rose and crowded
around him. Water was thrown in
his face, salts were held for him to
inhale. The hostess neglected none
of the ceremonies usual in such
cases. Fortunately, there was a
physician among the guests. Every
attention was lavished upon M. le
Baron. His carriage was called, and
he was taken home.
</p>

<p>
The next day he was better; at
the end of three days he was well.
He made them bring any quantity
of papers, and read them to him.
Mme. la Baronne, who was the
reader, suddenly paused, and said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Here is more of the horrid
crime of which we were all talking
when you were taken ill.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well?</q> said the baron in a
singular tone.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well,</q> continued the baroness,
<q>the murderer has been arrested.
But what a strange interest you take
in the affair!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I?</q> replied the baron. <q>Oh! not
at all; I can very truly say that. Why
do you think otherwise?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Because you are so strangely
excited whenever the subject is
mentioned.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean, talking
about my excitement?</q> he replied.
<q>Can you possibly imagine, like
those stupid people at dinner the
other evening, that this affair interests
me in the slightest degree?
They were all there looking at me,
looking at me ... with eyes ...
with eyes.... Are you, too, going
to stare at me now with those
eyes ... with those eyes....</q>
</p>

<p>
Mme. la Baronne rose, and wrote
two lines: <q><hi rend='italic'>Dear doctor, come instantly.</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Carry that to the telegraph
office,</q> she said to the servant.
</p>

<p>
<q>She did not count the words,</q>
muttered the man in astonishment,
as he withdrew. <q>It must be something
very serious.</q>
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>IV.</head>

<p>
Three months had elapsed, and
the baron had resumed his ordinary
life, when one evening, in a <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salon</foreign>
in the faubourg Saint-Honoré, a
gentleman remarked, in the course
of conversation, that it was astonishing
the number of crimes one daily
heard of. And he related the last
murder that the daily paper had
brought under his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Said the baron: <q>Why do you
make such an assertion? Never
were crimes so rare as to-day;
manners and customs are so much
softened, we can almost say there
are no longer any criminals. None
can be found in the higher class of
society; and when we speak of the
aristocracy, it means the entire
nation. Indeed, to speak the truth,
I believe very little in the wonderful
crimes with which the daily
journals fill their columns when
there is a dearth of political news.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are very incredulous, M. le
Baron,</q> replied the Comte de Sartigny.
<q>Probably it is from kindness
to the editors that the police seek
the criminals, and the courts judge
them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You say,</q> answered the baron,
<q>that the police seek the criminals.
It is false, M. le Comte. In the
first place, only one is guilty, and
the police are not hunting him up;
he is already found, and he has no
accomplice. He has been found,
I tell you, he has been found; and
the man has no accomplice. Perhaps
I don't know it. Ha! ha!</q>
</p>

<p>
While the baron, pale as death,
<pb n='703'/><anchor id='Pg703'/>
spoke these words, with terror imprinted
on his face, the count looked
steadily at him, and said:
</p>

<p>
<q>You say that I have spoken
falsely, M. le Baron? Will you
repeat that remark? I think those
were your words, but perhaps I
was mistaken.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I only say one thing,</q> replied
the baron, <q>which is, that the criminal
has been found and arrested.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But a moment ago you denied
the reality of the crime.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I only say one thing, M. le
Comte: that there is no doubt
about the name of the assassin.</q>
</p>

<p>
The master of the house took
the count by the arm, and led him
to the recess of a window....
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! very well, very well; I did
not know it,</q> said the count, as he
left the room.
</p>

<p>
While they were conversing together,
the baron made several
vain efforts to rise. He experienced
the supreme anguish of a man who,
while still in the possession of his
faculties, feels they are leaving him&mdash;of
a man who has not fainted, but
who is about to faint, and who feels
on his brow the first drops of cold
sweat.
</p>

<p>
The baroness made her excuses
for leaving so early, and, when alone
with her husband, asked anxiously:
</p>

<p>
<q>What can be the matter with
you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you too, you too,</q> he replied,
pushing her from him, as he
raised his blood-shot eyes.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>V.</head>

<p>
<q>We must,</q> said the doctor,
<q>enter into his mania, so as to endeavor
to discover the cause. We
must make him talk without questioning
him. Do you know, madame,
in the life of M. le Baron,
of any fact that may have left a
disagreeable remembrance?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Doctor, do you mean a guilty
remembrance?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, madame; something terrifying.</q>
</p>

<p>
The baroness thought a long
while.
</p>

<p>
<q>No,</q> said she, <q>not one. Our
life has always passed most tranquilly.
You know how people of the
world live; well, so we live, and
have always lived. My husband is
a quiet man, who has never had a
quarrel in his life with any one, and
has never done an injury that I
know of.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You have never seen in the baron
any anxiety of conscience?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Any anxiety of conscience?
He? Why should he have any?
He has never in his life done anything
to reproach himself with.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The baron,</q> replied the doctor,
<q>has the reputation of being benevolent
and kind-hearted. I don't
think he is naturally very imaginative;
do you, madame?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all, doctor. I think he is
just the contrary. I can even say
he has very little faith.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But when and where did you
first perceive the commencement of
this mania?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was one day when nothing
strange had happened. Some one
had been speaking of a young sculptor,
who now is very famous. A
friend told us that he owed his success
to a rich banker, who had discovered
his talents by some happy
accident, and had aided him with
his fortune and influence. When
our guests had left, and we were
alone, I thought he would kill himself;
as now, without the slightest
reason.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In his daily life does he show
any eccentricity of which I am yet
ignorant?</q>
</p>

<pb n='704'/><anchor id='Pg704'/>

<p>
<q>Not precisely eccentricity,</q>
said Mme. de Brienne. <q>His tastes
have changed very much, but that
cannot be called eccentricity. He
formerly spent quite a fortune in
purchasing pictures, of which he
has a very fine collection, that he
admired extravagantly; now he
never looks at them. But he has
always been rather fickle.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Does he talk in his sleep?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No; but one morning (now
that you make me think of it)
he awoke terribly frightened at a
dream. <q>Ah! what a dream I have
had,</q> he said to me. His face looked
worn and haggard, and, as I begged
him to relate it, he turned away his
eyes, and refused peremptorily. I
insisted, but he kept silent, and I
have never been able to make him
relate it.</q>
</p>

<p>
The doctor reflected.
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps that is the whole secret,</q>
said he. <q>But if we were
to ask him about it now, probably
to-morrow we would be obliged to
confine him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Confine him?</q> cried the baroness.
<q>Do you think him so seriously
affected?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very seriously, madame, and
more so as he is perfectly sane in
relation to other affairs. His mania
is confined to one point, and is
what we call hallucination. My
duty compels me to tell you, madame,
that it is a case where science
up to the present time has been
very unsuccessful.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, doctor, never was there a
man less crazy. As for the pictures,
which was the only passion I
ever knew him to have, he prided
himself on never having done a
foolish thing; he only bought pictures
of known value, with the signatures
of the artists fully guaranteed.
I, for instance, who am
speaking to you, would have sometimes
acted more unwisely than
he. I remember once he even refused....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nevertheless,</q> interrupted the
doctor, <q>the case is very serious.</q>
</p>

<p>
The baron was alone in his
room. His wife listened attentively
at the door, and watched him
through the key-hole. He raised
the curtains, shook the cushions on
the sofa, searched around, and,
when convinced that he was alone,
spoke in a low voice; but his wife
caught his words.
</p>

<p>
<q>No one suspects me. No one,
not even she; and yet everything
should warn them, everything....
The circumstances that accompanied
the act are reproduced every
instant. For example, the clouds
in the sky have nearly always the
same form as at that moment....
The clouds do it purposely; they
have assumed since that day certain
positions always the same.
What do they resemble? What I
do not wish to say, but I know
well since my dream. Oh! that
dream.... I am cold, frozen.
Why is it no one ever speaks to
me of that dream; that no one in
this house remembers it? And
yet they were all there ... in the
dream.... My wife was there,
and the other one also,</q> he added,
lowering his voice.
</p>

<p>
And after a silence, occasionally
broken by unintelligible words, and
joined to a strange pantomime, he
continued:
</p>

<p>
<q>It was frightful. How that man
struggled for his life!</q>
</p>

<p>
And speaking always lower and
lower, the baron gasped out:
</p>

<p>
<q>He clung to me, and, when I
pushed him into the water, an expression
passed over his face such
as was never seen but then in this
world. It was near the bridge of
Austerlitz. How he glared at me
<pb n='705'/><anchor id='Pg705'/>
as he disappeared the last time!
How is it that in the street the
passers-by do not say on seeing
me, <q>There is the man, there he
is&mdash;the man who had the dream</q>?
But was it a dream or reality?
Men often pass me quickly in the
street. Who knows but that they
know or see something?</q>
</p>

<p>
The baron walked around the
room, greatly excited, and then,
pausing, he sighed, and said in a
mournful tone:
</p>

<p>
<q>How do other men act&mdash;those
who are not followed? They can
take a step without hearing behind
them another step that goes quicker
or slower, according as they walk.
Then there are men who do not
hear steps behind them as they
walk. Yet I always seek the
noisiest places; but no noise ever
deadens the sound of that step, so
faint but so invincible. The noise
of carriages, the roar of cannon&mdash;I
have tried everything.... If possible
I would live amidst thunder;
but the lightning might fall near
me, and cover me with ruins; still
should I hear that faint, almost imperceptible
noise, a foot that just
touches the ground. I am cold!
How cold it is! Fire no longer
warms me! How lightly that foot
touches the ground. It does not
press heavily like ours. No, decidedly
not; it was no dream&mdash;it
was reality. That foot never is
tired; but when I stop, it stops. It
has a certain manner of stopping
that makes me always feel that it is
there, and that it will resume its
walk when I do mine. Sometimes
I would rather hear it, and I walk
to make it walk; when it is silent,
its menace is to me more terrible
than the sound of the step.... If
it would only change place!...
But, no; always at an equal distance
from me. Ah! how cruel. If I
could but see some one, I think
the most horrible spectacle would
be less terrifying than this dreary
void. To hear and not see!</q>
</p>

<p>
Here the baron rapidly jumped
backwards, and put out his hand as
though to grasp something in the
air, then exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
<q>Gone! He has escaped&mdash;escaped,
as ever!</q>
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>VI.</head>

<p>
The course of the baron's ordinary
life flowed on as smoothly as
ever. Nothing was changed, and
those who were not much with
him perceived no difference; to
them he was the same as heretofore.
</p>

<p>
The following summer he wished
to go to the sea-shore.
</p>

<p>
They left for Brittany. They
spoke of the pleasant walks and
drives, and the baron, in an absent
manner, asked on which part of the
coast was the most sand. He would
not hear of the cliffs; he wanted
sand&mdash;only sand. Gâvre was recommended
by a gentleman who
was seated near them at the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>table
d'hôte</foreign>.
</p>

<p>
The baron instantly decided upon
going to Gâvre.
</p>

<p>
<q>At what hour shall we leave?</q>
asked the baroness.
</p>

<p>
The <emph>we</emph> evidently displeased the
baron. He wished to go alone. He
gave a thousand pretexts to prevent
his wife accompanying him. As
she would not admit them, he said,
contrary to his usual custom, <q>I
will</q> ... <q>I wish to go alone,</q>
said he. <q>Am I in prison? Do
you take me for a criminal?</q>
</p>

<p>
The baron left Port Louis in the
steamboat. His wife followed him,
without being seen, on another
boat, and watched his movements
through a spy-glass, as he paced up
and down the shore at Gâvre.
</p>

<pb n='706'/><anchor id='Pg706'/>

<p>
First, according to his usual custom,
he assured himself that he was
alone. Then he would take several
steps, and return quickly, seeing
nothing; he searched in the sand,
and, finding his own footsteps, he
sought a little further on the trace
of the <emph>other</emph> one. All in vain. Disappointed,
he went to another spot,
and recommenced his weary walk,
always seeing his own footprints,
never the <emph>other</emph>. He had hoped
in the sand; the sand had proved
false, as everything else.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>VII.</head>

<p>
Meanwhile, the doctor was in
Paris, and one evening in a <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salon</foreign> in
the faubourg Saint Germain. The
conversation was on madness; and
the doctor, who was a celebrated
<foreign rend='italic'>alieniste</foreign>, was asked many questions
as to the causes of insanity.
</p>

<p>
<q>The causes of insanity,</q> said
he, <q>are so profound and mysterious
that to know them one must
make the tour of the invisible
world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have known,</q> said one gentleman,
<q>insane persons who
thought themselves guilty of crimes
which they had never committed&mdash;innocent
men, intelligent and good,
incapable of harming a bird, and
who thought themselves assassins.</q>
</p>

<p>
Among the guests that evening
was a famous artist, M. Paul Bayard,
whose most admired works,
The First Glance, and Cain after
his Crime, ranked with the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>chefs-d'œuvre</foreign>
of the greatest masters of
the day.
</p>

<p>
Said M. Bayard: <q rend='pre'>I have not
studied, like you, doctor, from life.
I don't know any insane persons,
and what I am going to tell you is
not founded on fact. But this is
what I think about this strange remorse
felt by innocent people:
who knows if they may not have
committed <emph>spiritually</emph> the crime of
which they think themselves guilty
<emph>materially</emph>? In this hypothesis
they have completely forgotten the
real and spiritual crime, which they
committed really and spiritually;
they did not even know or feel it
at the instant they committed it.
But this crime real, spiritual, and
forgotten is transformed, by virtue
of madness, into a material crime,
of which they are innocent, but of
which they believe themselves guilty.
Perhaps a man has betrayed
his friend; instead of accusing himself
of this treason, he accuses himself
of another fault which resembles
that one, as the body resembles
the soul. I repeat, I cannot
cite an example. It is purely hypothetical;
but something which I
cannot define makes me think it
possible, nay, even probable. The
guilty person deceived his conscience;
conscience in turn deceives
him. To make a child understand,
we give examples of sensible things.
Perhaps justice thus acts with these
men, and, finding them insensible
in the sphere of the mind, transports
their crime into the sphere
of the body.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps it is a real crime, but
too subtle to be understood by
them, that descends to their level,
and pursues them under the appearance
of an external and sensible
crime, the only one which they can
understand. There are whimsical
scruples which resemble madness,
as exaggeration resembles falsehood.
Who knows if these scruples are
not the wanderings, or, if you prefer
it, the transpositions of remorse?
I say <hi rend='italic'>remorse</hi>. I do not say repentance,
for repentance enlightens, and
remorse blinds. Between repentance
and remorse there is an abyss:
the first gives peace, the second destroys
<pb n='707'/><anchor id='Pg707'/>
it. Perhaps conscience, not
being able to make itself felt by the
guilty person on its own ground,
speaks to him, by way of revenge, in
language as coarse as himself, on
his own domain. Through a terrible
justice, it makes him reproach
himself with what appears unjust
on the surface, but which is a thousand
times just at the bottom.
Conscience, which spoke in vain at
the moment of the crime, now arms
itself against the criminal as a
phantom. We are men here to-night,
as we appear to each other;
but who knows if we are not for
some one somewhere, at this moment,
phantoms?</q>
</p>

<p>
The doctor rose, and, taking the
artist's hand, said: <q>I do not know
how much truth there may be in
your theory. I only know one
thing: that you are a man of genius,
and, if I had doubted it before,
I am now convinced of it. I will
reflect on your words; they open to
me a new horizon.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have always been pursued by
the thought,</q> said the artist, <q>that
there is a moment when a man understands
for the first time what
he has seen since his infancy. It
is the day when the eyes of the
mind open. It is this I have attempted
to show in my picture&mdash;The
First Glance. But as the
horizon is constantly enlarging, I
endeavor to throw upon everything,
each time, a look which
I may call The First Glance.
In the other composition, Cain
after his Crime, I wished to show
in Cain, not the melodramatic assassin,
but a vulgar, common man.
The <hi rend='italic'>stigmata</hi> of anger, of which he
received the visible mark, opens
to him the eyes of the soul. He
throws upon his crime a first glance.
There are spiritual Cains whose
arms are innocent. Perhaps there
may be some among the insane, of
whom we have spoken; and in that
case there is more truth in their
madness than in their previous
security. Their insanity only deceives
them about the nature of the
crime; their security deceived them
about the crime itself.</q>
</p>

<p>
The doctor was thoughtful. He
took the artist aside, and in a low
tone said: <q>Shall we leave together?</q>
And they left.
</p>

<p>
After their departure the conversation
turned on what had just
been said.
</p>

<p>
<q>Were you always a materialist?</q>
asked one person of his neighbor.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is scarcely fair or generous
to choose this moment for such a
question,</q> was the reply.
</p>

<p>
<q>As for me,</q> said a young lady,
<q>I don't like to hear M. Bayard
talk. He is a great artist&mdash;that I
admit; but when he commences in
that style, he worries me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Would it be indiscreet, madame,
to ask you why?</q> timidly inquired
a young man with a badly-tied cravat.
</p>

<p>
<q>Because I am afraid he is right
in his opinions. I wish to pass
gaily through life; and if we believe
what he says, life would be such a
serious affair, we should have to
think. Really, to hear him, we can
imagine ourselves surrounded with
mysteries.</q>
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>VIII.</head>

<p>
<q>I wish to see and study your
picture of Cain. I was going to say
your portrait of Cain,</q> said the
doctor to the painter; <q>for it
seems to me that you must have
known him personally, from the
manner in which you have spoken
to me of him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps I have known him,</q>
<pb n='708'/><anchor id='Pg708'/>
said Paul. <q>At any rate, come!</q>
And they entered the studio.
</p>

<p>
Arrived before the picture, the
doctor started back in surprise.
</p>

<p>
The portrait of Cain was that of
the baron, horrible in the resemblance.
</p>

<p>
There was on that face the coldness
of the criminal and the horror
of the cursed. The coldness did not
impair the horror, nor the horror
the coldness; and from the mouth
of Cain the spectator might expect
to hear the words that S. Bridget
heard from the mouth of Satan
when he said to God:
</p>

<p>
<q>O Judge! I am coldness itself.</q>
</p>

<p>
Indifference and despair were in
those eyes, on those lips, and on
that brow. But the despair was
not heartrending, for repentance
was wanting, and this despair even
appeared expiatory, like justice eating
its bread.
</p>

<p>
The doctor remained a long
while motionless. The horizon opened
before his eyes. His science
sought new depths. He did not
precisely reflect, but he remembered,
and, perhaps for the first
time in his life, passed an hour in
profound contemplation.
</p>

<p>
<q>So you know him?</q> said he at
last to Paul.
</p>

<p>
<q>Whom do you mean?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, my patient!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't know any of your
patients.</q>
</p>

<p>
Professional discretion arrested
the name before it passed the doctor's
lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>But, really,</q> said he, <q>this
head is a portrait. You could not
have drawn it by chance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Neither one nor the other,</q> replied
Paul. <q rend='pre'>No one sat for me, and I
did not draw it by chance. It appears
to me, when I work, certain faces are
offered to me without forcing themselves
upon me. I perceive them
interiorly; for my eyes are closed
and I see nothing. Perceive is not
the proper word, for the sense of
sight is not needed. If I perceive
them, it is with an unknown sense
which is not that of sight, and in a
peculiar condition, in comparison
with which wakefulness is profound
sleep. I think these perceptions
correspond with some reality,
either distant or future, whose photographic
likeness at that moment
passes before the eyes of the
mind.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>This faculty, which may be called
natural inspiration, has never
abandoned me. The aptitude to
surmise what I do not know is the
highest form of the activity of my
mind, and not only do I surmise
what I do not know, but very often
I do it, I realize it, without intention
and without knowledge. It is
as though I were an actor in a
drama of which I was ignorant. I
recite a part in a play that I do not
know, and whose title and plot are
equally unknown.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yet I feel myself free, and the
profound sentiment of my liberty
bursts forth, above all, in the remembrance
of my faults. I wished
to die, but death did not want me.
I have sometimes asked myself if,
having wished to lose my life, I
might not lose inspiration, which
would be for me a subtle and
cruel manner of death. It has
seemed to me that the question has
been agitated somewhere, and that
inspiration, which has compassion
on the weak, came back to me
gratuitously. If I had been criminal
from malice, it would have
abandoned me, perhaps, or have
become in me the auxiliary of a
future crime. It might have refused
to help me, or have assisted
me in doing wrong.</q>
</p>

</div>

<pb n='709'/><anchor id='Pg709'/>

<div>
<head>IX.</head>

<p>
Shortly after this interview the
baron returned to Paris, apparently
calmer than usual.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is much better,</q> said Mme.
la Baronne. <q>The doctor alarmed
me terribly; but I knew very well
in reality there was no danger. My
husband is a cold man, and I have
nothing to fear for his reason.</q>
</p>

<p>
The following night the baron
waited until the house was quiet,
and then went on tiptoe, as though
afraid of being surprised or disturbed.
Once safely in his picture
gallery, he cut each of the pictures
with a penknife, and then one by
one burst them open by placing
his knee against the canvas; and,
that accomplished, left the house
toward morning. The porter saw
him pass, but did not recognize
him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is that old man,</q> said he
to his wife, <q>who passed the night
in the house?</q>
</p>

<p>
The baron's hair, black the night
before, was white as snow.
</p>

<p>
They waited for him at breakfast,
they waited for him at dinner;
he did not return. In searching
his papers his wife found a note
containing these words:
</p>

<p>
<q>This time I will not escape; the
police are on my track.</q>
</p>

<p>
Said madame: <q>I always feared
some misfortune would happen to
me.</q>
</p>

<p>
The next day the baron's body
was found in the Seine under the
bridge of Austerlitz.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am much distressed, but not
astonished,</q> said the doctor to madame.
<q>I always thought his madness
absolutely incurable.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! doctor, he destroyed all
the pictures. I have not even his
portrait.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You shall have it, madame,</q>
said the doctor.
</p>

<p>
Eight days afterwards the doctor
kept his promise. He brought
the baroness a photograph.
</p>

<p>
Madame de Brienne was profoundly
agitated, and nearly fainted.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! what a resemblance,</q> she
gasped, <q>what a resemblance! Doctor,
how was it done? This is not
natural. It is not his portrait, it is
himself. He is going to speak. I
am afraid!</q>
</p>

<p>
There was horror in the astonishment
of the poor woman. She
threw upon her husband and herself
a first glance.
</p>

<p>
<q>But tell me, doctor, where did
you find it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Allow me to keep the secret,
madame.</q>
</p>

<p>
In reality, the thing was very
simple: they had only photographed
the picture of the great artist&mdash;Cain
after his Crime.

<head>The Legend Of Vallambrosa.</head>

<lg>
<l>An ancient myth like ivied vesture clings</l>
<l>About fair Vallambrosa's cloistered walls,</l>
<l>Telling that 'neath the roof sweet charity</l>
<l>Has spread her soft, warm draperies within</l>
<l>What time eight circling centuries have traced,</l>
<l>In memories gray and green, her blessedness.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Of the fair, nestling valley here to sing,</l>
<l>With sweet-strung choice of cadenced synonymes,</l>
<l>Could better music hold the ear, to note</l>
<l>Its silver-dropping streams and shadowy dells</l>
<l>Than that wherewith Italia christened it,</l>
<l>Calling it <hi rend='italic'>Aqua-Bella</hi>, or the <hi rend='italic'>Val-Ambrosa</hi>, liquid-toned and clear? No ripple,</l>
<l>Methinks, of happier tones or tenderer hues</l>
<l>Could voice its lapsing falls and verdant vales</l>
<l>Than lives within such naming!</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 10'>Hither came</l>
<l>Long years agone&mdash;long years before the years</l>
<l>That gave the legend birth&mdash;a prayerful priest,</l>
<l>Bearing the cross where untamed beast and bird,</l>
<l>Alone frequenting, poured in wildest notes</l>
<l>The praise for life which lowest life uplifts!</l>
<l>And here, as ever, man's triumphant voice</l>
<l>Leaped up above the brute's, beseeching heaven</l>
<l>To consecrate with holy dews, and bless,</l>
<l>The heights which, cycles later, cradling held</l>
<l>The hermitage of one so famed; and grew,</l>
<l>As seed luxuriant in rich soil <emph>will</emph> grow,</l>
<l>Because all teeming life must needs expand,</l>
<l>These walls of generous hospice that outstretch</l>
<l>Their sheltering arms to weary travellers.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>If it be true, as we have often heard,</l>
<l>That lukewarm sinners make but lukewarm saints,</l>
<l>Perhaps the converse proof we hold in hand;</l>
<l>For, mark! once lived in Florence, of the proud</l>
<l>Gualberto house, one heir to all its pride,</l>
<l>Giovanni named&mdash;<emph>he</emph> this same sinner-saint.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Quickened by summers of some eighteen years,</l>
<l>And flushed by southern suns to fervid warmth</l>
<pb n='711'/><anchor id='Pg711'/>
<l>Of life impetuous, his youthful form</l>
<l>Bore stamp already of the venturous will</l>
<l>Of a gay, dashing cavalier outgiven</l>
<l>To heedless coursings in the round of sense.</l>
<l>And yet there dwelt adeep within his breast</l>
<l>A living well of tenderness that flowed</l>
<l>In gentle care for Hubert, his beloved</l>
<l>And only brother.</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 10'>Hubert (a twelvemonth</l>
<l>Scarce younger) stood between his tempted soul</l>
<l>And much that might have swayed it past recall</l>
<l>Over the margin of sin's dread abyss.</l>
<l>'Twas not that Hubert was a chastened saint,</l>
<l>But love within the brother's ardent soul</l>
<l>Invested him with raiment pure and white&mdash;</l>
<l>Love holding from assoil the fabric fine</l>
<l>Itself had wove, and still will choose to weave</l>
<l>So long as life is life, or love is love.</l>
<l>Thus, when unto Giovanni came a dawn</l>
<l>That kindled to a conscious glow of health</l>
<l>His own quick pulse, yet, warming, failed to melt</l>
<l>The frozen current in pale Hubert's veins,</l>
<l>Because those veins had felt the frigid touch</l>
<l>Of steel in duelling combat, there arose</l>
<l>Within his anguished heart a stern demand</l>
<l>Against the murderer of life for life&mdash;</l>
<l>An unrelenting thirst of blood, to quell</l>
<l>The ghostly phantoms of his fevered brain,</l>
<l>And satisfy with feast of sweet revenge</l>
<l>His brother's manes.</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 10'>On one Good-Friday morn,</l>
<l>Followed by armed retainers, and slow bent</l>
<l>Unto San Miniato to attend</l>
<l>High Mass, in faithfulness to Hubert's soul,</l>
<l>He met unwittingly within a pass</l>
<l>That leads to the Basilica this man,</l>
<l>Of all men hated most. Close, face to face,</l>
<l>Spell-bound they stood a moment's span; then flashed</l>
<l>From out Giovanni's sheath his gleaming sword,</l>
<l>And by its glittering sign with one will rose</l>
<l>From every trusty scabbard near at hand</l>
<l>Sharp kindred swords that gleamed defiant fire</l>
<l>Into the bright'ning day, and in <emph>his</emph> face</l>
<l>Who stood unarmed, alone.</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 10'>The unsheathed sword</l>
<l>Of pitiless Giovanni had well-nigh</l>
<l>Its rueful deed of deadly wrath made sure</l>
<l>When he, the helpless foe confronted thus</l>
<l>By certain death, saw in death's pallid light</l>
<l>The spectre of his sin as it must seem</l>
<pb n='712'/><anchor id='Pg712'/>
<l>To disembodied spirits, and he fell</l>
<l>Prone, horror-stricken, at the avenger's feet.</l>
<l>There, graving on the ground with level arms</l>
<l>The crucial sign, he prayed for pardoning grace,</l>
<l>And grace of lengthened days for penitence,</l>
<l>And all in name of Him whose agony</l>
<l>Upon the cross he thus in dust recalled!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>The sword is stayed, and in the tremulous pause</l>
<l>Great waves of varying passions meet</l>
<l>And battle in Giovanni's breast. Through all</l>
<l>A voice, as of faint music o'er the din</l>
<l>Of tumult, whispers: <q rend='pre'><hi rend='italic'>Who loveth brother more</hi></q></l>
<l><hi rend='italic'>Than me, or any loved one more than me,</hi></l>
<l><q rend='post'><hi rend='italic'>Is all unworthy of me.</hi></q> Quick, with ever</l>
<l>Conquering motions of the Spirit's power,</l>
<l>As winds of peace the passionate waters calm,</l>
<l>His sword is dropped, and, offering helpful hands,</l>
<l>He cries: <q rend='pre'>Thou who hast slain my brother be</q></l>
<l><q rend='post'>As Christ doth will&mdash;a brother unto me.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>O'erwhelmed with gratitude, and filled with deep</l>
<l>Contrition for his sin, the uplifted foe</l>
<l>Lets fall his head upon Giovanni's neck,</l>
<l>And there with loosened torrent of remorse</l>
<l>He pours the unguent of his tears, as once</l>
<l>Another penitent poured costly balm</l>
<l>Upon the Holiest One, growing therefrom</l>
<l>Through mercy's twofold grace to peace and joy.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>While yet the day was young, the legend tells</l>
<l>How both these humbled, contrite cavaliers</l>
<l>Offered their thanks for comfort at the shrine</l>
<l>Whither their steps together now were led;</l>
<l>And how, while kneeling at the crucifix,</l>
<l>Broke from the Saviour's parted lips a smile</l>
<l>Upon Giovanni, while the sacred head</l>
<l>In gracious token bowed.</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 10'>O crowning joy!</l>

<l>Henceforth no other smile was aught to him</l>

<head>Odd Stories. VIII. Snifkin.</head>

<p>
There certainly was a time when
dogs were more respected than
now. Such a period in particular
must have been the reign of Gigag,
when the Odomites, who had once
kicked, maimed, and starved their
poor curs in a manner inhuman,
now fed and fondled them with an
affection that was almost canine.
This revolution in sentiment was
entirely due to what may be called
a genius of instinct possessed by
one extraordinary dog. His owner,
who was none other than the goblin
Gigag, had, in one of those
journeys which he sometimes took
through his underground thoroughfare,
named his four-footed companion,
with a fond conceit, Snifkin;
and when they emerged into the
atmosphere of the king's grounds,
the latter was allowed the chief
place at supper among the royal
dogs. Some of this many-colored
pack were wont to bark, as others
were to bite. Some were renowned
for scent and vigilance, and
others for speed and courage;
still others for motley skins, lapping
lips, great ears, and yelling,
yelping, and howling. But the
dog Snifkin united their best qualities
with a sagacity that was almost
diplomatic. He never barked till
he was prepared to bite, and he
sometimes bit without barking. He
had a scent and sight which are
only acquired by dogs who have
seen a great deal of human nature.
So various and cabalistic seemed
the marks and colors upon him,
that the vulgar ascribed them to the
science of Gigag rather than to
natural revelation. To crown all,
the dog Snifkin showed his ivory
teeth at times, sneezing, snorting,
and laughing in a way next to human
for its friendliness.
</p>

<p>
From a number of the faculties
described arose two incidents which
increased the fame and worth of all
dogs, and which no man can sufficiently
admire. A miser, in whom
the sagacious Snifkin recognized a
former oppressor of his kind, came
to plead his cause at court, alleging
his ownership of four hundred
and ninety-five thriving estates, and
prosecuting his poor nephew for
about as many cents. At a contrast
so preposterous the knowing
dog could not contain himself, and
sniffed, snorted, and showed his
teeth to such a degree that even
his royal master, at whose side he
sat during the hearing of the plea,
was forced to join in the general
guffaw which greeted the miser.
</p>

<p>
Another incident related chiefly
to one of four malcontent noblemen,
who, with bows and smiles, came
to the royal presence. With no
more ado the dog Snifkin jumped
at his throat, bringing him to the
foot of the king, when a concealed
bodkin fell out of his bosom, and a
number of poisons, which Gigag
recognized as badly prepared, were
strewn upon the floor. Without a
word the king understood why it
was that his dumb counsellor had
not taken soup that day. While
<pb n='715'/><anchor id='Pg715'/>
irons were being placed on the
limbs of the malcontents, a collar
made of the finest cloth of gold,
adorned with precious stones, was
put upon the neck of the loyal dog.
By sovereign order it was decreed
that, taking with him all the dogs
in the kennels of the palace, the
crown crier should go out and cry
to all the people the patriotism of
Snifkin, and the fidelity of dogs
generally.
</p>

<p>
But it would require a million
miracles to convince those whose
unreason has placed them nearest
to the brutes, that dogs and other
animals, human and inhuman, exist
for the trying and proving of the
souls of men. As Snifkin was one
day seated in the high easy-chair
of the barber who clipped and
shaved for the king's dogs, a commotion
in the street provoked him
to bark loudly, hazarding thereby
the loss of his nose at the hands of
the barber. Arrived in the street,
what was his surprise to see fifty
of the royal hounds yelping in the
most distressful manner over the
loss of his tail by the chief hound,
who had provoked by impudent
barking a slashing cut from the
sword of a cavalier, who, it came to
be known, was a conspirator against
the life of King Gigag. Not being
able to contend with swordsmen,
Snifkin quickly seized upon the
largest and finest specimen of the
breed of curs who barked against
the king's hounds, and made short
work of him.
</p>

<p>
This act, loyal though it was, became
the signal for that factious
state of feeling among the Odomites
which eventuated in the famous
war of tails. Most of the best dogs
belonging to the houses which
barked against the king having had
their tails cut off, it grew to be a
fashion with the malcontents of
the realm to reject everything with
a tail to it, even were it a shirt, or
an entailed estate not already owned
and occupied by one of their
number, or a story which was not
to be continued. In fact, it became
a question whether they
would give ear to any tale whatever,
and hence it was truly said of the
malcontent faction that their ears
were longer than their tails. Of
course the scientific king lost no
time in improving the situation;
indeed, of putting an end to it.
He trained a pack of dogs, under
the teaching of Snifkin, to scent out
treason, and, when that was done,
he managed to give the hydrophobia
to a large number of rebellious
curs, who afterwards bit their masters.
The dog Snifkin barked
against this measure in vain.
</p>

<p>
A war now broke out, assisted by
the prince of a neighboring country,
who had conceived a great hatred
of the goblin Gigag. It was the
habit of the royal dogs to discover
supplies to their masters, and
guard their camp at night, and, besides,
to indicate in what direction
were the princely headquarters and
trains of the enemy, which they
knew by the smell of many viands.
</p>

<p>
The same, perhaps, would have
been the practice of those dogs
without tails who barked for the malcontents
and their ally, were it not
that the poor fare they received
compelled their flight to the better
provisions of the enemy. Nevertheless,
it would have gone hard with
King Gigag if his rival's device of
drawing off the dogs by a concentration
of savory meats in an ambushed
ravine had succeeded; for
the king, had it not been for the
sagacity of Snifkin, would certainly
have gone to the dogs. Despairing
now of being able to foil their antagonists,
the allies heard with
<pb n='716'/><anchor id='Pg716'/>
growing dismay the general bark
and howl in the king's camp at
night ere his warriors slept upon
their arms. Only a low growl here
and there, or perhaps the voice of
some lonely hound who had strayed
out of camp to bay the moon,
broke the silence of the sleep of
war.
</p>

<p>
While thus the silent avalanche
was prepared that was to overwhelm
the allies in the carnage of civil
strife, a most unforeseen accident
occurred. King Gigag was on his
rounds through the camp when
a dog taken with hydrophobia bit
him in the leg. Returning mad to
his headquarters, he saw the dog
Snifkin laughing and wagging his
tail, and, frenzied by the sight, he
drew his sword, and at once cut off
the whole of that pleasant appendage.
Immediately the dog Snifkin
became the most beautiful young
prince you ever saw. Seizing an
enchanted blade that hung up in
the tent of the goblin, he defended
himself with fury, and by an artful
stroke put the unlucky Gigag out
of his pains. When it became
known throughout both camps that
King Gigag had cut off the tail of
the dog Snifkin, a reconciliation
grew apace between those dogs who
had tails and those dogs who had
none; and, indeed, the royal
hounds especially were anxious to
have their tails cut off, so that they
might turn at once into princes;
but, unfortunately, this result never
happened, two of these dogs at
least having been curtailed, to their
great shame and mortification, without
so much as becoming scullions,
or anything but unlucky dogs. It
was then seen by the Odomites that
the dog Snifkin was none other
than their long-lost Prince Gudood,
who would have been devoured by
the giant Googloom, had not the
goblins got hold of him and changed
him into a dog; in which character
he served the excellent goblin Gigag,
who, however, was not made
aware of his identity by the evil
goblins from whom he had escaped.
By means of a birthmark on his
right arm the allied lords were
speedily brought to understand
that this, indeed, was the long-lost
prince who had been affianced to
the daughter of the neighboring
king. And now with one heart and
soul they hastened the marriage of
the prince and princess, who ever
afterwards lived happily in the joy
and glory and union of both kingdoms.
In the magnificent bridal
procession nothing was more astonishing
than the thousand trained
dogs of all kinds, large and
small, who marched in order, clad
sometimes in variegated suits, and
wearing rich collars. First came
the royal hounds and mastiffs; second,
a fine breed of mountaineer
dogs as large as wolves; third, two
or three hundred pointers, spotted
all colors; fourth, as many setters,
their backs streaked with colors
like gold and snow; fifth, a battalion
of mixed red, white, and blue
dogs; sixth, a body of sky-terriers,
followed by the finest array of
black-and-tan dogs that was ever
known; sixth, a large number of
dogs who looked like nothing so
much as walking hearth-rugs;
seventh, a noble lot of shaggy water-dogs
as large as men; then a
great many shepherd-dogs, spaniels,
poodles, pups; after these a battalion
of dogs shaved to look like
lions; and finally a rear-guard of
bull-dogs with their tails cut off,
walking as steadily as firemen on
parade. A loud and harmonious
barking at intervals interrupted the
sound of the wedding bells, and
five hundred terrier dogs at least
<pb n='717'/><anchor id='Pg717'/>
stood up on their hind legs when
the marriage ceremony was performed.
</p>

<p>
Thus the reign of humanity and
utility succeeded to the reign of
science and pelf. Only dogs were
allowed to do the fighting, and
they were treated so well that they
did nothing worse than bark. The
following conversation was one
time overhead among them in a
street near the king's palace:
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Royal Mastiff.</hi>&mdash;Bowoghowow!
Bowgh!
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Hound without tail.</hi>&mdash;Boowoogh!
Boohoo! Wowoo!
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Terrier dog.</hi>&mdash;Gr-r-r-r-row, r-row!
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Bull-dog.</hi>&mdash;Hr-r-r-um-g-r-r-u-m.
Bowowgh!
</p>

<p>
From these syllables it was conjectured
by the knowing that the
new King Gudood had no enemies,
and that peace abode in the land.

This pamphlet, the English original of
which we have not seen, has been sent to
us from Geneva, by the author, we presume.
The Rev. F. I. T. (not J. F.)
Hecker has been abroad, travelling for
the restoration of his impaired health, for
more than a year, and cannot, therefore,
give his personal attention to Mr. Olmstead's
very courteous <hi rend='italic'>Letter</hi>, at least for
the present, and in the columns of <hi rend='smallcaps'>The
Catholic World</hi>. Moreover, the author
is mistaken in attributing a certain
article in <hi rend='smallcaps'>The Catholic World</hi>, with
which he chiefly employs his pen in
the <hi rend='italic'>Letter</hi>, to F. Hecker. The article
in question is one of the numerous contributions
with which Dr. Brownson
enriched and adorned our pages during
the interval of the suspension of
his own <hi rend='italic'>Review</hi>. In our opinion, Mr.
Olmstead has not dealt a very heavy
blow upon the head-piece of his veteran
antagonist. In fact, we do not see that
he has attempted any serious answer to
arguments which he would find it no
easy task to refute. Mr. Olmstead deals
more in objections and assertions than
in arguments, and his assertions are so
general and vague that one would need
to write a treatise on general and special
metaphysics to refute them. They merely
amount to this: that Mr. Olmstead
agrees with Kant and J. Stuart Mill. F.
Hecker's works were written for persons
who either believe in some sense
in Christianity, or at least in God and in
human reason and intelligence. It is not
necessary to prove the premises admitted
by the persons with whom you argue.
If they are Protestants, you assume the
truth of Christianity. Your only effort is
then to prove that Catholicity is the genuine
Christianity. If they are rationalistic
theists, you prove that the truth of
Christianity, and specifically the authority
of the church as one of its essential doctrines
and laws, is demonstrable from
principles of reason and natural theology.
When it is a question of arguing with an
atheist or sceptic, these topics must be
postponed, and the discussion turned
upon the first principles of metaphysics.
Even here something in common must
be admitted as a starting-point for argument.
If a man denies everything
or doubts everything, the only thing
which can possibly be done is to watch
him closely until he asserts something,
and then you can do no more than
show to a bystander his absurdity. If
we understand Mr. Olmstead correctly,
he admits the reality of all that is contained
within self-consciousness, and
considers all else, by the mere fact of its
being exterior to consciousness, as an
unknown quantity in respect to its reality.
<pb n='718'/><anchor id='Pg718'/>
He merely holds this, however, as an
opinion, and admits that the contrary
is very probable. If he is in earnest&mdash;and
it is fair to presume that he is&mdash;in searching
for philosophical truth, the only way
in which a Catholic philosopher could
argue with him to any purpose would
be by presenting a theory of the origin
of ideas and knowledge, which would
give him something objective as a primitive
element in his very first act of intellectual
self-consciousness. This is rather
too serious a task to be performed in a
hurry. Whatever we have to say on
these great fundamental topics of philosophy
has been already partly said in
the elaborate articles which have appeared
in our columns, and will be said
hereafter in articles of a similar nature.
We refer the author of the <hi rend='italic'>Letter</hi> and

of light we are able to furnish
them. If they wish for more light, they
must go to the great works of great authors,
and study them carefully. As for
the great number of very excellent persons
who do not trouble their heads with
philosophy, and who complain that our
philosophical articles are too dry and
abstruse, we must beg them to content
themselves with the lighter portions of
the magazine, and allow us to give a reasonable
amount of space to the few
readers who have some taste and capacity
for real science.

This work has a promising look, the

<p>
Military biography has a strange charm
for most readers; indeed, it is doubtful
whether fiction has an equal fascination
at certain periods of our lives. Few of
us have attained middle age without having
had our cheeks frequently glow and
our patriotism grow warm at the narration
of deeds of prowess performed by
our favorite heroes. Unfortunately, however,
the production of this species of literature
has fallen to a great extent into
the hands of literary adventurers-writers
who looked only to making the most of
a profitable enterprise. Hence the periodical
eruption of lives of great captains,
distinguished, indeed, as men count greatness,
but whose most valid claim to eminence
consisted in their ability to destroy
whatever opposed the realization of the
objects of their ambition, and the permanent
maintenance of unjustly-won
crowns. To this cause we may partly
attribute the fact that people have well-nigh
<pb n='720'/><anchor id='Pg720'/>
lost sight of the loftiest form of
heroism&mdash;that which prompts a man to
stake everything on the defence of a

all privations, so that conscience be
kept pure and the Christian character
preserved unsullied.

The work under notice belongs to a
different category. It is written, for the
most part, in a calm, judicial spirit, the
author evidently intending to avoid partisanship,
and exhibiting a painstaking
fidelity to the data before him. Occasionally,
however, he betrays the hero-worshipper
in the case of individuals who
appear anything but admirable to us.
On such common ground as the sketch
of Washington we are glad to express
our agreement with the author. We also
like his estimate of anecdotes as illustrations
of character.

the county, state, or kingdom in

<head>II.</head>

<p>
The activity displayed by matter
in the production of natural phenomena
is twofold, viz., attractive
and repulsive; and the question
has been raised whether these two
kinds of activity can reside in one
and the same subject, or, owing to
their opposite nature, require separate
subjects. With regard to molecules,
it is quite certain, though
some have thought otherwise, that
in all ponderable bodies each molecule
is in possession of both powers;
but with regard to the primitive
elements which enter into
the constitution of a molecule, the
question needs a special treatment,
as no direct evidence is supplied
by experimental science for an affirmative
more than for a negative
solution, and different views have
been advanced which it is important
to examine in the light of philosophical
principles, that we may
ascertain which of them has the
best claim to adoption both in philosophy
and in molecular mechanics.
</p>

<div>
<head>Attractive and repulsive powers.</head>

<p>
Since
it is well known that all the
phenomena of the material order,
whether physical or chemical, ultimately
depend on attractions and
repulsions, we are compelled to admit
the existence in nature of attractive
and repulsive powers. Neither
attractive powers alone nor
repulsive powers alone would afford
us a rational explanation of natural
facts. If the primitive elements
of matter were all repulsive, and
nothing but repulsive, then neither
the cohesion of material particles
nor the gravitation of bodies would
be possible; no solid and no liquid
would exist; and all matter from
the very beginning of its existence
would have vanished in a state of
extreme attenuation through the
immensity of space. If, on the
contrary, the primitive elements of
matter were all attractive, and nothing
<pb n='722'/><anchor id='Pg722'/>
but attractive, no expansive
power would be found in nature;
for the expansion of bodies evidently
depends on a repulsion prevailing
between their molecules. All
solid and liquid bodies likewise
proclaim the existence of repulsive
powers by the resistance they oppose
to compression. This resistance
shows that their molecules are
endowed with powers whose exertion
impedes their mutual approach
as soon as they have reached a certain
limit of distance. It is plain
that the power which impedes the
approach under pressure must be a
repulsive one. Thus both attractive
and repulsive powers exist in
nature.
</p>

<p>
But do they exist together in the
same primitive element of matter?
Boscovich answers in the affirmative;
but his answer is not supported
by any cogent reason. Having
found no other means of accounting
for the impenetrability of bodies,
he assumed that every element of
matter is so constituted as to be attractive
at all great distances, according
to the law of universal attraction,
but that each element, at
molecular distances, becomes repulsive
in order to resist pressure,
and again attractive in order to exercise
chemical affinity, and then
repulsive again, these alternations
going on a certain number of times,
till at last repulsivity alone prevails,
which indefinitely increases when
the distance of two elements indefinitely
diminishes.
</p>

<p>
Yet this theory is by no means
needed to account either for the
impenetrability of bodies or for
any other phenomenon; as what
Boscovich ascribes to elements
may be, and is in fact, a property of
molecules&mdash;that is, of a compound
system of elements. On the other
hand, the theory is unnaturally
complex, and the alternation of the
attractive and repulsive exertions
looks as unscientific as the epicycles
of the old astronomers and other
hypotheses once admitted as plausible,
and now superseded by a fuller
knowledge of natural laws. To a
mind which examines the question
of attractive and repulsive powers
in the light of philosophy, it must
be evident that each primitive element
of matter cannot possess them
both. <hi rend='italic'>If an element is attractive at
any distance, it must be attractive at
all distances, whether enormously
great or indefinitely small; likewise,
if an element is repulsive at any
distance, it must be repulsive at all
distances.</hi>
</p>

<p>
This proposition can be proved
as follows: Opposite actions cannot
originate from one and the same
simple principle when such a principle
has no control over itself, but
acts by inherent necessity. But in
each primitive element of matter
there is but one simple principle of
activity, which has no control over
itself, as it acts by inherent necessity.
And therefore no primitive
element can be both attractive and
repulsive, but is either attractive at
all distances or at all distances repulsive.
</p>

<p>
In this syllogism the major is
evident. An active principle
which, like the human soul, can,
by immanent operations, assume at
pleasure different attitudes towards
the term of its action, and which
masters the conditions and controls
the intensity of its exertions, may
perhaps be considered competent
to originate actions of opposite
kinds.<note place='foot'>The only <emph>efficient</emph> actions of our soul are
those by which the will carries its desires into
execution. This is done by the will, not as the
faculty of willing, but as a moving power, and
consequently by means of a truly efficient action.
The immanent operations of the soul are, on
the contrary, formal acts, not efficient actions.
The intellect and the will are moved by their
objects in a manner analogous to that in which
a material element is moved by physical agents.
If an element could treasure up all the momenta
it receives from different agents, and were not
under the necessity of following their resultant,
but had the faculty of yielding at pleasure now to
this and now to that determination, then such
an element would give us a true image of what
our soul is competent to do by immanent operation.
The soul treasures up the <emph>species</emph> impressed
by intelligible objects, that is, its intellectual
momenta, and fields or not to the attraction of
any of them as it chooses. And the like occurs
with regard to the object of the will. To think
and to will is therefore nothing more than to let
one's self be carried by an object or in the direction
of an object. Accordingly, the soul, when
understanding or willing, is indeed actuated by
the object, and therefore is in act; but this act is
<hi rend='italic'>resultant</hi>, not <hi rend='italic'>efficient</hi>. In other terms, immanent
acts are not efficient actions, but formal attitudes
formally resulting from either spontaneous
or free movements of the appetitive potency.</note> But a being which is destitute
<pb n='723'/><anchor id='Pg723'/>
of immanent operations, and
acts by an inherent necessity of its
nature, has no power to modify itself
or to alter its intrinsic determination;
and its action is so ruled
by its intrinsic determination that
there is no chance of its being
either transmuted into its opposite,
or even partially suspended. Now,
in a primitive being the principle
of activity is nothing else than the
simple act which formally determines
its nature; and it is plain that
wherever there is one simple formal
act, there can be only one formal
determination to act. And consequently
a simple principle of activity
which has no immanent operations
cannot be the source of
two opposite kinds of actions.
Bodies and their molecules, on account
of their physical composition,
contain as many distinct principles
of activity as they contain physical
components or elements; hence
we can easily account for their capability
of originating opposite actions
by admitting that among
those elements some are attractive
and others repulsive. But in a
primitive element it is impossible
to admit of two opposite active
principles; for a primitive element
is a being entitatively one, having
only one essential act, and consequently
only one active principle and
one intrinsic determination to act.
It would therefore be absurd to expect
from such an element actions
of such an opposite nature as are
attraction and repulsion. For evidently,
to enable the element to
display two opposite powers, two
opposite determinations would be
necessary. Hence, if the intrinsic
determination enables the primitive
element to attract, such an element
will always attract, and never repel;
and if, on the contrary, the intrinsic
determination enables the primitive
element to repel, such an element
will always repel, and never attract.
In other terms, the attractive and
the repulsive power cannot coexist
in the same primitive element.
</p>

<p>
This conclusion, which affords
the only possible basis for the speculations
of molecular mechanics, is
one of those which mere scientists
cannot reach through their empirical
and inductive method; but its
truth is not less certain for that;
it is rather all the more certain, as
it is not founded on accidental facts,
but on the unchangeable nature of
things and the transcendental relation
of the principles involved in
the constitution of real beings.
</p>

<p>
Our proposition may be confirmed
by reflecting that the change of
attraction into repulsion, according
to Boscovich, would depend on the
diminution of the distance between
the agent and the patient. Now,
this view is inadmissible. For a
change of distance, though necessarily
accompanied by a change in
the intensity of the action, cannot
exercise any influence on the specific
nature of the action. The <hi rend='italic'>intensity</hi>
of the action is an accidental
thing, and can change without in the
<pb n='724'/><anchor id='Pg724'/>
least interfering with the nature of
the agent; and for this reason it
can, and must, depend on distance
as a condition implied in the exercise
of the active power. But the
<hi rend='italic'>nature</hi> of the action always follows
the nature of the substance from
which it proceeds. Now, a change
of distance does not change the nature
of the substance. And accordingly
the nature of the action must
remain the same, even though the
distance be indefinitely diminished.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, if there were any distance
at which the action of a primitive
element could change from attractive
to repulsive, evidently the
element, at such a distance, would
be unable to exercise either attraction
or repulsion, as Boscovich
concedes; and therefore, at such a
distance, the material element
would have no activity. We may,
then, ask: Whence does the attractive
power emanate which is to
have uncontrolled sway at all greater
distances? Does it emanate
from any point of space outside the
element? Then it would not be
the active power of the element, as
it would have nothing to do with
it. On the other hand, it is obvious
that if it emanates from the
element, it does not end at a distance
from it. For, since the active
power is really identical with
the formal principle from which the
primitive element receives its nature,
it is as necessary for the elementary
power to reach the very
centre of the element as it is for
the form to be intrinsically terminated
to its matter. Whence it follows
that the elementary power of
attraction, which prevails at all
great distances, must emanate from
the very centre of the element.
But if so, why shall it not prevail
up to that very centre? Is it, forsooth,
because in the neighborhood
of the centre an opposite principle
prevails? Were this the case, the
same primitive being would have
two formal acts, and it would be
<hi rend='italic'>two beings</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>two natures</hi>; which
is an evident contradiction. As
long, therefore, as we adhere to the
fundamental doctrine that a primitive
being cannot have more than
one simple principle of activity, we
must admit that a primitive element,
if attractive at any distance, is attractive
at all molecular distances,
and, if repulsive at molecular distances,
is repulsive at all distances.
</p>

<p>
Against the existence of attractive
and repulsive powers in distinct
primitive elements some objections
now and then have been
made. It has been said, first, that
what we call repulsion is only a
result of certain vortical movements
of the ether all around the molecules
of ponderable bodies. This
objection is based on a false supposition.
We have already shown
that the arbitrary theory of the
vortices fails altogether to explain
the great phenomenon of universal
attraction; and we may easily
show that it fails as completely in
regard to molecular repulsion. In
fact, the centrifugal forces which
are developed by vortical movements,
and which in this theory are
assumed as the cause of the phenomena
of molecular resistances, are
not active powers. They are components
of the vortical movements,
and nothing more; that is to say,
they do not <hi rend='italic'>efficiently</hi> produce
movements, but are the <hi rend='italic'>formal</hi> principles
of movements already produced.
To ascribe to them the molecular
resistances and the impenetrability
of bodies is, therefore, to
admit the effect without the cause.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, some authors object
that the resistance called into play
by pressure is not a real action, and
<pb n='725'/><anchor id='Pg725'/>
requires no efficient repulsive powers.
They consider it, according
to the vulgar prejudice, as a merely
<hi rend='italic'>passive</hi> resistance; for they imagine
that a body, when pressed or impinged
on, resists the progress of
the obtruding body <hi rend='italic'>by its own inert
matter</hi>, which with its materiality
obstructs the way onward. This
old explanation is still popular with
the great mass of the uninstructed,
but is scientifically and philosophically
worthless. For whatever
causes a real change really acts;
now, a body resisting the advance
of another body causes a real
change in the rate of its movement;
therefore a body resisting the advance
of another body really acts.
Its resistance is therefore <hi rend='italic'>active</hi>, and
not passive; that is, it consists in
an exertion of repulsive power, and
not in a material obstruction of the
path.
</p>

<p>
Hence what physicists call <q>force
of inertia</q> is not a passive resistance
proceeding from the inertia of
matter, but an active exertion of
the molecular powers, and has been
so called only because, all other
things being equal, its intensity is
proportional to the mass of the
inert body.<note place='foot'>On this subject see <hi rend='smallcaps'>The Catholic World</hi>
for March, 1874, p. 768.</note> Evidently, inertia
itself cannot resist or check the
advance of an impinging body.
Nothing but a positive action can
do it; for nothing but a positive
action can communicate to the advancing
body that impetus in the
opposite direction which alone is
competent to neutralize the impetus
of the advance. Physicists know
this very well, though many of
them, owing to the difficulty of
analyzing and expressing certain
things with philosophical accuracy,
do not always use, in this particular,
a very correct language&mdash;a thing
which, after all, must not surprise
us, as one can be well read in physics
without necessarily being a
profound philosopher.
</p>

<p>
The third objection is aimed at
our argument against Boscovich's
theory, in which we have said that
attraction and repulsion are actions
of opposite kinds. Boscovich, on
the contrary, maintains that attraction
and repulsion differ only as the
greater from the less, and therefore
cannot be considered as actions of
a different kind. He says: <q>Both
actions are of the same kind; for
the one, as compared with the
other, is negative; and negative
things do not differ in kind from
positive ones. That the one, as
compared with the other, is negative,
is evident from this: that they
differ only in direction. That the
negative and the positive belong to
the same kind is evident from the
principle, <hi rend='italic'>More and less do not differ
in kind</hi>. In fact, from the positive,
by a continued subtraction or
diminution, we obtain first some
smaller positive quantities, then
zero, and lastly, if we still go on in
our subtraction, negative quantities.</q><note place='foot'>Boscovich's <hi rend='italic'>Theoria Philosophiæ Naturalis</hi>,
part i. n. 108.</note>
</p>

<p>
This argument, notwithstanding
its speciousness, is not difficult to
upset. It is not true, in the first
place, that attraction and repulsion
differ only in direction; on the
contrary, they differ in everything
except in direction. Two points
<hi rend='italic'>A</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>B</hi> being given, there is only
one direction from <hi rend='italic'>A</hi> to <hi rend='bold'>B</hi>, whether
<hi rend='italic'>A</hi> be attractive or repulsive. If <hi rend='italic'>A</hi>
is attractive, its attraction is directed
from <hi rend='italic'>A</hi> to <hi rend='italic'>B</hi>; and if <hi rend='italic'>A</hi> is repulsive,
its repulsion is no less directed
from <hi rend='italic'>A</hi> to <hi rend='italic'>B</hi>. This is quite
evident, as the action must in all
cases proceed from the agent to
<pb n='726'/><anchor id='Pg726'/>
the patient. It is evident, therefore,
that the two actions must have the
same direction. The movements
of <hi rend='italic'>B</hi> will indeed have opposite
directions, according as <hi rend='italic'>B</hi> is attracted
or repelled; but this does not
show that the actions themselves
have opposite directions; it shows,
on the contrary, that those actions,
though directed in the same manner
from <hi rend='italic'>A</hi> to <hi rend='italic'>B</hi>, are of a different
nature, and proceed from opposite
principles. And this conclusion
may be confirmed by remarking
that the direction is always from a
point to a point, or from matter to
matter; and consequently it is not
the active power or the action,
but only the position of the material
centres, that can determine any
direction. Accordingly, so long as
such a position is not inverted, it
is impossible to conceive two opposite
directions from <hi rend='italic'>A</hi> to <hi rend='italic'>B</hi>. It is
therefore evidently false that attraction
and repulsion differ in direction.
</p>

<p>
It is not true, in the second place,
that attraction and repulsion differ
only as the positive differs from the
negative, or the greater from the
less. In the mathematical expression
of mechanical relations, if we
consider a movement as positive,
the movement which points to an
opposite direction must, of course,
be affected by the negative sign.
The same we must do with regard
to forces and actions; for we estimate
the actions by the movements
which they produce, and we express
them only in terms of movement&mdash;that
is, by their effects. But this
does not mean that there is either
any movement or any action <emph>absolutely</emph>
negative; for a negative
movement would be no movement,
and a negative action no action.
It is in a relative and conventional
sense only that movements are considered
as positive or negative;
and, moreover, either of the two
opposite movements can be assumed
as positive or as negative, at
will; which shows very clearly that
the negative and the positive do
not differ in this case as the greater
differs from the less, as Boscovich
assumes; for either of the two can,
at pleasure, be taken as positive,
whereas it would be absurd to pretend
that either of the two can, at
pleasure, be pronounced to be the
greater. Thus, when a stone is
thrown up vertically, and abandoned
to itself, if its ascent is taken as
positive, its descent will be considered
as negative. Now, according
to Boscovich's reasoning, we should
infer that <hi rend='italic'>the ascent is greater than
the descent</hi>, though they are evidently
equal. And in the same manner,
if the ascent is taken as negative
(which nothing forbids), the descent
must be taken as positive; whence,
according to Boscovich, we ought
to infer also that <hi rend='italic'>the descent is greater
than the ascent</hi>. Any argument
which leads to such glaring contradictions
must be radically false.
And therefore it is false that attraction
and repulsion differ from one
another as the greater from the
less.
</p>

<p>
It might be urged, as a fourth
objection, that if an attractive and
a repulsive power differ in kind,
then a repulsive element and an
attractive element will be two kinds
of material substance; which is
inadmissible. For we cannot admit
two kinds of primitive material beings
essentially different, as the essence
of matter must be the same
in all the elements.
</p>

<p>
To this we answer that although
there are two kinds of elements,
there are not two kinds of matter.
In other terms, an attractive element
differs from a repulsive one as
<pb n='727'/><anchor id='Pg727'/>
to the principle of action, but not
as to the matter itself. In fact, the
essence of a material being <hi rend='italic'>as such</hi>
requires nothing more than a form
giving existence to matter; hence,
wherever there is a form giving existence
to matter, there also is the
essence of matter. Now, matter is
as much and as completely actuated
by a form or act which is a principle
of attraction as by a form or act
which is a principle of repulsion.
For the actuation of the matter by
its form is not <hi rend='italic'>efficient</hi>, but <hi rend='italic'>formal</hi>;
and its result is not <hi rend='italic'>to approach</hi> by
attraction or <hi rend='italic'>to recede</hi> by repulsion,
but <hi rend='italic'>to be</hi> simply and absolutely; so
that neither attractivity nor repulsivity
has any bearing on the essential
constitution of a material element
as such&mdash;that is, inasmuch as
it is material. Accordingly, two
elements of opposite natures differ
in kind as agents, but not as <hi rend='italic'>material</hi>
beings; and thus the essence
of matter <hi rend='italic'>as such</hi> remains one and
the same in all the elements. Matter,
as we have already shown, is
the centre of a sphere of activity;
and it is evident that, by this activity
of an attractive or of a repulsive
nature, the centre remains
a centre, and the sphere a sphere,
without the least alteration. Gold
and ivory differ in kind; but a
sphere of ivory and a sphere of gold
do not differ in kind <hi rend='italic'>as spheres</hi>, and
their centres do not differ in kind
<hi rend='italic'>as centres</hi>. In a like manner the
sphere of activity of an attractive
element does not differ from the
sphere of activity of a repulsive element,
nor the centre of the one
from the centre of the other. And
therefore two elements, however
different in their nature as agents,
do not cease to be of the same kind
as material. Their form is different,
but informs equally, and their
matter is exactly the same.
</p>

<p>
We have stated that Boscovich
was led to admit two opposite powers
in the same element, because he
thought this to be the only means
of accounting for the impenetrability
of bodies. We observe that,
although the impenetrability of bodies
peremptorily proves the existence
of repulsive powers, it by no
means proves that the repulsive
power coexists with the attractive
<hi rend='italic'>in the same primitive element</hi>.
Hence Boscovich's inference is not
legitimate. Molecules, as we have
already remarked, may possess both
powers, as their composition involves
a great number of elements,
which can be of different natures.
And this suffices to explain the
impenetrability of bodies, and all
other properties dependent on molecular
actions, without need of
arbitrary hypotheses.
</p>

<p>
A last objection against the doctrine
we have established might be
drawn from the difficulty of reconciling
the existence of repulsive
elements with universal attraction;
for if we admit that repulsion can
be exercised at astronomical distances,
it will be difficult to see how
the celestial bodies can attract one
another in the direct ratio of their
masses, as the law of attraction requires.
</p>

<p>
The answer is obvious. If all
matter were repulsive, universal repulsion
would be the consequence.
But if bodies are made up partly
of attractive and partly of repulsive
elements, then will either universal
repulsion or universal attraction
prevail, according as the number
and power of the repulsive elements
is greater or smaller than that of
the attractive ones. Hence, from
the fact that in the solar system
and elsewhere attraction prevails,
it follows, indeed, that the attractive
powers are the stronger, but it
<pb n='728'/><anchor id='Pg728'/>
does not follow that they are the
whole stuff of which bodies are
compounded.
</p>

<p>
As to the law of attraction <hi rend='italic'>in the
direct ratio of the masses</hi>, a distinction
is to be made. The law is
certainly true if by masses we mean
the masses <hi rend='italic'>acted on</hi>; not so, however,
if for the masses acted on we
substitute the masses of the attracting
bodies. The fact of universal
attraction shows that two planets,
all other things being equal, must
be attracted by the sun in the direct
ratio of their masses. This is
an established truth. But to say
that, all other things being equal,
the sun and the earth would attract
the moon in the direct ratio
of their <hi rend='italic'>absolute</hi> masses, is to assume
what no fact whatever gives us the
right to assert. Physicists very
commonly admit this second assumption,
and consider it a part of
the law of attraction; but they
would be not a little embarrassed
were they required to undertake its
demonstration. They take for
granted that all the particles of
matter are equally and uniformly
attractive. Now, this assumption
has never been established by facts;
it simply arises from an unlawful
generalization&mdash;that is, from the extension
of the law of kinetic forces
to dynamical actions. The momenta
of two bodies animated by
equal velocities are proportional to
the masses of the same bodies; but
nothing justifies the inference that
therefore the attractive powers
must be proportional to the masses.
Indeed, it is scarcely possible to
believe that equal masses of lead,
iron, and zinc possess equal powers.
Their properties are, in fact, so different
that we cannot assume their
constitution to be the result of an
assemblage of equal powers. Hence
we maintain that, unless two bodies
have the same molecular constitution,
their attractions cannot be
proportional to their masses.<note place='foot'>Cavendish in 1798 made his celebrated experiments
concerning terrestrial attraction, in
order to determine the density of the earth; but
his calculations were grounded on the assumption
that all the material particles of the earth
were equally attractive; and therefore the result
of such calculation cannot be implicitly relied
on. M. Reich in 1837, and M. Bayly in
1842, repeated the same experiments, and calculated
the density of the earth according to the
same assumption. It did not occur to either of
them that the assumption itself might have been
subjected to a crucial test by successively substituting
spheres of zinc, iron, copper, silver,
etc., instead of the leaden ones which they
uniformly employed. Had they tried these substances
in a proper manner&mdash;that is, with a suitable
modification of the apparatus&mdash;we have little
doubt that they would have discovered a
difference of action for equal masses of different
substances. The experiment may yet be made,
and we hope it will, as it is of great scientific
importance; but it should be encouraged by
the help of some powerful scientific body, as the
cost of the new apparatus would probably exceed
the ordinary means at the command of unaided
individuals.</note>
</p>

<p>
Universal attraction being also
proportional to the inverse squares
of the distances, as we are going to
show, we may add that the existence
of repulsive elements in the
sun and in the planets by no means
interferes with this law. In fact,
the total action of one celestial
body on another, on account of the
great distance at which the law
of universal attraction is applied,
equals the algebraic sum of all the
actions by which one body makes
an impression upon the other.
Hence, if all the elements of which
the body consists, whether they be
attractive or repulsive, act proportionally
to the inverse square of
the distance, it is evident that the
resultant of all such actions will
also be proportional to the inverse
square of the distance, whenever
the form of the body is spherical, or
nearly so, as is the case with the celestial
bodies. And thus it is plain
that no valid objection can be drawn
from universal attraction against the
existence of repulsive elements.

<div>
<head>Law of elementary actions.</head>

<p>
We
have now to establish the general
law of elementary attraction and
repulsion. We hold that <hi rend='italic'>the actions
of every primitive element are always
inversely proportional to the squares
of the distances, no matter whether
such distances be great or small, astronomical
or molecular</hi>.
</p>

<p>
This proposition can be briefly
proved in the following manner:
Astronomy teaches us that the
Newtonian law, according to which
the actions are inversely proportional
to the squares of the distances,
is true for all the celestial
bodies. Now, the total action of
one celestial body upon another is
a resultant of elementary actions,
and arises from the algebraic sum
of them all. Hence it follows that
every element of matter, when acting
from certain distances, obeys
the Newtonian law; for it is evident,
from the theory of the composition
of forces, that the sum of
the elementary actions cannot follow
the Newtonian law unless these
actions themselves follow it. But
if the law is true in the case of
astronomical distances, it must be
true also in the case of microscopical
and molecular distances. For
as a primitive element cannot have
two laws of action, so neither can
it follow at molecular distances any
other law than that which it follows
at all other distances.
</p>

<p>
That a primitive element cannot
have two different laws of action
will be manifest by considering that
the law which an element obeys in
its actions results from the intrinsic
determination of its nature&mdash;that
is, from its formal constitution&mdash;inasmuch
as the principle of action
is, in every primitive substance, the
formal principle of its very being:
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Principium essendi est principium operandi</foreign>.
Now, a primitive element
has but one formal principle of being;
for it is entitatively one, and
therefore it has but one formal determination
to act, which, as resulting
from its essential constitution,
is unchangeable and inviolable.
But it is evident that from <emph>one</emph> formal
determination to act only <emph>one</emph>
law of action can possibly result.
Two laws would be two formal results,
and would require two formal
principles giving two different determinations.
Accordingly, since
each primitive element has but one
formal principle, it cannot have two
laws of action. And therefore the
Newtonian law, which primitive
elements follow at astronomical
distances, must prevail also at all
other distances.
</p>

<p>
Let the reader observe that this
conclusion regards the action of
primitive <hi rend='italic'>elements</hi>, not the action of
<hi rend='italic'>molecules</hi>. That molecular actions
at molecular distances are not inversely
proportional to the square
of the distance is a known fact.
Molecular cohesion, for instance, is
immensely greater than it could
possibly be by the Newtonian law;
so also molecular repulsion. This
is what prevented physicists from
recognizing the applicability of the
Newtonian law at molecular distances.
As long as the primitive
elements were confounded, under
the name of atoms, with the molecules
of the so-called primitive
bodies, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon,
etc., it was impossible to recognize
in the molecular actions any trace
of the Newtonian law; hence came
the division of attraction into <hi rend='italic'>universal</hi>
and <hi rend='italic'>molecular</hi>, the first following
a known law, the second
following some other law or laws
which physicists could never discover.
Their embarrassment was
a necessary consequence of an incomplete
analysis of the material
<pb n='730'/><anchor id='Pg730'/>
compound. The molecule of a
given substance, though often called
an atom, is a system of primitive
elements; and elements acting
according to the Newtonian law
can give rise to molecular systems
which, at very small distances, will
act according to any other law that
may be indicated by molecular phenomena.
This other law depends
entirely on the number, kind,
strength, and geometrical arrangement
of the primitive elements
which enter into the constitution
of the molecule; and since molecules
of different primitive substances
are very differently constituted,
every kind of molecule must have
its own peculiar law of acting at
molecular distances&mdash;a fact on
which the scientific explanation of
the different physical and chemical
properties of different substances
entirely depends. Hence it is
clear that all the attempts at finding
a general law of molecular attraction
were, from the very nature
of the case, destined to fail. The
only general law of action which
all matter obeys is the Newtonian
law; and what was once considered
to form an exception to it is now
acknowledged to be the result of its
application to a complex system of
attractive and repulsive elements.
</p>

<p>
From the fact that the actions
of all elements are proportional to
the inverse squares of the distances,
it follows that the sphere of activity
of material elements extends beyond
any assignable limit. The
intensity of the action cannot, in
fact, become = 0 unless the distance
becomes infinite. The objections
to which this corollary of
the Newtonian law may give rise
will be answered in our next article,
where all the difficulties concerning
the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>actio in distans</foreign> will be
solved.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>Mode of action.</head>

<p>
A last question
remains here to be examined respecting
the action of primitive
material elements&mdash;viz., whether
such an action needs a medium
through which it may be transmitted
and communicated to distant
bodies, or whether, on the contrary,
it is exerted upon them directly
without dependence on any material
medium.
</p>

<p>
In answering this question we
must be careful not to confound
action with movement. Movement,
though not properly transmitted, is
propagated, as we shall explain;
and this cannot take place where
there is no movable matter. Those
who are wont to identify movement
with force, and force with action,
as is unfortunately the fashion even
in scientific treatises, will no doubt
imagine that actions must be transmitted
or propagated through a
material medium, just as sound
through air, or as light through
luminiferous ether. But action is
not movement; and therefore the
question how elementary actions&mdash;that
is, how attractions or repulsions&mdash;reach
distant bodies has to
be resolved on its own merit, as
one altogether distinct from the
question about the propagation of
movement. This premised, we are
going to show that <hi rend='italic'>the elementary
actions are independent of all material
medium of communication</hi>.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, there is no reason
why we should assume that
the elementary action (attraction
or repulsion) depends on a medium
of communication, except inasmuch
as we may apprehend that
the action itself, or the active power
whence it proceeds, is in need
of being transmitted to some matter
located at a certain distance.
But neither the elementary power
nor the elementary action can be
<pb n='731'/><anchor id='Pg731'/>
transmitted to the distant matter.
And therefore neither the power
nor the action can be dependent
on a medium of communication.
</p>

<p>
In this syllogism the major is
evident; and the minor can be
proved in two manners: First, because
the power and the action are,
of their own nature, intransmissible.
Secondly, because, prescinding
from their intransmissibility,
no medium can be assigned which
would be capable of transmitting
them. And as to the first, we
know that nothing can be transmitted
to a distant place except by
local movement; but neither the
active power nor the elementary
action is capable of receiving local
movement; for there is no other
subject capable of local movement
than matter alone, on account of its
passive potentiality. Hence neither
power nor action can be transmitted.
And in the second place,
even were they transmissible, what
medium could be found for their
transmission? If any such medium
could be found, it would consist
of some matter like ether or
air, this being the view of those
who admit the necessity of such a
medium. On the other hand, a
material substance is not a suitable
medium for transmitting action or
power. For whenever an active
power is exerted upon matter, the
result of the exertion is nothing
but a determination to a change of
place; as it is well known that
matter cannot receive any other determination.
And therefore it is
not the power that is received in
the matter acted on, but only the
act produced by its exertion, which
act is otherwise called a momentum
either statical or dynamical.
Strictly speaking, not even the action
itself is received in the matter,
although we are wont to tolerate
such an expression; for the action
properly so called is the production
of an act, and the matter receives,
indeed, the act produced, but
not its production. And thus the
action, properly speaking, is <hi rend='italic'>terminated</hi>
to the matter, and not <hi rend='italic'>received</hi>
in it. Hence we see that
neither the power of the agent nor
its exertion is received in the matter
acted on; it is merely the produced
accidental act, or, in other
terms, the momentum, that is received.
But evidently matter cannot
transmit what it does not receive.
And therefore matter cannot
be a medium for transmitting
either power or action. Whether
it can transmit movement we shall
examine at the end of the present
question.
</p>

<p>
This argument would suffice to
show that elementary actions are
quite independent of a material
medium. Yet as the prejudice
against which we are fighting is ancient,
popular, and deeply rooted,
we think it will not be superfluous
to confirm our proof by a few other
considerations.
</p>

<p>
Those who maintain the transmission
of forces admit a material
medium, in which, by successive
contact of particles with particles,
the transmission of the force to a
distant body is supposed to be carried
on. By the word <q>force</q>
they understand action as well as
movement. Now, let us ask them
whether the particles of their material
medium come into mathematical
contact or not. If they do not
come into mathematical contact,
then the action is not transmitted
by the medium from one particle
to another, for there will be a vacuum
between them; and vacuum
is not a material medium. If, on
the contrary, the particles come
into mathematical contact with
their own matter, then, as we have
already shown in our past article,
<pb n='732'/><anchor id='Pg732'/>
they cannot by such a contact
communicate any movement to
each other; and since the transmission
in question should be carried
on by successive communications
of movement, it is plain that
no such transmission will be possible.
And accordingly the theory
of the transmission of actions
through a medium must be rejected.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, elementary actions are
either attractive or repulsive, and
neither of them can be conceived
without intensity and direction.
Now, no direction is possible unless
there be two points distinctly
ubicated in space. And therefore
the action, no matter whether attractive
or repulsive, cannot reach
any material point which is not
distant from the matter of the
agent. But if so, the action is independent
of a medium of communication;
for the material medium,
if it were needed, should lie
between the agent and the patient
in such a manner as to link them
together, and fill by its material
continuity the gap by which they
are separated; and if this were the
case, the medium could not be set
in motion, as its contact with the
agent would exclude distance, and
consequently the possibility of any
direction from the agent to the
medium itself.
</p>

<p>
Some will say that this argument
proves nothing, as the direction of
the action can be sufficiently accounted
for by the direction of the
impulse. But this conclusion is
evidently wrong. For what impulse
can they imagine to proceed
from the sun to the moon? Uncultivated
minds are easily deluded
by unlawful generalizations. They
apply to all actions what they imagine
to agree with some special
phenomenon; and because they see
that in the case of impact there is
an impulse in a certain direction,
they hastily conclude that the direction
of every action depends on the
direction of some impulse. We
may remark that, even in the case
of impact, it is not safe to conclude
that the direction of the movement
will follow the direction of the impulse,
unless the impulse be central,
and the body impinged upon
homogeneous. But leaving aside
the theory of impact, which has nothing
to do with the present question,
what impulse can explain the
continuous resistance of a body to
statical forces? What impulse can
account for the expansive tendency
of gases, and for their continuous
pressure against the recipients in
which they are contained? What
impulse, above all, can account for
universal attraction?

We have mentioned this objection,
not because it needed any scientific
or philosophical discussion,
but simply because it is one of those
notions to which the prejudices of
our infancy give easy admittance
into our minds when we allow ourselves
to be guided, as is often the
case, by our senses and imagination,
in matters pertaining in great part
to the intellectual order. Our mistakes
in the appreciation of the
character and conditions of natural
facts most ordinarily originate in
the unwarranted assumption that,
since the facts are sensible, our
knowledge of them must wholly depend
on our senses; whilst the
truth is that our senses perceive
the movements, but not the actions
which cause them, and therefore
do not see the entirety of the natural
facts, but that portion only
which is most superficial. <q>A fundamental
fact, like an elementary
principle, never fails us,</q> says M.
Faraday, speaking of natural philosophy;
<q>its evidence is always
true; but, on the other hand, we
frequently have to ask, What is the
<pb n='733'/><anchor id='Pg733'/>
fact? often fail in distinguishing
it&mdash;often fail in the very statement
of it&mdash;and mostly overpass or come
short of its true recognition. If
we are subject to mistake in the interpretation
of our mere sense impressions,
we are much more liable
to error when we proceed to deduce
from these impressions (as supplied
to us by our ordinary experience)
the relation of cause and effect; and
the accuracy of our judgment, consequently,
is more endangered.</q><note place='foot'>A Lecture on Mental Education, London, 1855.</note>
</p>

<p>
And now, let no one imagine
that we have any intention of denying
the existence of a material
medium between the celestial bodies.
We only deny that there is
a medium <hi rend='italic'>for transmitting actions</hi>.
Again, we do not deny that when
the earth, for instance, acts upon
the moon, the elements of matter
lying between the earth and the
moon exert their activity on one
another. But we maintain that
their actions are <hi rend='italic'>their own</hi>, and
proceed from their own intrinsic
and permanent power, and not
from any extrinsic agent, and that
such actions are not travelling from
element to element till they reach
the moon. Neither do we deny that
the elements located between the
earth and the moon are also acted
on, for it is clear that gravity must
tend to alter their position in
space; but we hold that the whole
possible effect of gravity on all such
elements is movement, and that
movement is a mere change of
place, and not a transmission of
the action by which it is produced.
How the movements themselves
are communicated from element to
element we shall explain presently.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, from the fact that
the elementary actions are independent
of all material medium of
communication, we infer that bodies,
in attracting and in repelling,
act with equal promptitude, and
without loss of time, whether the
distance of the body acted on be
great or small. Time, in fact, follows
movement; for without movement
there is no succession. Now,
the action of a body does not reach
the distant body through movement&mdash;that
is, through successive
transmission; on the contrary, each
element is, of its own nature, determined
to act <hi rend='italic'>directly</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>immediately</hi>
on every other element existing
in the indefinite sphere of its
activity. Hence a body will indeed
act with a greater intensity at
a less distance, but will not act
sooner than at a greater distance.
There have been scientists who
surmised that the solar attraction
may perhaps need time for reaching
the earth and the planets, and
therefore that the attraction may
reach Mercury in a shorter time than
Jupiter or Neptune. From what
precedes it is manifest that the surmise
is wholly without foundation.
Light needs time for its propagation,
because it consists in a kind
of movement; but attraction, as
we have just remarked, is not
movement, and therefore is not dependent
on time.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>Propagation of movements.</head>

<p>
We
have shown that there is no material
medium for the transmission of
forces, if the word <q>forces</q> is
taken to mean <q>actions</q>; but if
the word is intended to express
<q>movements,</q> then the material
medium is quite indispensable.
We read very frequently in scientific
books that actions are transmitted;
but as this is not true of
the actions themselves, we must
suppose that the phrase is intended
to express only the fact of a progressive
development of the effects
resulting from those actions. In
the same way, when we read that
<pb n='734'/><anchor id='Pg734'/>
actions are conveyed through a
material medium, we interpret this
expression as meaning that a material
medium is strictly required for
the progressive development of the
series of effects due to such actions.
We will explain the fact by an example.
</p>

<p>
If, a mass of air being at rest, a
string is stretched in order to elicit
sound, the vibrations of the string
will be communicated to the neighboring
molecules of air by the action
(not by the movement) of the
string itself; these first molecules,
being thrust out of their position
of equilibrium, will, by their action
(that is, by the exertion of a power
residing in each of their component
elements, not of a power coming
from the string, nor by their movement,
nor by transmitted action),
put in movement a following set of
molecules, and so on indefinitely;
so that, in the whole series of molecular
vibrations, each preceding
molecule causes the motion of the
following one, and causes it by the
exertion of its own powers, not of
any power transmitted. It is evident
that the string cannot give
activity to the molecules of air.
These molecules, whether the string
vibrates or not, have already their
own activity and their own mutual
action; only their actions balance
each other as long as the mass of
air is at rest. But when the string
begins to vibrate, the equilibrium
being broken near it, those molecules
of air which first cease to be
in equilibrium begin to act on the
following molecules with a different
intensity, according to the
change of the molecular distance.
Thus the movement by which the
distance is altered is not the cause,
but the condition, of the phenomenon.
</p>

<p>
What we say of air and sound
applies to any other medium, as
ether with its vibrations, whether
luminous or calorific. The molecules
of ether have their own powers,
and exert them continually,
whether there exists a flame determining
a series of vibrations or
not; but with the flame the first
molecules of ether which are displaced
from their position of equilibrium
will acquire a new local relation
with regard to the following,
and their actions will be of a new
intensity, sufficient to cause the
displacement of the next set of
molecules, and so on. The flame,
then, causes the displacement of the
first set of molecules; the first set
displaced causes the displacement
of the second; the second displaced
causes the displacement of
the third, etc.; each set producing
its own effect by its own inherent
powers, not by the exertion of any
power communicated to them by
the flame, and their displacement
being not a cause, but only a condition,
on which the intensity of
the exertion depends.
</p>

<p>
Hence it appears that in phenomena
of this description it is not
the action, and much less the
power, that is transmitted, but only
the movement, or the formal perturbation
of the equilibrium; and
even the movement is not properly
<hi rend='italic'>transmitted</hi>, but only <hi rend='italic'>propagated</hi>;
because the movement of
each following molecule is not the
identical movement of each preceding
one, but is a movement
really produced in the very impact
of the one on the other, as our
reader must have easily gathered
from our preceding discussion.
And therefore one movement succeeds
another indefinitely, the one
being a condition for the existence
of the other; which constitutes propagation,
not properly transmission.

That evening we went to the
opera, the next night to the theatre;
then came invitations without
number to a series of dinners, <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>matinées</foreign>,
and <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>soirées</foreign> that succeeded
each other without intermission.
I refrain from enumerating them,
for I am writing the history of my
soul rather than my exterior life.
I will merely say, therefore, that
after continuing this course several
weeks, I found myself in a most
singular and unhappy frame of
mind. My thoughts, imagination,
and whole mind became too much
absorbed in the amusements and
pleasures the young are often carried
away with through curiosity
and a superabundance of life and
activity, which might be satisfied
more completely, however, and in
a less dangerous way, than by a
career of pleasure, the almost inevitable
effect of which is to produce
a kind of intoxication. This
intoxication overpowered me to
a certain degree, but it left me,
however, the faculty of realizing
the change that had come over me,
and I felt a painful desire to be
what I once was. I had no peace
of mind. I could not reflect or
pray, even in my short intervals of
leisure, and, in order to avoid the
irksomeness of solitude, I gladly
returned to the round of pleasure
into which my husband liked to
draw me. I had, it is true, the
double safeguard of his love for me
and my indifference to any other
admiration but his. A vague uneasiness
sometimes crossed my
mind like an ominous cloud, but I
did not dream there could possibly
be any danger for either of us in
the enervating atmosphere of flattery
and frivolity which we breathed
more and more constantly.
</p>

<p>
Lorenzo continued to hover
around me in public, or, if he remained
at a distance, to watch me
with an attention that was disagreeable
because it seemed inexplicable.
Nothing could have pleased
me more than to have his eyes always
meeting mine, and to find him
everywhere near enough to speak to;
but this was quite a different thing,
for, even when I was not looking towards
him, I could feel his persistent
eyes fastened on me, and as
soon as I raised my head he would
turn away as if to avoid encountering
my glance. Was it with love
or pride that his eyes thus followed
me? Was it not rather as if he expected
to take me by surprise, or
was mistrustful of me? When this
doubt occurred to my mind, I felt
the blood rush to my face, and love
and pride revolt in my heart.
</p>

<p>
One day we were invited to a
large dinner-party in one of those
magnificent houses in Paris which
have the now rare advantage of a
fine garden. It was past the season
for full dress, and I merely
wore a white muslin trimmed with
lace, and a wreath of flowers whose
colors harmonized with that perfect
<pb n='742'/><anchor id='Pg742'/>
taste shown in everything at Paris.
When I made my appearance,
the whole company united in exclaiming
that my fresh toilet was
wonderfully becoming. Perhaps
they were right. I was of an age
that flowers suited better than jewels,
and my complexion could bear
the light of day without any danger.
The days were now at their
longest, so, in spite of the interminable
length of a grand dinner,
the delicious twilight hour was
not quite gone when we rose from
the table, and all issued forth
through the windows into the garden.
If ever the sight of the green
grass, the leaves on the trees, the
perfume and brilliancy of the flowers,
and the varied hues of the sky
as day declines, are more attractive
and grateful at one time than another,
it is certainly when contrasted
with the stifling atmosphere, the
air impregnated with the odor of
dishes, and the brilliant artificial
light, at a grand dinner in mid-summer.
Therefore it was with inexpressible
relief and an almost
child-like joy I flew down the steps
into the garden as soon as the
master of the house left my movements
free, and strolled along the
broad alley that divided the lawn,
inhaling with delight the freshness
of the balmy air.... My life of
pleasure had never quenched the
ardent love of solitude that sometimes
came over me, and I now
longed to be alone. I desired this
the more because I felt uneasy
about a new change in Lorenzo's
manner, and wished to reflect undisturbed
on the inference I should
draw from it.
</p>

<p>
For the first time since our arrival
at Paris he had not, to my
knowledge, watched one of my
movements, though I had received
more flattery that day, perhaps,
than ever before.... During the
dinner he appeared devoted to his
neighbors&mdash;on one side, a lady who
was still beautiful, though no longer
in the bloom of youth; and on the
other, a young gentleman with a
thoughtful, striking face, who grew
animated whenever Lorenzo addressed
him, and seemed to reply
with much interest. I was told
that the former was Mme. de B&mdash;&mdash;,
the other the young Count Gilbert
de Kergy, <q>a great traveller also,</q>
added the master of the house,
beside whom I was seated. <q>And
it was solely the hope of meeting
the Duca di Valenzano that induced
him to accept my invitation to
dine with us to-day. He does not
care for the <foreign rend='italic'>grand monde</foreign>; and when
he returns from one of his extensive
journeys, he shuts himself up at
home, or plunges into the charitable
world, which is another <foreign rend='italic'>grand
monde</foreign> little suspected by strangers
who only come to Paris for a
time.</q>
</p>

<p>
All this might perhaps have interested
me at some other time,
but my mind was now occupied in
trying to ascertain the reality of the
change I had remarked. It was
now my turn to give sly glances towards
the other side of the table,
but I did not once detect Lorenzo
looking towards me. And yet it
was not owing to the interest he
took in the conversation. How
many times I had seen him apparently
absorbed in conversation,
while a rapid glance of the eye convinced
me he had been constantly
attentive to every movement I
made. There was nothing of this
kind to-day. I knew him too well
not to perceive the difference, but
I did not know what to think of it,
or if I had any reason to rejoice
at it.
</p>

<p>
These thoughts beset me during
<pb n='743'/><anchor id='Pg743'/>
the trifling conversation that varies
the <foreign rend='italic'>ennui</foreign> of a large dinner, and
even prevented me from perceiving
that our host was a gentleman of
superior intelligence, and profiting
by it. Before leaving the table, I
stealthily turned my eyes once more
in the direction they had so often
taken within an hour. It was evident
that Lorenzo did not trouble
himself any more about me to-day
than any other husband about his
wife in public. But this time I
perceived his young neighbor looking
at me rather attentively, though
with a look of seriousness almost
amounting to austerity, very different
from the glances so often encountered
in the world which always
made me lower my eyes. His
inspired me with a kind of sympathy,
and did not give me the slightest
embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
I had, however, no opportunity
for reflection during my walk, for I
was almost immediately surrounded
by friends, and I soon turned back
to hunt for Lorenzo. Daylight
was almost gone, which made it
difficult to recognize any one; but
at last I discovered him on the
steps by means of his lofty stature
and noble features, which were distinctly
defined against the light of
the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salon</foreign> within. Near him sat his
next neighbor at dinner, holding a
fan in her hand, and talking in an
animated manner. Lorenzo appeared
to be listening without making
any attempt to reply. Once or
twice he turned his head towards
the garden. He was looking for
me, perhaps....
</p>

<p>
It had now grown entirely too
dark to distinguish any one around
me. I was standing motionless near
a bench on which sat two or three
gentlemen talking together.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mme. de B&mdash;&mdash; looks almost as
handsome as ever this evening,</q>
said one of them. <q>One would
really think she was trying to regain
her ascendency!...</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It would be very difficult, however,
to supplant that lovely, golden-haired
Sicilian.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Impossible, certainly, in the
eyes of any other man; but in those
of her husband, who knows?</q>
</p>

<p>
This was one of those speeches
that are always flying at random,
and striking the ear on every side
in the world&mdash;speeches which one
hears without listening to, but
which weaken the moral sense, as
physical diseases are produced by
breathing dangerous miasmata too
frequently. Since I had lived in
this atmosphere many things of a
similar nature had been said in my
presence. Alas! it was sufficient
to hear Lorenzo and Lando's conversation
to learn how far light
words of this kind can go. I therefore
tried to attach no importance
to the gossip I had thus accidentally
overheard. Even if Lorenzo did
formerly pay homage to this now
somewhat faded beauty, why should
I care? That did not trouble me
for the moment. My only anxiety
was to ascertain if his happening to
meet her was the cause of the
change I had observed, or if I must
seek some other. In a word, ought
I to be anxious or to rejoice?
</p>

<p>
Having escaped, in the almost
utter darkness, from those who
tried to detain me, I was slowly advancing
towards the steps when I
suddenly met Lorenzo.... He
was in search of me, for he had on
his arm my thin mantle of white
cashmere, which he wrapped around
my shoulders. I joyfully seized
hold of his arm, and said in a low
tone: <q>Pray do not go in yet, Lorenzo.
Let us walk awhile in this
beautiful covered alley.</q>
</p>

<p>
He began to laugh. <q>That
<pb n='744'/><anchor id='Pg744'/>
would be very sentimental,</q> said
he, <q>for people who are no longer
in their honey-moon; but no matter,
I consent. <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Honi soit qui mal y pense.</foreign>
Besides, I see yonder an illuminated
tent, where, I am told, they are
preparing a musical surprise for us.
Let us go in that direction.</q>
</p>

<p>
We walked a short distance without
speaking. There was nothing
absolutely calculated to wound me
in what he said, but his light, indifferent
tone was not what I longed
to hear. Amid all the excitement
of fashionable society, I felt
that his love constituted the only
happiness of my life; and if I had
supposed that to be the only cause
of his vigilance and anxiety concerning
me, I should never have
sought to escape from it. But I
had been doubtful about this, and
felt so still. And I was too open,
too confiding, and perhaps too
petulant, to remain in doubt any
longer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us stop here, Lorenzo,</q> I
said when we arrived at the end of
the covered walk. <q>I see people
coming this way. We can follow
them into the tent, and it will be
supposed we came with the crowd.</q>
</p>

<p>
In fact, a brilliant <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>soirée</foreign> succeeded
the dinner. The <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salons</foreign> and
garden were filled with company.
The light from the tent extended
to the place where we were standing,
though we were out of sight.
I sat down on a bench against a
tree, and Lorenzo took a seat beside
me.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have a question to ask you,</q>
said I suddenly. <q>Promise to give
me a sincere reply.</q>
</p>

<p>
He seemed surprised. He raised
his eyebrows slightly, and his smiling
face became clouded.
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not much like to be questioned,
Ginevra, I forewarn you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you always seem to like
to have me answer your questions.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, but without depending on
it; for I know how to question and
obtain an answer without giving
you the trouble to reply.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And is that why you look at me
instead of speaking, and your eyes
are always following me so attentively?</q>
</p>

<p>
He smiled, and made no reply
for a while.
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps that has been the cause
of my doing so till to-day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Till to-day?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; since you ask me, I confess
it without any hesitation. Love
does not always, among its privileges,
possess the faculty of seeing
clearly. Therefore I have been
mistrustful of mine, and have not
allowed it to influence me in the
least in studying you.</q>
</p>

<p>
I made a slight gesture of surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen, Ginevra. One never
knows what a young soldier is till
his first battle. Neither can one
tell what a young woman of your
age is till she appears on the terrible
battle-field of the fashionable
world. But if I have any faculty,
it is, I believe, that of not being
deceived in a study of this kind.
Be assured, Ginevra, that from this
time I shall watch you no more.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then, Lorenzo,</q> said I, somewhat
hurt, <q>you really watched me
through suspicion, and all this time
was necessary to convince you I
am to be trusted?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wished to see you under fire,</q>
said he, resuming his jesting tone.
<q>Do not complain of this, ma
belle Ginevra. You have come out
of the trial victorious&mdash;victorious
to such a degree that, though I
thought you more charming to-day
than ever, I have not once thought
of watching you. And yet,</q> continued
<pb n='745'/><anchor id='Pg745'/>
he in a tone he tried to render
playful, but which was bitter in
spite of himself, <q>those flowers
that are so becoming to you are
not all calculated to reassure me.</q>
And plucking a red carnation from
my wreath, he held it up before me
with a smile that seemed cruel, and
was about to put it in his button-hole
when, pale as death, I
snatched it from his hand, and
threw it as far as I could.
</p>

<p>
<q>Lorenzo!</q> I said in a trembling
voice, <q>you are ungenerous!...
and you are very unjust!...</q>
</p>

<p>
I should have done better to say,
as well as think, that he did not
know what he was doing. No; he
little knew what had taken place in
my soul since the day he thus recalled,
which was so sanguinary, so
fatal in its results. No; he could
not conceive the intolerable pain
he gave me by thus suddenly reviving
my regret, my sorrow, and my
shame!...
</p>

<p>
He could read my heart to a certain
extent, but how far he was&mdash;alas!
how incapable he was&mdash;of
penetrating to the bottom of my
soul, and fully comprehending, or
even suspecting, the radical change
which that one day had wrought in
my nature.
</p>

<p>
He saw with surprise and alarm
my agitation and the sudden paleness
of my face, and endeavored to
calm me; but I noticed he was at
once anxious and annoyed about
the emotion he had excited.
</p>

<p>
I made a violent effort to regain
my self-control, and soon succeeded
in allaying the throbbing of my
heart. But I felt as if an icy wind
had crossed my path, chilling too
soon the opening flowers of my
dawning happiness, and causing
them to droop their heads.
</p>

<index index='toc'/>
<index index='pdf'/>
<head>XIV.</head>

<p>
From that day Lorenzo, as he
promised, ceased to manifest any
interest in what I did in society.
But this apparent confidence afforded
me no pleasure. I remained
painfully wounded at what had
passed between us. I considered
his suspicions even more humiliating
than those of my father, and
began to feel that the fault I had
so greatly deplored had not merited
so long and cruel a chastisement.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, I was only relieved
from the anxiety caused by his
vigilance to experience another
which was soon to increase and reveal
to me at last my true destiny.
It did not, in fact, require a long
time to discover that Lorenzo's
new attitude was sometimes less
like confidence than indifference.
It frequently happened that I
searched a long time for him in the
different <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salons</foreign> where we were accustomed
to spend all our evenings,
without being able to find
him. One day I perceived him
talking in a very animated manner
with Mme. de B&mdash;&mdash;, and, when I
approached, I fancied there was a
slight expression of displeasure in
his face, which, though promptly
concealed, was sufficient to cause
me a painful sensation of embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
When we were alone, however, I
found him unchanged. His manner
towards me had lost nothing
of its charm; he seemed as affectionate
as ever, and yet an invisible
barrier had risen between us, which
was constantly increasing, and I
began to experience a feeling of
solitude that was especially painful
in society, but from which I was
nowhere completely exempt.
</p>

<pb n='746'/><anchor id='Pg746'/>

<p>
But the success of my first appearance
in the world had now
given way to that of fashion. The
arrival of some foreign prince,
whose name I no longer remember,
prolonged the gay season at Paris
this year, and one reunion succeeded
another as if it were carnival
time. There was not one to which
I was not invited, and, though an
undeniable need of rest began to
overpower the feverish activity
that for some time had come over
me, I was unable to stop, for I
began to perceive that a quiet,
tranquil life was insupportable to
Lorenzo unless in his studio. Out
of that, he wished to be incessantly
in motion, and, as he could not now
seriously resume his artist life, he
gave himself up entirely to that of
the world, and was not yet indifferent
to the pleasure of having me
accompany him.
</p>

<p>
It was therefore impossible for
me to extricate myself from the
giddy round of which I had grown
so weary, and I sometimes envied
those who were satisfied with the
mere pleasure of attracting attention.
I felt astonished then, and I
still am, at the wonderful part played
by vanity in these gayeties, which
are so different to those who participate
in them from what they
seem to the crowd who are excluded.
The music, the dancing, the
splendid apartments, the gayety of
youth requisite to enjoy all this,
and, to crown the whole, the pleasure
of meeting those who are dear,
are the chief attractions and keenest
enjoyments which cause those
who have the power of exhausting
them to be envied by all who are
deprived of them. If this were
really all, such a life would be ennobled
to a certain degree in my
eyes, for its dangers and its pleasures
would at least be commensurate
with the love and the disapprobation
of which they are the object.
But the seductions of the world consist
chiefly in the satisfaction of
eclipsing others, and the intoxication
it causes is almost always produced,
not by the pleasure it gives,
but by the vanity of those who
mingle in it. This seems strange
when we reflect upon it, and we
can see, without rising very high,
that not only happiness, but pleasure,
and even amusement, can find
a better source; and consequently
those who really possess these envied
blessings are the people who
are supposed to be the most debarred
from them.
</p>

<p>
As for me, I was no longer light-hearted,
but I tried to appear so
in society; for the sad expression
I could not always disguise had
excited some observations that
wounded my pride.
</p>

<p>
<q>What! the fair Ginevra really
melancholy?</q> said Lando Landi,
sitting down beside me one evening
at a concert, and speaking in the
familiar tone authorized by his relationship,
but which was none the
less displeasing. <q>I have always
denied it, because you are so invariably
cheerful when I see you out
of this everlasting din, as I do
every day. I only supposed you a
little weary of so gay a life&mdash;a thing
conceivable, even in your case, for
one gets tired of everything, even
of turning people's heads; but this
evening you really have the air of a
tragic muse.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am a little fatigued, that is
all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Listen to me, cousin, and do
not treat me so badly. I see you do
not like me, which proves I am not
self-conceited; and I am not angry
with you, which proves I am not
malicious. Moreover, I greatly admire
and love you, and yet (give
<pb n='747'/><anchor id='Pg747'/>
me some credit for this) I do not
pay court to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, Lando, no more of such
jests, but come to the point.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was about to beg you to show
some confidence in me. You are
sad, and I will tell you why: you
have heard some nonsensical gossip
about Lorenzo. Now, cousin, let
me tell you....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What gossip?</q> I asked, turning
red with an air of displeasure.
</p>

<p>
<q>You understand me perfectly
well. I am certain I tell you nothing
new. It may seem presuming
to speak of this, but I must justify
Lorenzo. Believe what I say, and
do not attach any importance to
a passing politeness in memory of
former times, which means nothing,
and really does not, on my word of
honor, merit such a flash from your
beautiful eyes.</q>
</p>

<p>
He had indeed found the means
of making them flame up.
</p>

<p>
<q>Really, Lando,</q> said I haughtily,
<q>it would serve you right if I
never spoke to you again.</q>
</p>

<p>
But he was evidently so seriously
astonished that I saw I was
wrong. He had been presuming
without knowing it or intending it.
I therefore continued in a milder
tone:
</p>

<p>
<q>I assure you, you are absolutely
mistaken. I am neither sad nor
anxious, ... only a little <foreign rend='italic'>ennuyée</foreign>,
that is all. And to-night I am
sleepy, and wish to return home as
soon as possible. Give me your
arm, and let us go in search of Lorenzo.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is not much after midnight,</q>
he said; <q>you must really remain
a while longer to hear the last two
pieces.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I tell you I have had
enough of it. But if you wish to
remain here, you need not feel
obliged to escort me. The first
person I meet will render me that
service.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Ma cher!</foreign></q> said he, rising and
shaking his head, as he concluded
to give me his arm.
</p>

<p>
We began our voyage of discovery
through the long row of <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salons</foreign>,
but could not find Lorenzo anywhere.
Lando said nothing, but I
noticed he cast a quick, mistrustful
glance around every room we entered,
and it occurred to me he had not
told the truth, but merely wished
to reassure me when he knew Lorenzo
was having a <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>tête-à-tête</foreign> it was
as humiliating for me to be ignorant
of as to discover. Lando had
touched a sorer spot than I was
willing he should see. For in spite
of an apparently very frank explanation
on this point from Lorenzo
himself a few days before, suspicion
had entered my heart, and I was in
constant need of being reassured.
Was not this acknowledging I already
had reason to tremble?
</p>

<p>
At length we arrived at the last
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>salon</foreign>. Lorenzo was not there.
There was only a small room beyond,
not as well lighted as the
rest.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is the library,</q> explained
Lando in his way; <q>or, at least, a
cabinet full of books, where no one
ever goes.</q>
</p>

<p>
An almost imperceptible movement
of his arm made me feel he
wished to prevent me from entering.
This was enough to induce
me to go straight to the door, where
I stopped short, at once reassured
and amazed. Four men were there
by themselves, sitting around a
card-table with a green covering.
Two of them were playing, and
Lorenzo was one of them; the
others followed the game with the
most intense interest. I remained
leaning against the door, motionless,
and my eyes fastened on him.
<pb n='748'/><anchor id='Pg748'/>
Was that really Lorenzo?...
What a change in his countenance!...
What a strange expression
in his mobile face! He
did not perceive me, and I felt that
my voice would have sounded in
his ear in vain. He neither saw
nor heard anything around him.
His looks, his attention, his mind,
and his whole being seemed absorbed
in the cards he held in his hand.
He was calm, but his slightly-compressed
eyebrows showed that luck
was against him.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes he drew a roll
of gold pieces from his pocket, and
threw them on the table. His opponent
rose, but Lorenzo remained
in his seat, and began a new game
with one of those who had been
watching the old one.
</p>

<p>
<q>Take a seat here,</q> said Lando,
leading me towards one of the sofas
in the room where we were. <q>I
am going to tell Lorenzo you are
waiting for him. Do not go in
yourself.</q>
</p>

<p>
I made a sign of assent, and for
the first time gave Lando credit for
some tact. His usually smiling
face had, moreover, an air of anxious
solicitude that not only surprised
me, but redoubled the strange, unexpected
shock I had just experienced.
He went into the next
room, and, after waiting a long time,
I at last saw him come out; but he
was alone.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is impossible to speak to him
till the end of the game,</q> he said in
a tone of vexation. Then, after a
moment's silence, he added with a
forced laugh: <q>My dear cousin,
you would have done much better
to follow my advice and wait for
Lorenzo in the concert-room instead
of coming here after him.
But since you persisted in doing so,
allow me to give you one bit of
advice, now you have caught him
falling into his old bad habit
again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Again?</q> I said with an air of
surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, yes.... For a year he
did not touch a card, he told me,
for he well knew that for him the
mere touch was like a spark that
kindles a fire. He vowed&mdash;not to
play moderately, for he is incapable
of moderation in anything&mdash;but
never to touch a card again, and he
expressed great satisfaction some
days since that he had kept his
promise so faithfully. But to-day
he has broken it. Who knows
what will happen to-morrow?
Make use, therefore, of the influence
you still have over him; use all the
persuasive powers you possess to
induce him to resolve once more
on a wise course. It is a thing, you
may be sure, that threatens your
happiness, as well as his, a thousand
times more than all the fair ones
in the past, present, or future who
should attempt to rival you!</q>
</p>

<p>
In spite of all that was displeasing
in Lando's manner, language,
and sentiments, and even in the expressions
he made use of in giving
me this advice, I felt it was dictated
by sincere interest, and it touched
me. I felt weighed down by this
new trouble. This was a fear I had
never experienced before. It was
absolutely foreign to everything
that had crossed my mind. Was
this to live, love, and be happy?
Everything around me looked dark,
and the night seemed to penetrate
to my very soul.
</p>

<p>
The time I had to wait seemed
interminable. The concert was
over, the rooms were growing empty,
and we were to be the last. I
rose with an impatience I could no
longer control, and went again to
the cabinet. Lorenzo was rising
from the table just as I entered.
<pb n='749'/><anchor id='Pg749'/>
I saw him slip another roll of
money into his opponent's hands.
Then he came towards me with his
usual expression. It was evident
he had no suspicion of my having
been so near him for more than an
hour.
</p>

<p>
<q>Excuse me, Ginevra,</q> said he.
<q>What! is the concert over? And
you had to search for me?... It
is unpardonable; but I had no idea
they would get to the end of that
interminable programme so early.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But it is nearly two o'clock,</q>
said I.
</p>

<p>
He glanced towards the clock,
and looked surprised. Lando,
meanwhile, had hurried away to get
my cloak; but he soon returned
with it, saying the carriage was
waiting for us. I entered it with
Lorenzo, after giving my hand
more cordially to his cousin than I
had ever done before.
</p>

<p>
On the way home Lorenzo, after
a long silence, thought proper to
explain that he had got tired of the
concert, and for amusement had
had recourse to a game of <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>écarté</foreign>.
Lando's words were still in my
ears. My heart, too, was filled
with inexpressible anxiety and profound
affection for this dear partner
of my life who was so charming
in manner, and whom it would
have been so sweet to love in
peace! I leaned my head against
his shoulder, and, passing my arm
through his, said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Lorenzo, if I take the liberty
of giving you one word of advice,
will you follow it? If I beg you to
make me one promise&mdash;a promise
that will render me happy&mdash;will
you not grant it?</q>
</p>

<p>
He made so abrupt a movement
that I was almost frightened. But
he immediately resumed his self-control,
and, softly kissing my
hand and forehead, said in a tone
that was not rude, but which seemed
to forbid all reply:
</p>

<p>
<q>Ginevra, I think I told you the
other day that I do not like to be
questioned, and I now tell you that
I like advice still less, and, above
all, I cannot bear to make promises.
So let this warning suffice. Avoid
these three shoals, if you wish to remain
in my eyes what I now consider
you&mdash;the most charming of
women.</q>

The following day was Sunday.
Notwithstanding so fatiguing an
evening, the lateness of the hour
when I retired, and the restless
night that followed, I was ready for
Mass at the usual hour. But for
the first time since my marriage
Lorenzo sent me word not to wait
for him. Of course I had never
been under any great illusion as to
his religious sentiments. I supposed
that habit, rather than piety, induced
him to accompany me to
church; but I was far from suspecting
that he had hitherto made it a
point to do so because he thought
it necessary to keep an eye on me
there as well as elsewhere. Above
all, I little expected the habit to be
laid aside as soon as he was reassured
or became interested in
something else. I consoled myself
on this occasion by thinking
he would go to a later Mass; and
for the first time I went out alone
and on foot, the distance being so
short between our hotel in the Rue
de Rivoli and the Church of S.
Roch.
</p>

<p>
The life I had led for two months
was not precisely adapted to dispose
my soul for prayer. Besides, accustomed
<pb n='750'/><anchor id='Pg750'/>
as I had been to the
churches of Italy, those at Paris
seemed destitute of all beauty, and
I found it difficult to get used to
so different an aspect. But other
impressions soon modified this.
The goodness and piety that so
thoroughly impregnated the atmosphere
which surrounded my childhood
were rather the spirit of our
family than of the land that had
providentially given me birth. And
yet there is, in Sicily, as well as all
Southern Italy, a great deal of faith,
though it cannot be denied that, at
this time, great moral relaxation
and religious indifference were too
prevalent, especially among those
who belonged to the upper classes.
There, more than anywhere else
even, holy souls led hidden lives,
and edification was rather to be
found in the obscurity of certain
firesides than in the world at large,
or even in the usages of public worship.
All the religious exercises
of our family were performed in the
chapel of the old palace we occupied.
This chapel was spacious,
richly ornamented, and architecturally
beautiful. We not only
heard Mass there on Sundays, but
every day, and two or three times a
week Don Placido gave us an instructive,
edifying discourse. My
father, mother, Livia, Ottavia,
Mario (who, in spite of his faults,
retained his respect for holy things),
and several faithful old servants
constituted the attentive, devout
congregation. My childhood was
not wanting in any of those influences
that have so powerful an effect
on after-life. Ottavia often
took Livia and myself to the evening
Benediction in one of the neighboring
churches, and my heart still
throbs at the remembrance of the
pious transport with which I knelt
before the illuminated tabernacle
on which stood the monstrance.
The church used to be filled solely
by people of the humbler classes,
even on festivals. It was a rare
thing to find a single person belonging
to the upper classes. What
struck me, therefore, above all, at
Paris, was the complete difference
of the churches in this respect. I
was at first even more surprised
than edified. For if I had often
remarked the absence of the wealthy
in Sicily, here I was struck with
the absence of the poor. I looked
around for the people clothed in
rags, whose fervor had so often redoubled
mine, and did not like to
feel that I was separated from them.
This separation is much more marked
where the custom of private
chapels has been established.
Christian equality calls the rich and
great to the foot of the altar, no
less than the poor and lowly; and
if they do not all meet there, whether
in France or Italy, we cannot
blame those whose attendance at
church is an example to the absent,
whatever rank they may belong to.
</p>

<p>
But to return to this Sunday
morning. I knelt down and heard
Mass with much less distraction
than usual. I was, it is true, rather
sad than devout at the time, but I
prayed more fervently than I had
done for a long time, and, when I
slowly and reluctantly left the
church, the inner soul, that resounds
like a lyre under the divine
hand, had received a slight touch,
and for the first time for a long
while I felt the movement of one
of those hidden chords that cannot
be sounded without causing all the
others to vibrate.
</p>

<p>
As I approached the door of the
church, I noticed a young girl
kneeling on a chair, whose face did
not seem wholly unknown to me.
She held a purse in her hand, and
<pb n='751'/><anchor id='Pg751'/>
was soliciting contributions for orphans.
I deposited my offering,
and received her smiling thanks in
return. As I passed on, I heard
her whisper my name to a lady of
noble and distinguished appearance
beside her (whom I supposed to be
her mother), who, with her eyes
fastened on her book, had not observed
me. As I went on, I recollected
having met this pretty girl
two or three times in company, but
did not know her name. I felt surprised
that she should know mine,
though this often happens to strangers
who are pointed out as objects
of curiosity, while they only know
a few of those around them.
</p>

<p>
I had no time, however, to dwell
on this accidental meeting, or
quietly enjoy the impressions left
by the services at church; for Lorenzo's
first words immediately revived
all the recollections of the
morning.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are late, Ginevra,</q> said he.
<q>It is half-past eleven. Breakfast
is waiting, and I am in a hurry.</q>
</p>

<p>
We took seats at the table in silence,
but he soon resumed:
</p>

<p>
<q>You have scarcely time to dress.
Have you forgotten that we are
going to the races? Lando Landi
is to come for us before one
o'clock.</q>
</p>

<p>
Yes, I had completely forgotten
it. I felt an earnest desire to withdraw
from the engagement. I
wanted one day of peace and quiet
repose. I felt the need of drinking
in more deeply the breath of pure
air I had just tasted. Could I not
have a few hours to myself? Must
I at once go where I should inhale
a different atmosphere? And what
an atmosphere!...
</p>

<p>
Seeing that I remained silent
and had a pensive air, he said in
an impatient tone:
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, Ginevra, what is it?
What have you to tell me or ask
me?...</q>
</p>

<p>
I replied without any circumlocution:
<q>I have nothing to say, except
that I am tired to death of
those races, and beg you to excuse
me from accompanying you to-day.</q>
</p>

<p>
His face immediately cleared up.
<q>Is that all?</q> said he. <q>As to that,
you are at perfect liberty to do as
you please. You may be sure,</q>
continued he, laughing, <q>that I
shall only contradict you on great
occasions.... But what will you
do with yourself this afternoon, if
you do not go to the races?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall do like everybody else
in France&mdash;go to Vespers.</q>
</p>

<p>
He gave a derisive laugh that
was horrible.
</p>

<p>
<q>Everybody else, do you say?
It would be very difficult to tell how
many in Paris even go to Mass!</q>
</p>

<p>
I looked at him, as he said this.
He understood my meaning, and
appeared displeased.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, Ginevra,</q> said he in an
ill-humored manner, <q>are you going
to insist that I must always
agree with you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By no means, Lorenzo, you
know very well.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But you did not like it because
you had to go to church without
me this morning.</q>
</p>

<p>
I hesitated an instant, but at last
replied with some emotion:
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course I love to have you
with me wherever I go, and more
especially there; but it would be
better, however, for you to go to
church always without me than
ever to go <emph>solely</emph> for me.</q>
</p>

<p>
This reply increased his displeasure,
and he said in a tone he had
never used before:
</p>

<p>
<q>Unfortunately, the truth is, my
dear child, if I should consult my
own inclinations, I might perhaps
never go at all.</q>
</p>

<pb n='752'/><anchor id='Pg752'/>

<p>
Tears came into my eyes, and
my heart ached with the strongest
feeling of grief I had ever experienced!...
</p>

<p>
O my God!... I must have
had some love for thee, even at that
time, since the very thought of any
one's not loving thee caused me so
much pain!...
</p>

<p>
Lorenzo's tone, look, and whole
manner not only showed his utter
indifference, but the complete incredulity
he felt. I had never suspected
it before, because it was
something foreign to my experience.
I knew it was possible to
violate the law of God, but did not
know it could be denied. I understood
lukewarmness and negligence,
for I had seen both in
others as well as in him; but I had
never before encountered lack of repentance
and ignorance of duty.
This cold denial of any love for
God and of all belief in him Lorenzo,
of course, had not expressly
declared, but it had been betrayed
by his manner doubtless even more
than he would have wished. With
all the inconsistencies of my character
and the faults of my age, he
must have seen that I had too lively
and profound a faith not to be
displeased at anything that jarred
on it, and heretofore he had been
circumspect without being hypocritical.
</p>

<p>
He saw the effect he had produced,
and, as he had not become
indifferent to me, he regretted it;
but he knew he could not at once
repair his mistake, and contented
himself for the moment by trying
to divert my mind from it by a
change of subject. And I likewise
felt it would be better to talk of
something else. This prudence
was by no means natural to my
disposition, but I began to understand
his. Besides, his injunctions
of the evening before were
still too recent to be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
The conversation did not last
long, for Lando, punctual to his
engagement, arrived at half-past
twelve with a beaming face, a flower
in his button-hole, and in his
hand an enormous bunch of violets
destined for me.
</p>

<p>
<q>What!</q> he exclaimed when
he learned my intentions for the
afternoon.... <q>But that is impossible!
Not go to the races? Why,
you must. Remain at home when
the weather is the finest in the
world? I never heard of such a
thing.... Deprive me of the
pleasure of taking you in my <foreign rend='italic'>calèche</foreign>,
and making everybody envy
me?... That is the most cruel
caprice that ever entered a woman's
head!...</q>
</p>

<p>
Here Lorenzo left the room an
instant to look for his hat, and
Lando suddenly began in another
tone: <q>I am in earnest, cousin.
You would do much better to
go.</q>
</p>

<p>
What did he mean? I remained
doubtful and troubled, but Lorenzo
immediately returned, and I had
no time for reflection. As they
were leaving the room, my husband
approached, and, taking me
by the hand, looked at me with an
expression his eyes now and then
assumed, and which always dispersed,
as by some enchantment,
the clouds that rose too often between
us. He slightly caressed
my cheek with the glove in his
hand, and whispered with a smile:
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, Ginevra mia, do not be
angry. Let me see you smile
again.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then turning towards Lando,
<q>It is not yet one o'clock,</q> he
said. <q>Let us start, and, before
going to the Bois de Boulogne, we
will stop at the Madeleine.</q>
</p>

<pb n='753'/><anchor id='Pg753'/>

<p>
His looks, as well as his words,
allayed my anxiety; but a thousand
different ideas crossed my mind,
and after they were gone I remained
thoughtfully leaning on the
balustrade of my balcony, where I
followed them with my eyes to the
end of the street, wondering what
Lando meant, and if I had really
done wrong not to accompany
them.
</p>

<p>
The weather at that time was
fine. The clearness of the sky, as
well as the verdure of the trees, attracted
my attention more than the
aspect of the street, and of the garden
already filled with the crowd
of animated, happy, and gayly-dressed
people, that give every
pleasant summer day at Paris the
appearance of a festival. But I
was absorbed in my own thoughts,
and looked at it all without noticing
anything. I had a vague feeling
that, among the dangers that
seemed to encompass me in the new
life into which I had been thrown,
there were two I had special
reason to dread. The first&mdash;the
greatest&mdash;would have broken my
heart, and on that I could not dwell
for an instant.... The second
threatened the loss of our property,
and would diminish our income, if
not absolutely ruin us. This, too
was alarming, but much less so than
the other in my eyes, though just
the contrary in Lando's estimation,
if I read him aright. After considerable
reflection, I concluded
that he merely referred to something
of the same nature he had alluded
to the evening before, and
I put it aside to ask myself with far
deeper anxiety if I had really had
a glimpse of Lorenzo's heart, as he
looked at me on leaving the room,
or whether he was playing a part,
and deliberately deceiving me. The
heavenly expression that sometimes
beamed from his eyes always
inspired me with a confidence in
him that was equal to my affection.
I had just experienced its effect.
The look, however, was so transient
that it rather resembled the reflection
of a distant light than any
actual, real feeling. Whereas his
mocking laugh and the tone that
to-day for the first time accompanied
it were&mdash;alas! I could not
doubt it&mdash;the expression of his real
sentiments, and this contradiction
terrified me.... He seemed to
possess two natures, and my head
grew weary in trying to decide
which of the two was his real one&mdash;a
question I frequently had occasion
to ask afterwards, and to wait a
long time for the reply&mdash;as doubtful
to him then as it was to myself....
</p>

<p>
I left the window, and, buried in
an arm-chair, I allowed the time to
pass away in reflections of this kind
without opening the book I held in
my hand, or noticing the gradual
obscurity of the sky, that a short
time before had been so clear. It
was not threatening enough, however,
to hinder me from going on
foot to Vespers, which it was nearly
time for, the hour not being as
late at S. Roch's as elsewhere. I
started without any delay, giving
orders for my carriage to be at the
church door at the end of the service.
</p>

<p>
The salutary impressions of the
morning and the excessive anxiety
and sadness that I afterwards experienced
had somewhat counteracted
the more or less unhealthy
influences that result from a continued
life of pleasure. I was now
in that frame of mind when it is
easy to collect one's thoughts;
when the soul, so to speak, flies to
the first place of refuge in which it
is sure of repose.... Who has
<pb n='754'/><anchor id='Pg754'/>
not experienced the strange, mysterious,
refreshing influence of
prayer, even when mute and inarticulate?...
Who has not, in this
way, laid down for an instant all
his sorrows, all his fears, all his sufferings,
and afterwards taken up the
load again with a renewed strength
that seemed to have lightened the
burden?...
</p>

<p>
I had suffered but little at that
time in comparison with what life
still had in reserve for me. But
after a while we learn to suffer, and
in this science, as in all others, it is
the beginning one always finds the
most difficult. A fearful storm, it
is true, had assailed the first flower
of my spring-time, and spread darkness
and gloom over the heavens
of my sixteenth year; but spring-time
and the sun returned, and at
an age when others only begin life
I was commencing mine the second
time. But this new life of happiness
was, I now felt, threatened in
a thousand ways. Apprehension,
a worse torture than sadness; a
vague, undefined fear, more difficult
to endure than the woes it anticipates;
the uncertainty, doubt,
and suspicion, so much more intolerable
to one of my nature than
any positive suffering, rendered my
heart heavy and depressed, and I
felt it would be a relief to weep
as well as to pray.
</p>

<p>
I knelt on the only vacant chair
in the church, and remained a long
time motionless, my face buried in
my hands, unable to give utterance
to my wants, but knowing God
could read my heart, as, when we
meet a friend after a long separation,
we are often silent merely because
we have so much to communicate,
and know not where to
begin. In this attitude I heard
Vespers sung for the first time in
my life, this office of the church
being, as is well known, much less
frequently used in the south of
Italy than in other places. I have
already mentioned the public religious
observances of my childhood.
I had, therefore, never heard
Vespers chanted in this way. The
voices of the choristers were harmonious,
and the responses were no
less so. A large number of the
congregation joined in the chant.
There was something monotonous
rather than musical in it, but it was
more musical than reading, and it
produced a strangely soothing influence
on me. I laid aside all
thought of myself, and attentively
followed the admirable lines of the
Psalmist; and when the Magnificat
was intoned, I rose with the whole
congregation to chant this divine
hymn with a sensation of joy and
hope that, for the moment, made
me forget the painful impressions I
felt when I entered beneath these
arches now resounding with its
words....
</p>

<p>
Benediction followed, recalling
the earliest, dearest remembrances
of my childhood, and increasing the
emotion I already felt. When the
monstrance containing the divine
Host was placed above the altar, I
lost all thought of where I was. I
forgot whether it was Paris, Rome,
or Messina, and whether the arches
above me were those of some magnificent
church, or some humble chapel,
or a mere oratory like that in
which I had prayed from my childhood.
What difference did it make?
The sun shines everywhere alike, and
diffuses equal light in all places.
How much more truly shines
throughout the whole Catholic
world the living, uncreated Light,
present on all our altars! Time
and place were forgotten. I was
once more with my beloved mother,
once more with Livia, my
<pb n='755'/><anchor id='Pg755'/>
sweet, saintly sister, and the faithful
Ottavia; and when, at the
end of one of those hymns that
are usually sung before the Blessed
Sacrament, a young voice,
pure and clear, uttered the word
<hi rend='italic'>Patria</hi>,<note place='foot'>In the <hi rend='italic'>O Salutaris Hostia!</hi></note> it seemed at that moment
to have a double meaning, and designate,
not only my earthly, but
my heavenly country.

Those were terrible days. Even
the faithful quailed, and asked each
other timidly whether it was possible
that God's enemies had at
last prevailed, and that the Rock had
been shaken and the Word passed
away. Voltaire had come and
done his work, and gone, leaving a
new generation behind him to fight
the devil's cause, to flaunt his
standard over Christendom, to revile
<q>the Galilean,</q> and wage war
against his church&mdash;the subtle, deadly,
persevering war of envious hatred,
conquered impotence, malignant
fury. There was a shout
of hellish triumph throughout the
ranks of Voltaire's disciples; it
seemed as if their victory was now
secure; the old man of the Vatican,
who for generations had remained
unconquerable as fate, was in the
power of the soldier who had conquered
fate, who held Europe
in the hollow of his hand, who
raised up kings with a nod, and overthrew
dynasties with a word. He
had overcome the world, why
should he not overcome the pope?
He had demolished a score of
thrones, why should he not annihilate
this fisherman's chair that for
seventeen centuries had defied the
combined forces of the world?
Poor fools! Why not!

Jean Angelo Braschi was born
at Cesena on the 27th of December,
1717, of a noble but poor family.
His parents left him all the
patrimony they had, a faith of the
royal antique sort, and an education
worthy of the name he bore. He
was little more than a boy when
Clement XIV. saw of what stuff
the young cleric was made, and appointed
him his secretary. This
was Braschi's first step on the ladder
which was to lead him to the
perilous heights of the purple&mdash;<q>the
dye of empire and of martyrdom.</q>
</p>

<p>
When Clement XIV., pursued by
the entreaties and threats of European
potentates, yielded a weak concession
to their cabals, and spoke
of <q>reform</q> to the general of the
Jesuits (who answered, Loyola-like,
in royal scorn of the implied calumny:
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Sint ut sunt, aut non sint</foreign>),
Braschi, then cardinal, took his
stand by their side, resented every
outrage offered to the sons of Ignatius,
those courtiers of martyrdom
in all ages, and thus vindicated his
future claim to a place in the palm-bearers'
ranks. He opened his
house to the persecuted Jesuits; he
<pb n='756'/><anchor id='Pg756'/>
braved everything in his unswerving,
uncompromising fidelity to
their order. What else could befall
him but the crown of the confessor
or the martyr?
</p>

<p>
Europe hailed his accession with
delight. The pulses of the rising
monster, Revolution, were beginning
to beat, and the nations were growing
afraid, they knew not yet of
what; but all eyes were turned to
Rome, as to the rock where the
safety of the world was anchored.
The advent of a man like Pius VI.,
firm as adamant, who could brave
death, not merely for the faith, but
for every tittle of principle which
the uttermost integrity of the faith
included&mdash;a man whom his enemies
likened to Moses for his meekness,
and to Solomon for his strong wisdom;
who lived like an anchorite
and officiated with the splendor of
the prophet king, who loved the
beauty of God's house and the
place where his glory dwelt&mdash;the
advent of a priest like this to the
papal throne gave joy all over
Christendom.
</p>

<p>
Pius VI. was elected on the 15th
of February, 1775. Seldom has
the weight of that unearthly crown
fallen more heavily on its wearer's
brow than it fell on that of the new
pontiff. In the temporal order he
saw before him a mountain to be uplifted;
in the spiritual order no far-seeing
eye could fail to detect the
ominous signs of the coming storm.
Pius lost not a moment in designing
and carrying out vast schemes
of material improvement in his
dominions. In those days the Pontine
marshes were swamps of poison
that had hitherto defied all petty
attempts at reclaiming them.
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you live in this dreadful
place?</q> inquired a traveller of
one of the inhabitants of the dismal
soil.
</p>

<p>
<q>Signor, we do not live; we
die!</q> was the answer.
</p>

<p>
Pius VI. declared that henceforth
they should live. Colossal works
were set on foot, and, if the pestilential
marshes were not radically
purified, they were so much improved
as to justify the people in
proclaiming the energetic pontiff
as the worker of that miracle.
During his pontificate the draining
was so successful that Pius himself
declared this alone was ample
reward for all his sufferings. The
port of Ancona was repaired, and
its entrance adorned with a light-house;
works of art were sought for,
revealed, and cherished. Spiritual
works were founded and fostered
with royal munificence and paternal
care. The Christian Brothers
were called to Rome and a noble
school built for them, on the front
of which was inscribed the title so
glorious and so dear to the Vicar
of Christ: <q>Pius VI., the Father
of the Poor.</q>
</p>

<p>
But not even the wisdom and
prestige of this ideal pontiff could
suffice to shelter him from the
tempest that was slowly but steadily
travelling towards the Holy
City. The infidel philosophers of
France and Germany had done
their work; they had sown, and
now the time had come for reaping.
Austria first showed symptoms
of disaffection. Joseph II.,
who was too cowardly to rescue
his own sister<note place='foot'>Marie Antonette.</note> from the hands of
the torturers, had become the tool
of his minister, Kaunitz, whose
delight it was to worry the pope
with the small artillery of a cunning
and treacherous diplomacy.
These weapons, however, were not
the ones that could move Pius VI.
They glided off from the shield
<pb n='757'/><anchor id='Pg757'/>
of his unalterable patience, humility,
and truth like arrows from a
marble surface. Nor could the
weak monarch withstand the charm
of the saintly pope when he came
within its influence. He rallied to
his side when he visited Rome in
1783, and promised to be faithful
to him. But it was a broken reed,
the friendship of the vacillating
Joseph.
</p>

<p>
Spain, Tuscany, and Venice next
came to sadden the Holy Father's
heart and strengthen his growing
fears. His gentleness held them
captive for a time; but they too
were of the tribe of broken reeds.
When friends prove false, then is
the time for the treason of foes to
flourish. Catherine of Russia, the
woman with the wily head of the
snake joined to the cruel heart of
the tiger, came with honeyed words
of reverence to tender offers of service,
nay, even of allegiance, to
Pius. A far-sighted woman, this
tiger queen who was stealing into
Poland, and sucking the nation's
blood, as she crawled into its heart.
Then there was Frederick of Prussia,
more honest than many a self-styled
son of the church in those
days; he was grateful to the prince
who first assigned him his title of
king. Gustavus III. came to do
homage to the man who had
drained the Pontine marshes, and
made a noble road through that region,
so long the tomb of all who
dwelt within its poisonous area.
Pius received these marks of courtesy
with his accustomed gentle
grace; he knew what they were
worth, and was grateful without
being beguiled. They were, in
truth, the last rays of the sun that
was soon to set in darkness over
his reign, and to close it in sufferings
unparalleled for fourteen centuries
in the annals of the church.
</p>

<p>
France was to give the signal, and
she was now ready. France, that
had so often raised the standard of
the church, and defended it with
the blood of her fairest chivalry&mdash;France
was to sound the war-cry
hounding on the fanatics to the destruction
of her own purest glory.
The Reign of Terror was inaugurated.
The Constituent Assembly
had decreed the civil constitution
of the clergy. Bishops were no
longer to be what they had hitherto
been; they were henceforth to be
the nominees of an unbelieving
mob; the beautiful structure of the
spiritual hierarchy was to be destroyed.
To legalize the crime, an
oath was exacted from the priesthood;
those who refused to take
it&mdash;and their name was legion&mdash;were
deprived of the pittance allotted
them by the state, and turned
away to starve. Sixty thousand
preferred starvation to the bread
thus bought at the price of perjury.
Of one hundred and thirty-eight
bishops, four only took the oath.
Monasteries were dissolved; scandals
arose on all sides. The papal
nuncio, Cardinal de Bernis, was insulted
and compelled to fly from
Paris. The pope was burned in
effigy. Thus did France sound the
tocsin that was to herald in the
earthquake&mdash;<q>a great horror of darkness
and shakings of the world, and
a cup of trembling which all the nations
shall drink.</q> Faith is being
driven out, and <q>philosophy</q> is riding
in like a conqueror on her ruins.
Peace and the brave pageant of
virtue and all goodly things are
banished, and in their place enter
decay and chaos and unbelief;
and then the Revolution is ready.
The world is wheeling round, humanity
is going mad, nothing is
stable on the earth&mdash;nothing but
the rock of Peter, against which
<pb n='758'/><anchor id='Pg758'/>
the storm beats in foolish and impotent
rage. Pius raises his voice
above the whirlwind, and those
who hearken hear it: <q>God is unchangeable.
Truth is immutable.
The church can make no compromise.
Let us stand faithfully by
the cross. God will save his own
and redeem his word.</q> Avignon
exhibited a hecatomb of murdered
priests. On the 24th of October,
1791, over two hundred were butchered
in the <hi rend='italic'>Glacière</hi> of that city.
In September of the following year
three bishops and three hundred
priests were on one day massacred
in Paris. Numbers fled to Rome
for protection. The fragments of
the altar and the throne met in the
Eternal City&mdash;Mesdames de France
and the King and Queen of Sardinia,
proscribed prelates and priests;
and Pius opened his fatherly arms
to all. This shelter was, however,
soon to be torn from them.
</p>

<p>
On the 15th of February, 1793,
the commandant of the French
fleet at Naples walked into the
Roman consulate, and ordered the
consul to hoist the red flag and the
cap of liberty over the building.
The consul refused; a row ensued;
blood was shed. The French government
declared itself insulted,
and threatened the pope in violent
language. Meantime, the Directory
succeeded to the Convention, and
people drew a long breath, and
hoped a change had come for the
better. But, as Carnot said: <q>If
now there was less blood shed,
there were more tears.</q> The guillotine
was still erect, and its work
only slackened because the arms
of the executioners were weary.
The republican armies were progressing
in their triumphal marches.
Italy still remained to be conquered.
Bonaparte was entrusted
with the expedition. A series of
victories brought him quickly to
the gates of Rome. He proposed
the most humiliating conditions to
the Sovereign Pontiff. Pius was summoned
to cancel every bull, brief,
and pastoral that the Holy See had
issued from the beginning of the Revolution
to the present time. The
pope firmly refused to comply. Bonaparte
was at first full of insolent
fury, and threatened to annihilate
Rome and the Vatican. He relented,
however, not out of deference to Pius,
but to show his defiance of the home
government, and drew up a treaty of
his own invention, which, ruinous as
it was, the Holy Father meekly signed,
in order to save his people and
prevent bloodshed. This treaty
of Tolentino, as it was called, secured
to Bonaparte the sum of thirty-one
millions of francs, sixteen hundred
cavalry horses, and a portion
of the Romagna. The Roman
treasury was drained by this monstrous
ransom; the people were
starving, the misery was terrible.
Pius was broken-hearted, but his
courage, fed by a faith that was
anchored in God, never faltered.
His conduct all through these
dreadful days was that of a saint.
He found his only solace in prayer
and in fortifying the faith of his
suffering flock. But he had as yet
only tasted the first drops of his
chalice. The Directory had resolved
to get possession of Rome.
A pretext must be created, since
Pius would not furnish even the
semblance of one, for breaking the
iniquitous treaty, which had thus
far secured to him the integrity of
the Holy City. General Duphot
was fired on by the Roman troops
acting in discharge of their duty.
Berthier was at once ordered to
leave Ancona, where he was stationed
with the French army, and to
march on Rome and encamp under
<pb n='759'/><anchor id='Pg759'/>
its walls. His first step was to
issue a proclamation exciting the
citizens to revolt, insulting and
calumniating the pope and his
government, and announcing himself
as the liberator of an oppressed
people. He entered the city next
day, and took possession by placing
seals on the museums and galleries,
which were <q>henceforth the property
of the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>grande nation</foreign> that had
come to set free the Roman people.</q>
A tree of liberty was planted
on the capitol; tricolor flags floated
on the public monuments, and
tricolor ribbons decked the ears
of Marcus Aurelius' horse. The
Holy Father was outraged in his
own house; his furniture was taken
from him, and his jewels; he was
despoiled even of his pontifical
robes; his private library, a valuable
collection of 40,000 volumes,
was seized and sold to a dealer for
12,000 crowns. The deliverers of
Rome crowned these proceedings
by inviting their victim to wear the
tricolor cockade by way of a badge
of authority from France. Pius VI.
replied with majestic meekness:
<q>I can wear no livery but that with
which the church has clothed me.</q>
This answer was distorted into an
insulting challenge to the French
government, and Haller immediately
received orders to convey the
pope by force out of Rome. Pius
gently pleaded his age and many
infirmities, and entreated the poor
grace of being allowed to die in the
midst of his people. <q>Oh! for
that matter, you can die wherever
you are,</q> was the brutal retort, and
measures were commenced for carrying
him away by force, in case he
made any resistance. This was not
likely; but the old pontiff's heart
was breaking. <q>God's will be done!</q>
he murmured. <q>Let us bow to
whatever he sees good to ordain!</q>
</p>

<p>
Forty-eight hours were all that
was allowed him to prepare for this
sudden departure. He devoted the
short time entirely to the affairs of
the church and to the performance
of his religious duties. The night
of the 20th of February was fixed
for the departure. It was late
when Haller brusquely entered the
Holy Father's room, and found him
prostrate before the crucifix, bathed
in tears. <q>It is time to go,</q> he said,
and the French escort entered and
rudely hurried the old man down
the Vatican stairs and into the carriage
that was waiting for him. In
it were seated his physician and
his groom of the chambers, and two
other officers of his household.
The people followed the carriage,
loudly lamenting, and invoking all
blessings on their beloved pastor.
At Viterbo many French priests
flocked round him with the Italian
crowds, and fell on their knees for
a last benediction. The first halt
of the travellers was in Tuscany.
The Directory would fain have sent
their august prisoner to Sardinia,
but they were deterred in this by
fear of the English government, and
so proceeded to Sienna, where for
three months the Augustinian convent
had the privilege of harboring
the persecuted Vicar of Christ.
Whilst here the finger of Providence
showed visibly its protecting care of
him. The Holy Father had just left
his room one morning when the ceiling
fell in, and crushed everything
beneath it; the house was violently
shaken by an earthquake, and suffered
much damage. This event
forced Pius to seek hospitality at
the Monastery of Chartreuse, in
Florence, where he arrived on the
2d of June. Here some tender consolations
awaited him. The Grand
Duke of Tuscany came frequently
to the feet of his venerated pastor,
<pb n='760'/><anchor id='Pg760'/>
to assure him of his loyal attachment.
The King and Queen
of Sardinia also gathered round him,
driven from Rome, where they had
been so lovingly welcomed on being
robbed of the throne which the
saintly sister of Louis XVI. had
adorned so nobly. Her husband
had ever been a devoted son of the
Holy Father, and now declared that
the sight of his serenity in the
midst of trials so overwhelming was
enough to make him forget his own
sorrows.
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot regret my throne, for
I find more than it gave me at the
feet of your Holiness!</q> he once exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alas! beloved prince,</q> replied
Pius, <q>all is vanity here below.
What examples of this are we
both! Let us look up to heaven;
there await us those thrones that can
never perish.</q> They entreated him to
go with them to Sardinia the moment
it was possible for themselves to return
there; but Pius refused. He
alleged his age and suffering health
as a reason for remaining where he
was; but the true motive was the
fear that his presence in the generous
king's dominions might prove
fatal to him and his people. They
parted with many tears, never to
meet again on earth.
</p>

<p>
All this time the captive pope
devoted his whole mind to the government
of the church and the
strengthening of his afflicted children.
He lost no opportunity of
sending messages of encouragement
to those who were at a distance,
exhorting them to suffer cheerfully,
pointing to the day of joy and
of triumph that would soon dawn
after the short night of darkness.
His own serenity was a fountain of
hope and sweetness to all who beheld
it. Like the great apostle, he
seemed in deed and in truth to
glory in his infirmities and in Christ
crucified.
</p>

<p>
A multitude of proscribed priests
and prelates had fled to England,
whence they wrote eloquent letters
of condolence to their captive chief,
protesting their allegiance to him
and to the faith, and their readiness
to die for both, if needful. These
proofs of devout affection deeply
moved the Holy Father, and consoled
him for much. The Directory
began at last to feel alarmed at the
attitude of foreign cabinets towards
the Holy See. England spoke in
fearless condemnation of the cruelty
of the French government towards
Pius, and made no disguise of her
sympathy with the exiled priests
and royalists. France commanded
the Grand Duke of Tuscany to
drive the pontiff out of his states;
but that prince replied with royal
dignity: <q>I did not bring the pope
here, and I certainly will not drive
him away.</q> The grand duke paid
for his boldness; his dominions were
forthwith invaded, and Etruria added
to the French territory. Austria
was next appealed to, and requested
to receive the pope into
custody, a convent on the Danube
being named as a suitable abode;
but Austria haughtily declined.
Spain lastly refused to become his
jailer.
</p>

<p>
Nothing, therefore, remained but
to secure his person by bringing
him to France. Humanity cried
out against the barbarity of subjecting
the venerable old man to so
long and painful a journey in his
present state; but France had no
ears for the voice of humanity.
Pius VI. was now partially paralyzed;
he was covered with blisters, and
unable to move without labor and
acute pain. But what of that?
He was dragged to Parma, where a
few days' rest was granted. The
<pb n='761'/><anchor id='Pg761'/>
medical men even then declared
they would not take the responsibility
of proceeding with their prisoner,
lest he should die on the road.
The French commissioner, impatient
of so paltry an obstacle in the
way of his orders, burst into the
pope's room, flung down the bed-clothes,
and, seeing with his own
eyes the truth of the report, turned
on his heel with the remark, <q>Alive
or dead, he must go on!</q>
</p>

<p>
The cortège started accordingly.
All along the road the gentle martyr
was cheered by the love and
pity of the people. Multitudes ran
for miles by the side of his carriage,
bareheaded, weeping, and invoking
the blessing of the Most High upon
him. Pius was moved to tears at
the sight of their courage in thus
openly compassionating him, and
with his suffering hand, almost disabled
as it was, he made an effort
to bless them again and again from
the window.
</p>

<p>
On the 24th they reached Milan.
The escort, in order to hide his
presence from the people, and prevent
similar scenes of enthusiasm
and indignation, conveyed their
prisoner into the citadel at three
o'clock in the morning. On the
26th they hurried him out of his
sleep in the dead of the night, and
conveyed him secretly to Oulx, and
the next morning they started to
cross the Alps. Who shall describe
the sufferings of Pius VI. during
that transit? His body was now
one wound; his feeble strength was
almost spent; he seemed scarcely
more than a breathing corpse. They
placed him roughly in a sort of sedan-chair,
while the rest of the escort
followed on mules. The road over
the mountains was precipitous and
stony; every step was agony to
the suffering pontiff. The cold was
intense. Some Piedmontese officers,
touched with compassion, took off
their warm pelisses, and begged him
to use them; the Holy Father thanked
them with emotion, but refused.
<q>I do not suffer,</q> said he gently,
<q>and I have nothing to fear; the
hand of God is upholding me.
Courage, my friends! Let us put
our confidence in God, and all will
be well with us.</q>
</p>

<p>
On the 30th the wayfarers reached
Briançon. Pius was visibly
moved on beholding the soil of
France, that unhappy land where
such fearful crimes were being perpetrated,
but where God was already
preparing miracles of repentance.
He was taken to the hospital
for a lodging. The people, horrified
at the wretched, attenuated aspect
of the Vicar of Christ, a prisoner
in the hands of the men who had
deluged their country in blood, were
loud in expressing their pity and respect;
they flocked in crowds round
the hospital, calling out for the Holy
Father to appear at the window and
bless them. But the jailers forbade
him to show himself, and forced the
people to disperse. The few companions
of his exile who had accompanied
him so far were now taken
from him, his confessor and
valet being alone permitted to remain.
This cruel isolation lasted for
nearly a month, and would no doubt
have been continued still longer if
the progress of Soovorof's army in
Italy had not frightened the Directory,
and decided them to send their
prisoner further on to Grenoble,
where he was rejoined by his faithful
attendants. Watched and humiliated
as he was, his journey hither was one
long ovation in every village and
town through which he passed.
The people would not be beaten
off, but flocked in thousands to
greet him, falling on their knees
round the carriage, rending the air
<pb n='762'/><anchor id='Pg762'/>
with their cries, and calling down
vengeance on those who persecuted
Jesus Christ in the person of his
vicar. The women everywhere
were foremost in testifying their devotion
to the Holy Father. They
disguised themselves as peasants,
as servants, or venders, and bribed
the guards to admit them to his
presence, where ladies of the highest
rank were proud to perform any
menial service for him.
</p>

<p>
At Grenoble a hundred young
girls dressed in white came forth
to meet him, singing canticles and
strewing flowers in his path. Pius
VI. smiled lovingly on them, and
blessed them with tears in his
eyes. Precautions were useless; no
threats could restrain the hearts
of the pastor's children, and this
sorrowful journey, in spite of its
cruelties, resembled the triumphal
march of a king amidst his people.
They reached Valence on the 14th
of July. The pope was lodged in
the citadel. Close by, imprisoned
in a Benedictine convent, were
thirty-two priests who had shared
his hospitality in Rome, and been
compelled to leave it when he had
been taken away. They entreated
on their knees to be allowed to go
and ask his blessing; but the prayer
was denied, and the Holy Father
was strictly forbidden to go beyond
the garden-gate, which was guarded
day and night, lest by showing himself
he should excite disturbance
amongst the people. All prohibitions
were alike to Pius now, for he
felt that the goal was at hand, and
the journey would soon be ended.
He was suffering terribly, and knew
that the hand of death was upon
him. Sweet came the summons to
the pilgrim pontiff. <q>All journeys
end in welcomes to the weary.</q>
Pius had trod the stony path, cross-laden
like his Master, crowned, like
him, with the thorny diadem of sacrifice
and love, and now the promised
land was in sight, and angel songs
were breaking on the pilgrim's ear:
<q>Come, thou who hast suffered persecution
for my sake; come and
reign with me in my kingdom.</q>
</p>

<p>
For some days the Holy Father
remained altogether absorbed in
prayer, as if unconscious of everything
around him. Often in the
midst of his prayer he would break
out into expressions of pardon towards
his enemies, or pity for the
sufferings of his children. <q>What
are the sufferings of my body compared
to what my heart endures for
them?</q> he once exclaimed. <q>My
cardinals, my bishops, scattered and
persecuted, ... Rome, ... my people,
... the church, ... O my
Saviour! in what a state am I forced
to leave them all.</q>
</p>

<p>
The symptoms of final dissolution
now rapidly increased, and the
pains he endured were so terrible
as to bring on long fainting fits.
</p>

<p>
On the 28th of August Pius asked
for the last rites of the church.
He insisted, in spite of the agonies
he was suffering, on being dressed
in full pontificals, and placed in a
chair, so as to receive the Holy
Viaticum with the greatest possible
reverence. His supreme devotion
all through life had been to the Blessed
Sacrament. His desire was complied
with, and then, placing one
hand upon his breast, and the other
on the Holy Gospels, he made with
great solemnity his dying confession
of faith according to the pontifical
formula. He then repeated
several times, in the most impressive
tones, his free forgiveness of
his enemies, invoking the mercy
and pardon of God upon them; he
prayed earnestly also for the conversion
of France; this done, he received
the Bread of Angels.
</p>

<pb n='763'/><anchor id='Pg763'/>

<p>
On the 29th, the following day,
Extreme Unction was administered
by the Archbishop of Corinth. The
Holy Father seemed to rally slightly
after this, and was able to turn his
attention a little to temporal affairs.
At midnight the palpitations of his
heart and other symptoms gave
warning that the end had come.
The faithful little band of friends
and fellow-captives gathered round
their dying pastor, and kissed the
hand that could no longer lift itself
to bless them. The Archbishop of
Corinth gave the papal absolution,
which the Holy Father received with
deep humility and fervor, and, after
a faint effort to give a last blessing
to those who were kneeling in tears
at his feet, he breathed his last
with the words of the benediction
half finished on his lips. It was an
hour after midnight on the 29th of
August, 1799. Pius VI. was in his
eighty-second year, and had governed
the church for twenty-four
years, six months, and fourteen
days.
</p>

<p>
A cry of anguish and of exultation
rang through Christendom
when the news of his death went
forth. The faithful mourned their
shepherd, the brave pastor who
had loved them and defended them
even to death; the wicked rejoiced
and clapped hands, exclaiming,
<q>Now we have done with him!
This old man is the last of the
popes! He has died in a foreign
land, hunted like a dog, without
honors or followers. His court
and his hierarchy are dispersed;
we have done with Rome and Roman
popes!</q> Short-sighted fools,
that knew not how to distinguish
between defeat and victory, because
they could not read the mystic
scroll which the hand of God has
traced above the cross: <q>In this
sign thou shalt conquer!</q>
</p>

<p>
The remains of the venerable old
man were exposed for several days;
the crowds were so great, both day
and night, that it was found impossible
to remove them at once, as had
been intended. The people proclaimed
the martyr-pope a saint,
and flocked round the bier to gaze
upon those worn and emaciated
features where the majestic peace
of death now sat like a golden
shadow. For miles around Valence
multitudes flowed in to see him, to
touch the bier, to throw flowers
upon it, and bear them away again
as sacred relics. The authorities
of the place did not even try to
prevent these public demonstrations
of respect and enthusiasm.
The Directory thought fit to be silent
regarding them, and even issued
orders that the pope should
be laid out with the state becoming
a sovereign. Thus the victim who
had been denied the commonest
mercies of humanity when he was
on his death-bed was surrounded
in his coffin with the pomp and
paraphernalia of royalty.
</p>

<p>
The body was finally placed in
the citadel of Valence, where it remained
until Bonaparte, on being
raised to the consulate, had it removed
under a bombastic decree
setting forth <q>the magnanimity of
the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>grande nation</foreign> to a good but
weak old man who had for a while
been the enemy of France, owing
to perfidious advisers, etc.</q> This
grandiloquent proclamation ended
in the remains of the first sovereign
in Christendom being transported
to the common burial-ground,
where the charity of a Protestant
courageously raised a small stone
chapel over his grave. A few years
later (1801) the body was brought
back to Rome, and placed in the
fitting shrine of a martyred pope&mdash;the
Basilica of S. Peter. So does
<pb n='764'/><anchor id='Pg764'/>
the King of Heaven overturn the
designs of earthly kings, making
sport of their power, and confounding
their vain rebellion.

<q>Elias smote the waters of Jordan
with his mantle, and with Eliseus
passed over on dry ground....
And Eliseus said unto him: I pray
thee let a double portion of thy

</p>

<p>
And as the friends went on, behold
a chariot of fire and horses of
fire came and parted them both
asunder, and Elias went up to heaven,
and Eliseus saw him no more;
but he took up the mantle of the
prophet that had fallen from him,
and went back and stood by the

waters with the mantle, and they
parted, and he went over as before.

And who are these that we behold
like a cloud travelling towards
us from the West? Lo! they come,

company of pilgrims, who <q>have
feared neither distance nor danger</q>
to come from the furthest ends of
the earth to lay the tribute of your
love at the feet of Peter. Thrice
welcome! ye sons and daughters of
America, who have come to clasp

of our common father. May
ye be blessed ten thousand-fold for

One venerable figure shines forth
amidst the band; the wisdom of
nigh fourscore years is on her brow,
the peace of a long life spent in the
service of her Lord. She gazes on
the wonders of the Holy City, on its
glorious shrines, its stately temples,
its monasteries and convents, its
brave army of priests and monks
and nuns, and, filled with holy envy
at the sight, her fervent spirit exclaims:
<q>Oh! if we could but carry
this away with us. If we had these
riches in America!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay, lady, grudge us not our

likewise may not be taken from us,
and give thanks to God for the
great things that are being accomplished
in your own wonderful land.
There the faith is like the sun at
daybreak, scarcely yet above the
horizon, but already powerful and
splendid. What has become of
that sun amongst us? Oh! I will
not utter it.... Verily, there is

and the cloud shall be scattered.

hastened.</q><note place='foot'>Words of Monsignor Nardi to Mrs. Peter.</note>

The mystic mantle which Christ
first laid upon his apostle has descended
through the ages, through
evil times and persecutions, to the
prophet of our own days, untorn,
unstained, a garment of immortality
and strength. Now, as then, it
bears him in safety through the
flood; now, as then, does he <q>throw
salt upon the waters,</q> and cure
them, so that all those who come
and drink thereof have life and
salvation. For God changes not,
nor can those who love him and
love one another in his love perish,
nor their hope be confounded.

<head>I. Juxta Crucem.</head>

<p>
The full moon was pouring a
flood of light upon the marble pavement
of S. Peter's, and, by its weird
influence, increased to an almost
startling immensity the vastness of
that mighty work of art, worthy offspring
and expression of the faith
which has subdued the world. The
soft radiance in the nave seemed
to throw into deeper gloom and
an almost immeasurable space the
ever-burning lamps which, like fixed
stars, surround the central point
of Christendom&mdash;the tomb of the
great apostle, to whom was first
given the power of the keys. No
one could remain unmoved in such
an awe-inspiring scene; certainly
not two, at least, of the three persons
who alone stood within the
church, silently receiving impressions
which come but seldom in a
life-time. And yet, as the same
sunbeam, falling upon different
objects, will produce different colors,
so on these three minds the impressions
were stamped according
to their preparation to receive
them. To the man, in whom the
moonlight, bathing him in brightness,
revealed the appearance of
gentle birth and refined culture, it
was merely the human, the miracle
of art, the power of man to design
and execute; while the pure soul
of the fair young girl at his side
was struggling through the human
up to the divine. The patient old
sacristan standing apart, keys in
hand, had dwelt for years in the
midst of material and spiritual
greatness with a faith so simple
that he never dreamed it was sublime.
</p>

<p>
<q>How grand!</q> at length exclaimed
Mr. Carlisle. <q>What a power there
is in architecture; and how well those
master-minds understood and used
this power for the elevation of
man!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> replied his young companion;
<q>and it seems to me that
in church architecture every detail
should be symbolic, and the whole
should convey to the soul the impression
of some one of God's attributes.
S. Peter's is so truly the
home of the Christian world, and
draws the heart so lovingly to itself,
that it always seems to express
the paternity of God. But to-night
there is more than this. It speaks
to my very soul of the Father, but
<q>the Father of an Infinite Majesty.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carlisle smiled. <q>Another
of your pretty fancies, Assunta.
One would hardly expect to find
such grave thoughts beneath this
shining hair, which the alchemy of
the moonlight is fast turning into
gold.</q>
</p>

<p>
The usual ready answer did not
come; for any light conversation
was out of harmony with the emotion
inspired by such surroundings. Besides,
the young girl was struggling
with herself and against herself
in a contest little suspected by her
companion. The wonderful influence
<pb n='766'/><anchor id='Pg766'/>
of the time and place had
brought near the moment of defeat
or victory. It is sometimes the
way of God with the soul to prepare
it gradually for some struggle,
and then suddenly and unexpectedly
to bring it face to face with
the trial, and to permit its whole
future to hang upon the decision
of a moment. Thank God! to
the faithful soul the strength is
never wanting. It was such a
crisis as this which clouded the
bright face and darkened with
doubt the mind of one in whom
youth and innocence would seem
to preclude the possibility of mental
conflict.
</p>

<p>
It was but a few days since she
had become convinced that the
guardian who had been to her
both friend and father had come to
feel for her a love which indeed
might include that of father and
friend, as the greater includes the
less, but which was something
more than either. And with the
consciousness there came a strange
yearning of her heart to go forth
and meet his heart with an equal
love, to trust herself to the protecting
care she knew so well, to yield
to the happiness which promised to
gild her life with a radiance too
dazzling to be all of earth. But
there arose a barrier between them,
and hence the struggle.
</p>

<p>
Strange how we play the devil's
advocate against our conscience!
Must she respect that barrier?
What if he were almost an infidel;
would it not be her sweet mission
to take heaven by violence, if need
be, and by her importunate prayers
obtain for him the light of faith?
Dangerous sophistry! And yet on
this quicksand how many women
wreck themselves, instead of steering
the bark freighted with the loved
soul into the calm waters of truth!
</p>

<p>
They two, the guardian and his
ward, had entered the church while
yet the setting sun was irradiating
column and statue with a glowing
splendor; and they had continued
to walk slowly and almost in silence
up and down the long nave until
the light had faded and darkness
had succeeded the short twilight.
</p>

<p>
They were about to leave the
calm influence and the majesty of
repose which this vast temple of
God ever inspires, when suddenly
the moon, rising to a level with
the window above the porch, poured
its magic-working beams upon
the pavement. They paused, and,
turning to the sacristan, who was
about to close the doors for the
night, begged a few moments' delay,
which he, with unusual cordiality,
granted.
</p>

<p>
And what were the busy thoughts
which induced so prolonged a
silence during that hour's walk,
until the gathering darkness and
then the rising moon warned them
how the time was passing, of which
they had taken so little note?
Suffice it to say that the mind of
each was filled with the other.
With Assunta Howard, the new
sentiments kindled in her heart had
conjured up the memory of a scene
which, associated with her first sorrow,
was a living picture to her
imagination. Again, as if it were
but yesterday, she, a little child, entered
the room of her dying mother,
and saw her lying pale and beautiful
upon her bed, her crucifix in
her hand, and beside her the little
table covered with white linen, upon
which were the exquisite flowers
and the still burning candles placed
there in honor of her divine Lord,
whom she had just received as the
Viaticum of her journey home.
The little Assunta thought how
much her mamma looked like the
<pb n='767'/><anchor id='Pg767'/>
beautiful S. Catherine, borne in the
arms of the lovely angels, which
hung above her own bed; and she
wondered if the angels would come
before she had time to kiss her mother
once again. It was almost
with a feeling of awe that she whispered
in the ear of the good priest
who raised her in his arms, <q>Is
mamma a saint now?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My precious child,</q> said the
mother, strengthened for this bitter
parting by the divine Guest who
was reposing in her heart, <q>mamma
must leave her little Assunta,
her good little girl. But before
long I hope that I shall be with the
dear Jesus and his sweet Mother,
whom you love so much. So you
will be glad for mamma, and always
remember how much she loves you.
I am not very strong, my darling,
but put your arms around my neck,
and your curly head close to mine,
while I say something to you. You
will not understand me now, my
poor child, but I know that you
will try and remember all, and one
of these days you will know what I
mean. My darling, when you are
grown up to be as tall as mamma,
some one will perhaps find a way
into that loving little heart. My
little daughter, if divine love claims
it, and our dear Lord wishes you
to be all his own, do not hesitate,
but gladly give your life as a sweet
offering to him who has chosen
you. Give him your whole heart
without a fear. But if it is a human
love which seeks to make my
treasure all its own, think long and
well and prayerfully, my child, before
you give your heart into its
keeping. And, O Assunta! remember,
never marry one who does not
cherish your faith as you do; who
cannot kneel with you before the
altar, and love you <emph>in God</emph>, even as
you do him. I do not ask you to
promise me this, for I feel that it
would not be right to bind you by
a promise which you cannot understand.
Yet it is your dying mother's
wish. But I must kiss the
wondering expression away from
those dear eyes. One of these days
dear F. Joseph will remind you of
my request when you are old
enough to understand&mdash;will you
not, father? But my little girl can
remember that she is to be poor
papa's dear comfort, and never forget
the little prayer for him every
day, that God will give to him&mdash;tell
me what you ask for papa, my
darling?</q>
</p>

<p>
The little Assunta answered
through her sobs: <q>I want papa to
love my blessed Mother Mary, and
I ask God to make him. And,
mamma, you said I must say faith;
but I don't know what that means,
except when I say it in the catechism,
and so I ask God to make
him as good as mamma is, and a
saint just like S. Joseph in my picture;
and I think he will, mamma,
because you know he heard me
once when I asked him to let me
go to school to Sister Rose.</q>
</p>

<p>
The mother smiled, as she replied:
</p>

<p>
<q>How earnestly I hope so, my
daughter! And papa has promised
me to leave you with the good Sisters
for a long time; so you must please
him by being his good, obedient
child. And now, my dear, precious
little girl, kiss me&mdash;once again, my
darling. I am very tired, and must
rest. Perhaps, when I wake up, I
shall see, instead of my darling's
golden curls, the golden gates of the
celestial city. When I am gone,
Assunta, child of Mary, say every
day: <q>Dear Jesus, take mamma
home soon.</q> Now call papa.</q>
</p>

<p>
The priest, who had stood by in
silence, came forward and lifted the
<pb n='768'/><anchor id='Pg768'/>
poor bewildered child down from
the bed. He saw that the strength
which had until now supported the
mother in this time of trial was
quite exhausted. She uttered aloud
the words, <q>Thy will, not mine</q>&mdash;words
which, since that night beneath
the olives in Gethsemane,
express both the bitterness of the
chalice and the ministry of the angel&mdash;then
her eyes closed; and though
for a short time consciousness remained,
they never opened until
the resplendent majesty of the glorious
humanity of her divine Lord
burst upon her soul's vision.
</p>

<p>
As the child turned away to obey
her mother's request, the priest began
to repeat the <hi rend='italic'>Proficiscere, anima
Christiana</hi>, with which the church
so lovingly speeds her children on
their last journey; and for the first
time she realized that her mother
was indeed going from her. She
crept softly from the room, only to
rush away to her own little chamber,
where, kneeling before the picture
of S. Catherine, evermore associated
with that great, first sorrow,
she poured out the grief of her loving,
childish heart in sobs and
tears.
</p>

<p>
And it was this scene which was
again before the mental eye of the
young girl as she stood there in
the moonlight, herself so fair a
picture. Her sainted mother, with
her look of heavenly repose, and
the angel-borne S. Catherine, blended
themselves into one image in her
mind, while the Holy Spirit was
guiding her innocent soul. Suddenly
an impulse seized her; perhaps
it was what mystic writers
call an inspiration. Turning to her
guardian, whose eyes had for some
time been wonderingly fixed upon
her, she hastily exclaimed: <q>One
moment, my friend,</q> and then walked
quickly towards the chapel,
where hung the lamp which told
of the divine Presence upon the
altar.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carlisle was quite accustomed
to what he was pleased to call
her <q>pretty, graceful piety,</q> and
so, without surprise, he turned to
exchange a few words with the
patient sacristan, while, on her
knees before her Lord, Assunta
fought and conquered in the first
real battle of her life. She realized
fully now the love which seemed to
offer her such human happiness,
and she knew what it would cost
her to refuse it. But then came
the remembrance of her mother's
dying words&mdash;<q>Unless he can love
you <emph>in God</emph></q>&mdash;and her heroic soul
gathered up its strength for the
consummation of the act of sacrifice.
With one appealing, heart-breaking
prayer for help, she bowed her
head, and made to God the promise
which her mother had not required
from the child. And those alone
who know what it is to offer up the
crown and joy of life in sacrifice
can understand the peace and rest
which came to her troubled heart,
even through the vision of a life
robbed of its brightness.
</p>

<p>
Absorbed as she was, she had
forgotten the world outside and its
distracting claims until her guardian
stood beside her.
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Petite</foreign>,</q> he whispered, <q>in thy
orisons be all my sins remembered.
But since the list is somewhat long,
I think you must not wait to recall
them now. Your one moment has
lengthened into fifteen by my watch,
and I have exhausted my powers
of eloquence in my endeavors to
charm that good old man into forgetfulness
of the flight of time.
Can you not leave heaven for earth
and us poor mortals? There are so
many angels up in heaven, they can
afford to spare us our only one.</q>
</p>

<pb n='769'/><anchor id='Pg769'/>

<p>
Rising hastily, Assunta exclaimed:
<q>I have been very thoughtless,
and you, as always, kind and patient.
We will go at once.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her gentle apologies to the old
sacristan added value to the gift she
slipped into his hand; and as he
closed and locked the door behind
them, he muttered to himself:
</p>

<p>
<q>She is a saint anyhow, if she is
an American.</q>
</p>

<p>
As they passed down the steps towards
the carriage, Mr. Carlisle suddenly
stopped, exclaiming: <q>Why,
child, what is the matter? You
have the real martyr-look on your
face. I read there, as in a book,
that combination of suffering and
triumph which we see in pictures,
representing those times when men
were not so chivalrous as now, and
inflicted persecutions on account
of a devotion which is so natural
to your sex, and which,</q> he added,
laughing, <q>is so particularly becoming
where the woman is young
and pretty. But,</q> he said uneasily,
<q>I cannot see that expression in
the face of my <foreign rend='italic'>petite</foreign>. Sunshine is
her element; and the cloud which
should cast a shadow upon her life
would burst forth in thunder over
mine. But what is it? Has the
moonlight enchanted you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, dear friend,</q> replied Assunta,
endeavoring to speak gayly.
<q>Enough that you grant me the
triumph. The laurel wreath is a
woman's ambition. You need not
bestow the martyr's palm until it
is deserved. And now let us go
home.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Indeed, that is the one thing in
this world which I do not intend to
do, at least at present. Thanks
to my good sister's well-timed headache,
we have a rare opportunity to
follow out our own sweet will in
the most unconventional manner.
There is no respect for the world
and the propriety Clara preaches
left in me to-night. I, for one, shall
take advantage of the absence of
that inconvenient third party and
her friend Mrs. Grundy to drive to
the Colosseum. If you decline to
accompany me, I will just remind
you that the walk home is somewhat
long and the hour somewhat
late.</q> Saying which, he gave his
order to the coachman, and took
his seat beside Assunta in the
barouche. After a short silence, he
continued:
</p>

<p>
<q>The cat-is-away sensation takes
me back to my school-boy days.
Though I confess dear Clara to be
the very best of the tabby race, still
she does show her claws sometimes
when I propose an escapade that
shocks her sense of what is becoming
at the advanced age of thirty-five.
To see the Colosseum to-night
is not to be resisted. There is no
dampness whatever in the air, and
the moon has risen just high enough
to make the shadows perfect.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I think,</q> said Assunta, <q>that it
must be a very guilty conscience
that needs so many words in its
justification. I, for my part, am
so strong in innocence that I will
meet Clara on my return with an
unblushing brow&mdash;to speak poetically&mdash;as
far as the Colosseum is
concerned. The evening is certainly
lovely enough to reduce even
your friend Mrs. Grundy to a spirit
of meek acquiescence. <q>How beautiful
is night!</q> Do you remember
the first lines of <hi rend='italic'>Thalaba</hi>? It must
have been just such a moon as this
that suggested the opening of that
remarkable poem.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did you not read it to me?
How can you ask, then, if I remember?
However, I did not hear it
then for the first time. The dogs,
with their human eyes, made a great
impression even upon my boyish
<pb n='770'/><anchor id='Pg770'/>
mind. But here we are.</q> And
jumping down from the carriage,
he held out his hand to her.
</p>

<p>
One moment she hesitated; for,
by that instinct which is the shadow
of a coming event, she felt that her
trial was not yet at an end. But
if it must come, why not then?
She might never again be so prepared
to meet it. There is a fervor
of heroism which immediately
succeeds a sacrifice that makes us
strong to endure. If there is a step
to be taken, it is better not to wait
until the inevitable reaction is upon
us with its enervating influence.
</p>

<p>
The hesitation was too instantaneous
to be remarked, and Assunta
allowed her guardian to assist
her to alight; and placing her arm
within his, they passed the sentinel,
and entered the vast amphitheatre.
It was indeed a perfect Roman
night; and, to an artistic eye, nothing
could be more imposing than
the strong contrast between the
deep gloom beneath those bewildering
arches, which threw their dark
shadows across the open arena,
and the brightness of a winter's
moon. The two walked towards
the centre, and seated themselves
upon the steps of the large cross
which rises in the midst of this
mighty relic of heathen Rome.
Assunta almost shuddered, as if at
an evil omen, when she observed
that she had unconsciously placed
herself so that the shadow of the
cross fell directly upon her, and
stretched out its unnatural length
at her feet. But even had she been
superstitiously inclined, she might
well have felt that no place could
be so safe and sure as beneath the
shadow of the cross; it rested so
protectingly on her young head,
seeming to stand between her and
evil. Soon she realized this, and
checked the impulse which, alas!
too many of us follow when suddenly
we find ourselves close under
Calvary&mdash;the mount whose crown
is a cross, and whose cross is salvation&mdash;the
impulse to move <q>out
of the shadow into the sun,</q> out of
the cloud which wraps us about in
love into the sunlight with which
the world seeks to dazzle us into
forgetfulness.
</p>

<p>
Gradually they fell into a quiet
conversation, the beauty of the
scene, the many associations of the
past which cling to these ancient
walls, furnishing ample topics. At
last Mr. Carlisle, turning suddenly
to Assunta, said:
</p>

<p>
<q>And how many years is it since
your poor father summoned me to
his bedside, and told me of the
troublesome charge I should find
in the convent, to be transferred
into my hands when the patience
of the nuns had reached the limit
of endurance, and my young lady
the age of eighteen?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is five years since, my most
ungracious and ungrateful guardian.
But you will soon be released
from duty. The fifteenth of
next August will be my twenty-first
birthday. It was because I came
into the world on the Feast of the
Assumption that my dear mother
gave me the name, at which all her
good, practical American friends
wondered and held up their hands.
Well, on that morning I shall offer
you freedom, and I shall expect to
hear you exclaim, quoting your
favorite Shakespeare, <q>For this relief
much thanks!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And I suppose you will think,</q>
said Mr. Carlisle, somewhat bitterly,
<q>that it will be enough, after all
these years, to say, <q>You have been
kind to me, my guardian, quite
like a father; I am very grateful,
and hope that we may meet again</q>;
and with a good-by and a pretty
<pb n='771'/><anchor id='Pg771'/>
courtesy shake off the shackles,
and take yourself, with all your
sunshine, out into the world to
make bright the life of others,
forgetting him whose life you alone
have the power to darken by absence.
Ah! child,</q> he said, his
tone changing to tender earnestness,
<q>do you not know with what
tie I would bind you to me so
that no age could have the right to
separate us? Do you think that it
is as a father that I love you?
That might have been once; but
now it is the love of a man of
thirty-five, who for the first time
has found his ideal of woman realized.
Assunta, do I ask too much?
When that day comes of which you
speak, will you not give me the
right to devote my life to you?
You were looking forward to the
day which was to give you freedom;
and you hesitate to put
yourself under bondage? If you
knew my love for you, you would
believe that I ask but the right
to love and protect you always.
Have I been so severe a guardian
that you dare not trust me as a
husband? Assunta, you do not
speak. If you cannot love me now,
will you not at least let me try to
win your love?</q> And as he looked
into the face which she now turned
towards him, he exclaimed with a
mingling of doubt and triumph,
<q>Child, you do love me!</q>
</p>

<p>
It was well for Assunta that she
had fought her battle beforehand,
else she could hardly have hoped
to conquer now. <q>My dear, kind
friend,</q> she said sadly, <q>I would
have given much to spare you this.
It seems indeed a poor return for
all you have been to me to reject
the love for which I am very grateful.
But it must be so. I cannot
marry you, Mr. Carlisle.</q>
</p>

<p>
The triumph in his face faded;
but, fortunately for his diminishing
hope, doubt remained.
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Petite</foreign>,</q> he said, <q>I have taken
you by surprise. Do not give me
your answer now. Let me take
home to-night but a hope and
your promise to reconsider your
hasty decision, and I will try to be
content. But you are so cold, so
calm, Assunta. Can it be that
I have entirely deceived myself,
that perhaps some other</q>&mdash;He
paused.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am calm, my friend,</q> she answered,
<q>because there is no
struggle of indecision in my mind.
There is very great regret that I
must give you pain, and it costs
me more than you know to do so.
I entreat you to be generous&mdash;more
generous than I have been
to you&mdash;and end this trying conversation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot end it without one
question more; pardon me if I am
wrong in asking it. Assunta, there
is something that I do not understand.
You do not say that you
could not love me, but that you
cannot marry me. Who or what
is it, then, that comes between us?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>God!</q> And she spoke the
word so reverently that for one
moment Mr. Carlisle was subdued
and silent. Then the bitterness
which was always latent in his nature
gained the ascendency, as he
replied:
</p>

<p>
<q>Some interference of your
church, I suppose.</q>
</p>

<p>
Assunta was not a saint, and her
previous emotion had weakened
her powers of self-control, for she
spoke with unusual spirit.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, the church does interfere,
thank God, to save her children,
else were she no true mother.</q>
Then, a little ashamed of her warmth
of defence, she continued, without
seeming to notice Mr. Carlisle's
<pb n='772'/><anchor id='Pg772'/>
ironical repetition of her words
<q><emph>save</emph> her children</q>:
</p>

<p>
<q>You will no doubt consider me
fanatical, but you have a right to
know why I refuse the love which
I value so much, and which, at the
same time, I must beg you to forget.
I can never marry one who
is not of my faith. I believe that,
in a true marriage, there must be
more than the tie of human love&mdash;there
must be the union of soul
and the blessing of the church.
And more than this, there is the
insuperable barrier of a solemn
promise made to God in consequence
of my dying mother's last
request. Need I say more? And
must I lose my best friend because
I can only respect and love him
<q>as friends love</q>? I had not looked
for so great a sacrifice.</q> And
for the first time the tears stood
in her eyes and her voice trembled.
</p>

<p>
She waited for a few minutes, but
no reply came. Then, noticing
that the moon had risen above
arch and wall, and, pouring its
light full upon the open arena, had
sent the shadows back to their hiding-places,
she said gently:
</p>

<p>
<q>Mr. Carlisle, it is getting late.
Shall we go home?</q>
</p>

<p>
He started from his moody silence,
and, taking in his the hand
that rested on the cross, he said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Assunta, you are a noble girl;
but,</q> he added with a faint smile,
<q>this conclusion does not make
your words easier to bear. But
you are shivering. Is it so cold?
Come, we will go at once.</q> And
as he led the way towards the carriage,
he wrapped her shawl closer
about her, saying, <q>My poor child,
how thoughtless I have been!</q>
</p>

<p>
Once seated, there was again silence
until they reached the entrance
of the villa. As they ascended
the long stair-case, Mr.
Carlisle paused. His old tenderness
of manner had all returned,
and he was her guardian, and nothing
more, as he said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Assunta, I have not been generous.
I have taken an unfair
advantage of my position, and have
told you what I had not intended
you should know until you were
released from all obligation to me.
My child, will you trust your
friend and guardian to be only that
until next August shall make you
free? I cannot promise to give up
all hope, but I will not repeat
what I have said to-night. Can
you forgive me so far as to go back
to our old relations? Will you
trust me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Most gladly,</q> said Assunta.
<q>I feel as if my friend, whom I had
mourned as lost, has been restored
to me. And, Mr. Carlisle, the day
will come when we will both look
back without regret upon the decision
which was made to-night
under the shadow of the cross.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I hope so, even while I doubt,
fair prophetess.</q>
</p>

<p>
But his thought was of the time
when he might even yet win that
stern conscience to his views, and
then indeed he could afford to think
without regret of a past disappointment;
while she was thinking of
that sweet providence of God
which, in compensation for sacrifice,
always lets us see in the end
that all things are for the best to
those who can wait and trust.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carlisle opened the drawing-room
door, and entered an apartment
which had the rare combination
of elegance and comfort, of
art and home. Mrs. Grey, his
pretty, widowed sister, was fond of
what she called the <q>dim religious,</q>
and therefore the candles were not
lighted; but a blazing wood-fire
contributed light as well as warmth,
<pb n='773'/><anchor id='Pg773'/>
while the silver urn upon the side
table hissed out an impatient welcome.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Grey herself was lying upon
the sofa in the most charmingly
artistic costume and attitude; and
the injured manner she assumed
rather added to her fascination.
She idolized her only brother; and
when, after a short wedded happiness
of two years, he had offered
the childless widow a home with
him, she had gladly accepted; and
after a few months of becoming
weeds and retirement, she was so
far consoled as to mitigate her
crape, and allow her brother's visitors
to gaze from a distance upon
her charms. The mitigating process
had gone on until she was
now the gayest of the gay, except
when an occasional headache reminded
her that she was mortal,
and others that amiability is not
to be found in perfection in this
world any more than any other
virtue. She was too frivolous to
satisfy her brother's deeper nature,
but he was as fond of her as her
affection for him deserved. She
had taken the orphan Assunta into
her heart as if she had been a sister;
though she insisted that the
position of matron to a beautiful
young girl was no sinecure.
</p>

<p>
<q>Really, Severn,</q> she exclaimed,
as he seated himself beside the
sofa, <q>you must have thought it
very entertaining for me to stay
alone five mortal hours with only
my poor head for company.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Dear Clara, if I had dreamed
you would be doomed to such a
dearth of companionship, I should
not have gone at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hush! No impertinence,</q> she
said. <q>Where have you left Assunta?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Here I am,</q> said the young
girl, entering the room at the same
moment, and answering for herself.
<q>And how is your head,
Clara? I hope you have not been
suffering all this time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Your sympathy is very pretty
and pleasing, Assunta; but, indeed,
it is of too mushroom a growth
to be very consoling. Confess
that this is the first time I have
been in your thoughts since you
left the house. But,</q> she exclaimed,
suddenly recollecting herself,
<q>you have been out alone all this
time. Dear me! I hope you did
not meet any one you knew, for
what would they think? Where
have you been?</q> And as she
spoke, she rose from the couch,
and went about the womanly occupation
of making tea.
</p>

<p>
<q>We went to the Colosseum,</q> replied
her brother; <q>and truly the
night was so lovely that if it had
not been for you and your head,
who knows but we might have
wandered about until the Roman
police lighted upon us, and committed
us to the care of the Holy
Office as vagabonds?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nonsense! I would risk you
with Assunta anywhere, as far as
that is concerned. She is Papal
protection in herself. She is wrapped
about in the yellow and white,
metaphorically speaking. Besides,
I believe it is not exactly the
province of the Holy Office to deal
with vagabonds, but with heretics.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And what am I?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! I don't know anything
about religion. Has Assunta been
calling you a heretic?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Assunta never calls me hard
names,</q> he answered, and he could
not forbear adding under his
breath: <q>But she has made me
count the cost of unbelief.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Has she been trying to convert
you?</q> asked his persistent sister.
</p>

<pb n='774'/><anchor id='Pg774'/>

<p>
<q>She has offered me every inducement,</q>
was his reply.
</p>

<p>
<q>Assunta, here is your tea,</q>
called Mrs. Grey; for the young
girl had been arranging her music
in another part of the large drawing-room
during the conversation.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes; and she needs it very
much, poor child,</q> said Mr. Carlisle,
placing a chair for her. <q>I
was so selfish that I did not even
notice it was cold until she was
quite chilled through. You find
your own head such poor company
that you must go with us next
time, Clara, and take better care
of us.</q>
</p>

<p>
And then they relapsed into a
quiet tea-drinking; after which,
and the removal of the various articles
which constitute the tea service,
Mrs. Grey returned to her
sofa, while Assunta went to the
piano, and played some of Mendelssohn's
<q>Songs without Words,</q> and
Mr. Carlisle sat in deep thought before
the fire.
</p>

<p>
It was a state of things which
Clara could not endure long. Anything
like constraint gave her the
sensation of a caged bird, and she
began at once to beat her wings
against imaginary bars.
</p>

<p>
<q>I never knew such stupid people.
Severn, do please light my
candle. I am sure I trust my
dreams will be more agreeable, or I
shall die of <foreign rend='italic'>ennui</foreign>. Good-night,
dear Assunta. Do not fatigue me
by your efforts to rival the larks in
early rising, if you have any mercy.</q>
And looking the very picture of
lovely discontent&mdash;if so paradoxical
an expression may be allowed&mdash;she
retired to her own room.
</p>

<p>
Assunta extended her hand as
usual to her guardian. He held it
a moment, and then said: <q>Good-night,
<foreign rend='italic'>petite</foreign>; we will begin anew to-morrow</q>;
and then he returned to
his arm-chair, which he did not
leave for many hours. Assunta
was very tired; but it was rather
with the weight of the cross she
had lifted upon her shoulders than
from any physical fatigue. She
soon dismissed her maid, and, like a
victorious soldier wearied with the
conflict, she fell into a dreamless
sleep, not, however, until she had
returned thanks for the victory to
the God of battles.
</p>

<div>
<head>II. Cor Cordium.</head>

<p>
It was an established custom of
the household of Villa Moroni to
be quite independent of each other
until the twelve o'clock breakfast
afforded occasion for an agreeable
reunion. However pleasant an
early family gathering may be in
many home circles, where the
habits and pursuits of all are entirely
dissimilar and incongruous
we escape much of the roughness
of life by not attempting too early
an interchange of forced courtesy.
Indeed, in Mr. Carlisle's family it
would have been difficult to effect
an earlier meeting than the one
which suited all parties so well.
Mrs. Grey declared that the morning
hours with Morpheus were absolutely
necessary to her peace of
mind. And certainly the drowsy
god must have been lavish of
bright visions during those hours
when the sun was so carefully excluded
from the apartment of the
fair sleeper; for when at last he
permitted the pretty lady to awake
from her dreams, she came from
the hands of her maid into the
outer world the very quintessence
<pb n='775'/><anchor id='Pg775'/>
of amiability and freshness. Who
would feel assured of such a result
had she seen the sun rise? True,
it might occur to some persons who
take severe views of life to wonder
what her soul was doing all that
time; but it never did to her. The
supernatural was to her a <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>terra incognita</foreign>.
She had skimmed over her sorrow
as sea-birds over the waves of
the ocean, scarcely bearing away a
drop on their spread wings. The
waters had never gone over her soul
and forced her to cry from out of
the depths to the God whom she acknowledged
in theory, but persistently
ignored in practice. Yet she
was so lovely and affectionate, and
besides, when she chose to exert
herself, she had so much good
sense withal, by all means let her
enjoy life's sunshine, and pluck its
sweetest roses, carefully guarding
her dainty fingers from contact
with the hidden thorns. But why
waste our time in moralizing over
one who would smile in unconsciousness
of our meaning if we
uttered our thoughts aloud, and
charm the frown from our brow by
some pretty petulance?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carlisle understood as little
of the supernatural as his frivolous
sister. But he had a deep, earnest
nature, which could not be satisfied
with the mere outside of life.
Mental food he must have, though
it may be a question whether the
mind is ever fully nourished when
the soul is starving. He therefore,
after taking his coffee and
smoking his cigar, devoted his
morning hours to reading or writing
in the cosey little room he
used as a library.
</p>

<p>
The carriage was thus left at Assunta's
disposal; and she usually
availed herself of it to assist at
Mass, accompanied by her maid;
and often an errand of mercy or
charitable visit was accomplished
before her return. It was her
guardian's wish that she should
never walk about the city, unless
accompanied by himself, else she
would many times have preferred
to show her American independence
by taking a morning stroll
with her faithful Marie.
</p>

<p>
The morning after the eventful
visit to the Colosseum was Friday,
and on that day Assunta was accustomed
to make her confession
and receive Holy Communion. She
awoke with a stunned feeling, as
if recovering from a blow. It was
still very early, but, remembering
the duties before her, she arose
quickly. She was so glad that it
was Friday; for good F. Joseph
would certainly be in the confessional;
as he always expected her,
and she felt the need of his counsel.
It was the same F. Joseph
du Pont who had placed her beside
her dying mother, but who
had shortly afterwards returned to
Rome. When, a few weeks since,
she had arrived in the Eternal City,
he had welcomed her as a dear
child, and she loved and respected
him as a true spiritual father. The
sun was just rising when she entered
the carriage and drove to the
Gesù. Her confession was soon
made, and after the Precious Blood
had poured its healing drops upon
her soul through the words of the
absolution, she said: <q>Father, can
you spare me a few minutes more
this morning? I want your advice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly, my child,</q> answered
the good priest. <q>It is nearly an
hour before my Mass. How can I
help you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Last evening,</q> said Assunta in
a low voice, <q>I did what I believed
to be right; but the morning light
has only confused my mind, and I
<pb n='776'/><anchor id='Pg776'/>
see nothing clearly. Father, Mr.
Carlisle, my guardian, asked me to
marry him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And you, my child?</q> questioned
the priest somewhat anxiously.
</p>

<p>
<q>I had been prepared somewhat
to expect it. I had thought of my
mother's request, and remembered
that it was in accordance with the
teaching of the church, and I was
impelled to fortify myself by a
promise to Almighty God to fulfil
to the letter my dear mother's wish.
Therefore, when the question came,
I could only refuse.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It cost you something to do
this, I can see, my poor child, and
this morning you are suffering from
the revenge our human nature
takes upon us when we have done
it violence. Let us look at the
matter calmly before God. I believe
that you are right, but it will
help you to look at both sides of
the question. It is a reasonable
service that God requires of us;
and, be very sure, he never leads
us to the altar of sacrifice without
bestowing upon us the strength
and generosity we need to place
our offering upon it. Perhaps you
were a little too impulsive in binding
yourself by anything like a vow.
We must always be very careful
not to mistake impulse for inspiration.
However, as I understand
you, your mind was already decided,
and the promise to God was
to act as a protection to yourself
against your own human weakness.
Am I right?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Partly, father,</q> replied Assunta,
<q>and yet, as I knelt before the
Blessed Sacrament, I felt that the
sacrifice was required of me in a
way I thought I could not mistake.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then, my child, doubtless the
Holy Spirit has inspired it for some
end that we do not now see. But,
aside from that, without that additional
and conclusive obstacle in
the way of such a marriage, I think
you acted rightly. Our holy mother,
the church, is very wise, as
well as very lenient; and it is with
great reluctance that she risks the
soul of one of her precious children
by placing it under the constant
influence of one without faith.
It is very true that while there is
wisdom in knowing how to keep a
rule, there is still greater wisdom in
knowing when judiciously to make
the exception. And I confess that,
from a human point of view, yours
would seem to be an exceptional
case. You are quite alone in the
world; and your guardian has been,
and no doubt would always be, a
faithful friend. As a man, I esteem
him highly for his many noble qualities.
The world will unquestionably
look upon such a marriage as
eminently fitting; and so it would
be, but for the one thing which is
so important. We, however, cannot
act upon human principles, as
if this world were all. It was not
without reason, my child, that your
poor mother said those last words
to you. When she was married,
her faith was as strong, her life as
true and pure, as yours. But your
father's intellect was powerful, and
her love for him so great that she
yielded to him until she nearly lost
her soul. God be blessed for his
mercy, she had the grace to die as a
saint, and is now, as I hope, in heaven.
But I have seen her in an
agony of remorse such as I should
grieve indeed to witness in this
dear child of hers. The last two
years of her life after her return to
her faith were truly years of martyrdom,
passed in the struggle to
reconcile those duties which never
should conflict&mdash;her love of God
and duty to her husband. It was
<pb n='777'/><anchor id='Pg777'/>
from the very depths of her own
sad experience that she pleaded
with her little girl. My child, that
mother is praying for you now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I believe it, father,</q> said Assunta,
deeply moved by this story of
her beloved mother, which she
heard for the first time.
</p>

<p>
<q>So, my child, the past is all as
it should be; and now for the future.
May God grant you the
grace to be always as good and
brave as you were last night! I
would not discourage you, and yet
I must remind you that the sacrifice
is only begun. It is not likely
that your guardian, with only human
motives to urge him, will give
up so easily where his heart is engaged.
He will, of course, do all
he can to turn you from your purpose,
and no doubt your own
heart will sometimes plead on his
side. Here lies your further trial.
And yet I cannot, as under other
circumstances I should do, advise
you to shun the temptation. You
cannot leave your guardian's care
until you are of age; therefore you
must face the trial. But I trust you
entirely, my child&mdash;that is, I trust
to the purity of your heart and the
power of grace that is in you to
guide your actions, even your very
thoughts. You must try to be as
you have been before; try to forget
the lover in the guardian.
Avoid coldness of manner as a safeguard;
for it would only place you
in an unnatural position, and would
inevitably strengthen in the end the
feelings you would conquer. It is
not easy to give an exact rule of
conduct. Your own good sense
will teach you, and God will be
with you. And, my child, you
must pray for your guardian, and
at the same time it must be without
any future reference to yourself in
connection with him. Is this too
hard for you? Do your best, and
grace will do the rest. By remembering
him before God you will
learn lo purify your feelings towards
him&mdash;to supernaturalize them; and
by committing your future unreservedly
to the loving providence
of God, your prayer will be a constant
renewal of the act of sacrifice
you have made. Make it heroic
by perseverance. Do I explain
myself clearly, my child?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, father, perfectly so; and
I feel so much comforted and
strengthened.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, these are but the words
of your father, spoken out of his
love for you. Go now, child, and
prepare to receive your divine Lord,
and listen for the words of peace
and comfort he will speak to your
soul. To him I commend you with
all confidence. One thing more&mdash;remember
that there is nothing
which helps us so much in such a
trial as acts of charity towards the
poor and the suffering. I know
that you never fail in this respect;
but now especially I would urge you
to forget yourself in sympathy for
others as occasion offers, though
you must always recognize those
claims which your position in society
entails upon you. Come to me
freely whenever you feel that I can
help you. God bless you! I shall
remember you in the Holy Sacrifice.</q>
</p>

<p>
The good priest went to vest himself
for Mass, while the young girl
returned to the place before the altar
where Marie was patiently awaiting
her. She was herself a pious
woman, and time spent in church
never seemed long to her.
</p>

<p>
When the Mass was over and
her thanksgiving ended, Assunta returned
home with her heart lightened
of its burden. She dressed
herself for breakfast with her usual
<pb n='778'/><anchor id='Pg778'/>
care and taste, and, finding that it
still wanted half an hour or more
before the great gun of Sant' Angelo
would boom out the mid-day signal,
she seated herself at the piano,
and song and ballad followed each
other in quick succession. Her
voice and manner were in harmony
with herself. Her music soothed,
but never excited. It had not the
dangerous power to quicken the
pulse and thrill the heart with passionate
emotion, but it roused the
better feelings, while it conveyed to
the listener a restful, satisfied impression
which ambitious, brilliant
performers rarely impart. She was
just beginning Cherubini's beautiful
Ave Maria when Mr. Carlisle
entered the room.

<p>
But as Assunta had already left
the piano to greet her guardian and
his sister, he continued:
</p>

<p>
<q>By the way, Clara, my quotation
has suggested to me an answer
to your question. Assunta, my
fickle sister, who a week ago was
ready to live and die in a picture-gallery,
has just now assured me
that the very mention of a picture
or statue is a fatigue to her; and
she has mercilessly compelled me
to find some new and original bit of
sight-seeing for to-day. We cannot,
of course, visit any church, since
the Holy Father is, unfortunately for
her, not an iconoclast. But, Clara,
what do you say to making a Shelley
day of it? We will take <hi rend='italic'>Prometheus
Unbound</hi> with us to the Baths
of Caracalla, and there, on the
very spot which inspired the poem,
we can read parts of it. And when
we are tired, we can prolong our
drive to the cemetery, and visit
Shelley's grave, as a proper conclusion.
How do you like the plan?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh!</q> said Mrs. Grey, <q>it will
be deliciously sentimental; only
breakfast is announced, and I am in
a famished condition. I was up so
early this morning. It must have
been before eleven when that stupid
girl called me, and it is an hour
since I took my coffee.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Poor Clara!</q> said Mr. Carlisle,
<q>your condition is truly pitiable.
I should think you might find
the almshouse a pleasant change.</q>
Mrs. Grey seemed only amused at
her brother's sarcasm, when suddenly
she checked her silvery laugh,
and, springing from the table, at
which she had just seated herself,
she went towards Assunta with such
a pretty, penitential air that she
was quite irresistible.
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear child,</q> she exclaimed,
<q>speaking of almshouses reminds me
of something you will never forgive.
Promise me not to scold, and I will
devote myself henceforth to the
cultivation of my memory.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it?</q> asked Assunta,
smiling at her earnestness. <q>I am
sure such a pleading look would
force forgiveness from a stone.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, then, for my confession,
since you absolve me beforehand.
While you were out yesterday
morning that miserable woman of
yours sent word that she was sick,
and something about not having a
mouthful of bread in the house.
I forget the whole message. My
maid saw the girl who came, and
I promised to tell you. But you
remember my wretched headache.
You forgave me, you know.</q>
</p>

<p>
Assunta looked both grieved and
vexed for a moment, and then she
controlled herself enough to say:
</p>

<p>
<q>I must attach a condition to
my forgiveness, Clara. Will you
<pb n='779'/><anchor id='Pg779'/>
let me drive to the house on our
way to the baths? I will only detain
you a few minutes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Heavens! Assunta, you will
not go there yourself?</q> exclaimed
the astonished Clara. <q>I dare say
it is some filthy hole, and perhaps
the woman may have fever. Send
a messenger with some money.
I'll give her five dollars.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank you. I will take the five
dollars to her willingly,</q> replied
the young girl; <q>but I will take
myself too. I can easily walk,</q>
she added, looking for permission
to her guardian, as the occasion
was exceptional.
</p>

<p>
Displeasure at his sister's thoughtlessness
was evident in Mr. Carlisle's
tone, as he said:
</p>

<p>
<q>You will go in the carriage,
Assunta, and I will accompany you.
We will return for Clara after the
visit. Giovanni, order a basket
of provisions to be put up before
one o'clock, and be ready yourself
to go with us and take charge of
it; and now that the matter is settled,
we will have some breakfast.</q>
</p>

<p>
Poor Mrs. Grey looked disconcerted;
but she thought it her duty
to make a further protest.
</p>

<p>
<q>You surely will not wear that
dress, Assunta? It will never be fit
to put on again.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carlisle laughed outright at
this new objection, while Assunta
said with a smile:
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, Clara, have you so soon
forgotten your admiration of Mrs.
Browning's <hi rend='italic'>Court Lady</hi>, who put on
her silks and jewels, and went to
the hospital as to the court of the
king? On the same principle I
should be arrayed in purple and
fine linen, for I am going to the
court of the King of kings; and if
I am not very much mistaken, this
same poor woman, whose contact
you fear so much, will find her
place very near to the throne in
the ranks of the celestial nobility.
However, I should be sorry to ruin
my new dress, as you predict, and
I will be very careful.</q>
</p>

<p>
The breakfast was soon despatched,
the carriage came punctually to
the door, and Mr. Carlisle and his
ward drove rapidly towards the
miserable home of the poor woman,
who, in the midst of her poverty,
possessed a faith at which Assunta
often wondered.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are very kind, Mr. Carlisle,</q>
she said. <q>I am sorry I have
given you so much trouble.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In this case,</q> he replied, <q>the
trouble is not altogether disinterested.
I must myself find out what
the sickness is before I can allow
you to enter the house. I cannot
let you run the risk of fever or any
other malignant disease. You see
I came as a sort of police.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But,</q> said Assunta, touched by
his thoughtful care of her, at the
same time anxious not to be prevented
making what amends she
could, <q>I am so accustomed to
visiting the sick, I do not think
there can be any danger.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My child,</q> he said, <q>as long as
your life can be guarded by me, it
shall be done. You are under
obedience still, you know.</q> She
dared not insist; and, indeed, at
the same moment they reached the
wretched dwelling. After exacting
from her the promise to remain in
the carriage, Mr. Carlisle ascended
the broken stair-case. In a few
moments he returned, and, without
saying a word, he took the basket
from Giovanni, and again went up
the stairs. As he reappeared, he
said to the coachman:
</p>

<p>
<q>Drive on slowly. I will walk a
little. You must not go in, Assunta.</q>
</p>

<p>
He continued to follow the carriage
<pb n='780'/><anchor id='Pg780'/>
at a quick pace for a quarter
of a mile; then he hailed the driver,
and took his seat beside the wondering
girl, saying:
</p>

<p>
<q>I thought it would be best to
give myself an airing after leaving
that room. <foreign rend='italic'>Petite</foreign>, the poor woman
died two hours since of a terrible
fever. You could have done nothing,
and, as usual, Clara was mistaken
in the message. They sent
word to their <q>guardian angel,</q> as
they are pleased to call a certain
little friend of mine, of their suffering
and need, but with the particular
warning that she should on
no account direct her flight that
way, lest she should expose the
unangelic part of her nature to contagion.
I left the basket, and
money enough to supply all the
temporary wants of the children;
but it was a dreadful scene,</q> he
added with a shudder.
</p>

<p>
He had striven to speak lightly
at first, because he saw the distress
in Assunta's anxious face and tearful
eyes. But his own feelings
were strangely stirred, and he forgot
his self-control, as he continued,
in a voice low and husky from the
very intensity of emotion:
</p>

<p>
<q>Child, I am in an agony of
terror at the bare thought of what
might have been the result had
you been exposed to that atmosphere,
whose every breath was poison.
My God! when I think of
the danger you have so narrowly
escaped. Oh! if I might always
shield this dear life at any risk to
mine.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My life is in God's hands,</q> said
Assunta coldly, as she gently disengaged
the hand which her guardian
had clasped in his, as if he would
show, by the action, the power of
his love to avert any and every
evil which might threaten her.
</p>

<p>
Poor child! she longed to ask
more about the woman's death, and
especially to express her gratitude
to Mr. Carlisle for his kindness;
but she dared not face his present
mood. However, as they again
reached the villa, she said hurriedly
and in a tone full of anxiety:
</p>

<p>
<q>Mr. Carlisle, you have exposed
yourself to great danger, and I do
not forget that it was for my sake.
I shall not be satisfied unless you
promise me that you will take every
possible precaution to avoid any
future evil consequences. I should
never forgive myself if any harm
came to you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her eyes lowered beneath the
look he for one moment fixed upon
her appealing face; then, with the
exclamation, <q>An unblessed life is
of little consequence,</q> he sprang
from the carriage, and, saying to
Giovanni, <q>I will summon Mrs.
Grey,</q> he dashed up the stone staircase.
</p>

<p>
Assunta sank back with a feeling
almost of despair at the task before
her. Even if she had not to struggle
with her own heart, it would
have been hard enough to steer the
right, straight course between these
contradictory moods in her guardian;
one moment so tender and
thoughtful, the next so full of
bitterness. How could she reconcile
them? How should she ever
be able to bear her burden, if this
weight were added to it day by
day?
</p>

<p>
Assunta possessed the gift&mdash;which,
advanced to a higher degree, might
be termed the natural science of
the saints&mdash;of receiving religious
impressions and suggestions from
the natural objects about her. Now,
as in a listless manner she looked
around, her eyes fell upon the snow-crowned
hills which bound the Roman
horizon, and rested there. She
had no thought of the classic associations
<pb n='781'/><anchor id='Pg781'/>
which throng those mountain-sides
and nestle in the valleys.
She needed strength, and instantly
the words were present to her mind:
<q>I have lifted up my eyes to the
mountains, from whence help shall
come to me.</q> And following out
the consoling train of thought, she
passed from those peaceful Roman
hills to Jerusalem and the mountains
which surround it, even <q>as
the Lord is round about his people.</q>
Then, by a natural transition, she
turned her thoughts to the poor
woman who had just left behind
her poverty, privation, and suffering,
and, accompanied only by that hope
and love which had endured and
survived them all, had entered, so
she confidently hoped, into the
possession of God&mdash;the Beatific
Vision. What a contrast between
the temporal and eternal!
</p>

<p>
Her silent requiem for the departed
soul was interrupted by
Mrs. Grey's bright presence and
merry voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot imagine what you
have been doing to Severn,</q> she
said; <q>but he is in one of his unaccountable
conditions of mind,
and declares that he will not go
to drive&mdash;pressing business, etc. I
am sure we can do without him
very well, all but the reading part,
which had been assigned to him.
It is so late, at any rate, that perhaps
we had better give up the
baths, and drive at once to the
cemetery. You see I have secured
an excellent substitute for our recreant
cavalier,</q> she added, as a
gentleman emerged from the massive
doorway. <q>Come, Mr. Sinclair,
we are waiting for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was just a shade of stateliness
in Assunta's manner as she
greeted the somewhat elegant man
of the world, who seated himself
opposite to her. She would gladly
have been dispensed from the drive
altogether, feeling as she did then;
nevertheless, she submitted to the
necessity which could hardly be
avoided.
</p>

<p>
<q>Truly, Miss Howard,</q> said Mr.
Sinclair, as they drove away, <q>I
begin to believe the ancient goddesses
no myths. Flora herself
would find in you a worthy rival.
It is not often that I have the happiness
to be placed opposite two
such lovely ladies.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Very good for a <foreign rend='italic'>finale</foreign>, Mr. Sinclair,</q>
replied Mrs. Grey; <q>but if
you were to speak your mind, you
would be calling me Ceres, or something
else suggestive of the <q>sere
and yellow leaf.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is a gross injustice, not
only to me, but to yourself,</q> answered
Mr. Sinclair in his most gallant
tone. <q>Have not the poets
ever vied with each other in disputes
as to the respective merits of
spring, with its freshness, and the
rich bloom of early summer? And
permit me to add that neither has
yet been able to claim a victory.
In such a presence it would be
rash indeed for me to constitute
myself a judge.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Unwise, certainly,</q> rejoined
Mrs. Grey, <q>to take into your hand
such an apple of discord. Women
and goddesses are pretty much
alike, and the fate of Paris might be
yours. Remember the ten years'
siege.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah!</q> said Mr. Sinclair, <q>there
you do not frighten me. Welcome
the ten years' siege, if during that
time the fair Helen were safe within
the walls. After ten years one
might perhaps be reconciled to a
surrender and a change of scene,
since even the lovely Trojan's
beauty must have lost the freshness
of its charms by that time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O faithless men!</q> said Mrs.
<pb n='782'/><anchor id='Pg782'/>
Grey, very much as if she were pronouncing
an eulogy.
</p>

<p>
<q>Miss Howard,</q> said Mr. Sinclair,
<q>you are silent. Does our
classic lore fail to enlist your interest,
or are you studying antiquities?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Pardon me,</q> replied Assunta;
<q>it was rude in me to be so abstracted.
I must excuse myself on
the ground of sympathy for suffering
which I have been unable to
alleviate.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By the way, Assunta,</q> exclaimed
Mrs. Grey, <q>how did you find your
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>protégée</foreign>?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She is dead,</q> replied the young
girl, softly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! I am so sorry. How very
sudden! Mr. Sinclair, you were
telling me about the Braschi ball
when Severn interrupted us. When
did you say it is to be?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In about three weeks,</q> replied
the gentleman. <q>I hope that you
ladies will be there. Our American
blondes are greatly in demand
among so many black eyes. You
are going, are you not?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Most certainly we shall,</q> answered
Mrs. Grey with ready confidence,
the future being to her but a
continuation of to-day. The cloud
that might appear on her horizon
must be much larger than a man's
hand to turn her attention to it
from the sunshine immediately about
her.
</p>

<p>
And so, between pleasantry and
gossip, the time passed until the
carriage stopped at the gate of the
cemetery.
</p>

<p>
<q>You have chosen a very serious
termination to your afternoon's
drive, Mrs. Grey,</q> said Mr. Sinclair,
as he assisted the ladies to
alight. <q>I always carefully avoid
whatever reminds me of my latter
end.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me play Egyptian coffin,
then, for once,</q> replied Mrs. Grey,
but with a merry laugh that belied
her words. <q>I will lead you to a
contemplation of the fate of genius.
I dote on Shelley, and so we have
made a pilgrimage to his grave.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You have every appearance of
a pilgrim about to visit some sacred
shrine,</q> said Mr. Sinclair with an
echo of her bright laugh. <q>Lead
on, fair pilgrim princess; we humble
votaries will follow wherever
your illustrious steps may guide.</q>
</p>

<p>
A small, horizontal slab, almost
hidden beneath the pyramid of
Caius Cestus&mdash;itself a tomb&mdash;is all
that marks the resting-place of the
gifted, ill-fated Shelley.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here is your shrine, my lady
pilgrim,</q> said Mr. Sinclair, as he
removed some of the green overgrowth
from off the inscription.
</p>

<p>
<q>Somebody make a suitable quotation,</q>
said Mrs. Grey. <q>You
know we ought to be sentimental
now.</q>
</p>

<p>
Assunta at once rejoined:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'><q rend='pre'>How wonderful is Death&mdash;</q></q></l>
<l><q rend='none'><q rend='post'>Death and his brother, Sleep!</q></q></l>
</lg>

</quote>

<p>
<q rend='none'>Poor Shelley! But I do not like
the inscription, Clara; or rather, I
do not like such an expression on
such a grave.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean, dear Assunta?</q>
said Mrs. Grey, looking at
her as if she were talking Sanscrit.
<q>I think it is lovely. <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Cor cordium</foreign>&mdash;the
heart of hearts, is it
not? I am sure nothing could be
more appropriate.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It does not seem to me appropriate,</q>
answered Assunta; <q>but
then you know I always do have
strange ideas&mdash;so you say. Why
should <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Cor cordium</foreign> be written
over the ashes of one who was
burned in true pagan fashion, and
who, as I think, should rather be
pitied for what he did not do, with
<pb n='783'/><anchor id='Pg783'/>
his marvellous gifts, than loved for
anything he has done?</q>
</p>

<p>
As she paused, a voice beside
her exclaimed, <q>I am sure I cannot
be mistaken. Is not this Miss
Howard?</q>
</p>

<p>
Assunta turned and welcomed
with a pleased surprise the young
man who appeared so unexpectedly,
then she presented him to her
companions as Mr. Percival, of Baltimore,
the brother of her only intimate
school friend. He was tall
and slender, not handsome, but
with a manly and at the same time
spiritual face. His eyes were his
finest feature, but their beauty was
rather that of the soul speaking
through them. Assunta had not
seen him since her school days at
the convent, and then she had
known him but slightly; so she
was herself surprised at her ready
recognition of him.
</p>

<p>
<q>And what has brought you so
far away from my dear Mary?</q> she
asked after the first greetings were
over.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am on that most unenviable
of expeditions&mdash;health-seeking,</q>
was his reply. <q>After graduating
at college, the physician doomed
me to a year of travel; and so we
meet again at Shelley's grave!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> said Mrs. Grey, <q>and Assunta
and I were in the midst of an
amiable quarrel when you found us
out. I engage you on my side, Mr.
Percival. It is about the inscription,
which I like and Assunta does
not, for reasons which are Greek
to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was just going to say,</q> said
Assunta, <q>that <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Cor cordium</foreign> seemed
to me a sacred phrase wholly misapplied,
though I have no doubt
the irreverence was unintentional.</q>
And turning to Mr. Percival with
that sort of spiritual instinct which
teaches us where to look for sympathy
even in a crowd, she continued:
</p>

<p>
<q>I hope that I am not guilty of
the same want of reverence in thinking
that if those words are to be inscribed
on any grave, they should
be written upon that stone which
was rolled against the opening of
the new sepulchre in the garden,
and sealed with the Roman seal;
for there the true <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Cor cordium</foreign> was
enclosed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Mr. Percival, I see that you
have gone over to the ranks of the
enemy,</q> said Mrs. Grey; <q>and if
Mr. Sinclair deserts me, I shall
never be able to stand my ground
against two such devotees.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am yours to command, Mrs.
Grey,</q> replied Mr. Sinclair with an
expression of contempt in his tone.
<q>But perhaps it might be well to
transfer our operations to another
battle-field. Allow me to offer you
a souvenir of the occasion.</q> And
he handed to each of the ladies a
sprig of green from beside the marble
tablet.
</p>

<p>
Assunta quite simply shared hers
with Mr. Percival at his request,
and then they retraced their steps.
As they approached the carriage,
Mrs. Grey very cordially begged
Mr. Percival to occupy the fourth
seat, which he reluctantly declined,
as also the invitation to visit them.
</p>

<p>
<q>For,</q> said he, <q>to-morrow I
start for Jerusalem; and, Miss
Howard, when I am kneeling, as I
hope to do, in the Chapel of the
Holy Sepulchre, I shall remember
you and those suggestive words of
yours.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You could not do me a greater
kindness,</q> replied Assunta, <q>than
to remember me there. And when
you return, what do you intend to
do in the way of a profession? You
see I am interested for Mary's sake.
I know what her desire is.</q>
</p>

<pb n='784'/><anchor id='Pg784'/>

<p>
An hour before, if this question
had been proposed to him, Augustine
Percival would have been able
to give a probable answer. Though
he had not yet decided, his few
days' sojourn in Rome had stirred
up within him a feeling which had
been latent even in his boyhood,
and from the depths of the Catacombs
and beneath the lofty domes
he had thought he heard an interior
voice which whispered to him,
<q>Follow me.</q> And now a fair
young face had made him hesitate,
though, in justice to him, it must
be added that no mere charm of
beauty would have touched him for
a moment. It was the purity and
beauty of mind and soul, which he
read and appreciated, that caused
him to reply to Assunta's question:
</p>

<p>
<q>The matter of my future vocation
will be left, I think, until my
return.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then, with many pleasant farewell
words, they parted; and, except
to mention the meeting to her
friend in her next letter, Assunta
thought no more of the thread of
another life which had for a moment
crossed hers.
</p>

<p>
That evening there were guests
at the villa; and, as usual, Assunta's
amiability was taxed by the repeated
demands for music. As she sat
absently turning over the leaves
before her in one of the intervals,
Mr. Carlisle came and stood beside
her.
</p>

<p>
<q><foreign rend='italic'>Petite</foreign>,</q> he said, <q>I have been
to see the authorities about the
family of that poor woman who
died to-day, and everything will be
arranged comfortably for them; so
you need feel no further anxiety!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How good you are, dear friend!</q>
she replied. <q>God bless you for
it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is your blessing that I want,</q>
said he. <q>It was for you that I
took the little trouble you are
pleased to magnify into something
deserving of gratitude.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Please do not say so, Mr. Carlisle,</q>
said Assunta earnestly.
<q>You do such noble acts, and then
you spoil them by your want of
faith.</q>
</p>

<p>
The word was unfortunately
chosen.
</p>

<p>
<q>If by faith,</q> Mr. Carlisle replied,
<q>you mean your Catholic faith,
I cannot force myself to accept
what does not appeal to my reason.
I can respect an honest conviction
in others when I am in turn treated
with equal liberality; but,</q> he
added in a low tone, <q>I could hate
the faith, so called, which comes between
me and the fulfilment of my
dearest wish.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a call for more music,
and so there was no opportunity,
even had there been inclination, for
a reply. But as Assunta was passing
wearily to her room after the
last guest had departed, Mr. Carlisle
stopped her, and, after his
usual good-night, he said: <q>Forgive
me, child. I have not been myself
to-day.</q>
</p>

<p>
Two weeks afterwards, when her
guardian lay prostrate on his bed
in the delirium of fever, Assunta
remembered those few words,
which at the time had given her
pain, with that agony of sorrow
which can only be aroused by the
knowledge that the soul of one
beloved may at any moment be
launched upon the immeasurable
ocean of eternity, rudderless and
anchorless.

Boston, Mass. June 4, 1874.</note></head>

<div>
<head>II. (Continued.)</head>

<p>
Having settled that plain chant
should have a part, and indeed a
large part, in our choral service, but
that figured music should not be
excluded, it remains for us to say
what figured music is to be used in
alternation with plain chant, or substituted
when plain chant is completely
set aside.
</p>

<p>
Some seem to imagine that no
figured music is suitable for the
church but that which is termed
<hi rend='italic'>alla Palestrina</hi>. They urge the
great fitness of this species of music
for church purposes; for, like
the plain chant, it is ancient, can
boast a long and exclusive connection
with the Catholic ceremonial,
admits of no personal display, is
dissimilar from the music of the
world, never alters the words or
does violence to them, is not only
distinctly ecclesiastical but papal,
and quite as solemn and grave as
plain chant, while it is of wider
range and of far more pleasing
effect. Though written in strict
measure, it follows the tonality of
plain chant. Its origin is holy,
since S. Charles and S. Philip were
intimately associated with Palestrina.
Then, again, it has the best
possible authorization&mdash;that of having
been used for the last three
hundred years by the popes, to the
edification of the whole world,
non-Catholic as well as Catholic.
</p>

<p>
We admit all these claims. But
against the use of this species of
music amongst us there is a fatal
objection.
</p>

<p>
It was written to be sung without
instrumental accompaniment, which,
when used in conjunction with it,
always mars its effect; and hence,
though nothing more suitable can
be imagined for Lent and Advent,
when, according to the rubrics (too
often slighted), the sound of the
organ should not be heard, we cannot
be expected to sing it at other
times; for we absolutely need the
organ to make amends for our scanty
numbers, our lack of proficiency in
execution, to support the voices,
and to give variety to the service.
</p>

<p>
The organ is regarded by us as
essentially a church instrument by
its nature and the associations we
connect with it; indeed it never
fails to arouse in us deeper feelings
of reverence and devotion, and
we cannot do without it.
</p>

<p>
An attempt was made in several
of the German cathedrals some
years ago to revive music of the
Palestrina style, to the exclusion of
the more modern; but circumstances,
we think, have already led to
some modifications of the strict
rules first proposed.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>III.</head>

<p>
Practically, we can hardly hope
ever to exclude from our churches
modern figured music&mdash;as Benedict
XIV. says, that would be an
extreme measure; but we can exclude,
and are bound, he says, to
exclude, such compositions of it as
are unsuitable for church purposes.
</p>

<pb n='786'/><anchor id='Pg786'/>

<p>
But how shall we determine
what is suitable and what is not?
</p>

<p>
Music, it will be said, is a mere
matter of taste, and the adage has
it, <hi rend='italic'>De gustibus non est disputandum</hi>.
</p>

<p>
But there is bad taste as well as
good taste. Moreover, church music
is a matter of principle as well as
of taste, and good taste in this case
is closely allied to principle.
</p>

<p>
Taste is the instinct or habit, or
rather the instinct following habit,
and perfected by it, whereby we
are enabled to discern and detect
what is most proper and congruous
in each province of art.
</p>

<p>
Now, the reason for employing
music in the service of the church
is religious or it is none. Unless the
musical sounds, therefore, subserve
the meaning of the text, they are
better away. <q>Where the religious
song is accompanied by musical
instruments,</q> says Benedict XIV.,
<q>these must serve solely for adding
to its force, so that the sense of the
words penetrate deeper into the
hearts of the faithful, and their
spirit, being roused to the contemplation
of spiritual things, be elevated
towards God and the love
of divine objects.</q> That style of
music, then, will be the most religious
which deals most reverently
with its subject, and gives the least
scope to the play of irreligious dispositions.
Being the most suitable
to its subject, it will also be in the
truest taste.
</p>

<p>
Hence that music will be the
most suitable and the best which
in its construction will correspond
most perfectly with the peculiar spirit
of each festival and with the special
character of each service; which
will most naturally and reverently
render the sense of the words without
changing, inverting, or abridging
them, or marring their sense
by useless and tiresome repetitions,&mdash;which,
in other words, will speak
as distinctly and as religiously to
the ear as the altar, the vestments
of the priest, and the ceremonies
speak to the eye. Music and ceremonies,
and everything connected
with them, should be in the most
perfect harmony, reminding all that
they are in the house of God, and
assembled in his presence to pay
him homage on earth like that rendered
him by the members of the
church triumphant in heaven.
</p>

<p>
Hence, 1, church music should not
in any way recall the world, its
temptations or its pleasures; and
the prohibition made by popes and
councils against the introduction
into the church of compositions
written originally for the theatre or
the concert-room, but with other
words, or of compositions written
for the church, but in a style suggestive
of the stage, is so evidently
just and proper that any one who
objects to it must be wanting in
common sense.
</p>

<p>
<q>Humana nefas miscere divinis</q>
finds its application here. To carry
the minds of worshippers in the
church back to the theatre by the
music is a crime, for it is a desecration.<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Third Prov. Council N. Y.</hi></note>
</p>

<p>
Hence, 2, not even the feelings
of the congregation should ever
tempt the director of the music of
the church to admit what is not in
every respect most suitable to the
place, the time, and the occasion.
Fortunately, we have no difficulty
here in the United States with our
own people. The only trouble is
when we go out of our way to
satisfy the expectations of non-Catholics
who occasionally are
present at our services, or of a few
musicians not otherwise interested
in the services.
</p>

<pb n='787'/><anchor id='Pg787'/>

<p>
Hence, 3, undue prominence
should never be given to individual
singers. It is, to say the least, very
distracting.
</p>

<p>
Hence, 4, the director of the
music should never be willing to
sacrifice the liturgy, even the least
part of it, to the exigencies of the
music, whatever they may happen
to be; but, on the contrary, he
should be ever ready, if need be,
to sacrifice even the most admirable
musical numbers to the exigencies
of the ceremonial.
</p>

<p>
In other words, he should never
forget that music is one of the many
accessories to our public worship&mdash;never
the essential&mdash;and is never
to be heard merely for its own
sake.
</p>

<p>
This is brought out clearly and
distinctly in two decrees that have for
us in this section of country the full
force of law&mdash;a decree of the Second
Plenary Council of Baltimore, and
another decree of the Third Provincial
Council of New York:
</p>

<p>
<q>That all may be done according
to prescribed order, and that the
solemn rites of the church may be
preserved in their integrity, we admonish
pastors of churches to
labor earnestly to remove those
abuses which in our country have
crept into the church chant. Let
them therefore provide <hi rend='italic'>that the music
be subservient to the Holy Sacrifice
of the Mass and the other offices</hi>,
and not <hi rend='italic'>the divine offices to the music</hi>.
Let them also bear in mind that, according
to the ritual of the church,
it is not lawful to sing hymns in the
vernacular languages at High Mass
and at solemn Vespers.</q><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</hi>, No.
361.</note>
</p>

<p>
<q>At solemn Masses singers are
prohibited from so protracting the
Offertory, the <hi rend='italic'>Sanctus</hi>, and the <hi rend='italic'>Benedictus</hi>
that the celebrant is obliged
to delay till they have made an end
of singing.</q><note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Third Provincial Council of New York</hi>, decree
the third. Since this latter decree has been
issued many organists have acted in the most
senseless manner. Instead of composing or
arranging music to which the words of the <hi rend='italic'>Sanctus</hi>
might easily be sung within the prescribed
time, they have retained what they had, and thus
are frequently obliged to interrupt the <hi rend='italic'>Sanctus</hi>
in the middle of a movement, and before half the
words have been pronounced. Sometimes they
continue the movement, and resume the same
words after the Elevation, and then they find it
impossible to sing the <hi rend='italic'>Benedictus</hi>, which should,
as is evident, immediately follow the consecration.
It is true that at the High Mass the celebrant
is expected to make a longer <hi rend='italic'>memento</hi>
than usual, both for the living before the consecration
and for the dead after it, to give the
singers time to sing all the words, but not that
they may indulge in useless and tiresome repetitions.</note>
</p>

<p>
The general principles we have
laid down will be still better understood
if we examine the declarations
made by the church through
several of the popes.
</p>

<p>
The most notable and the most
precious of these are the brief of
Benedict XIV. already mentioned,
and the rules for composers given
by Pius IX.
</p>

<p>
Pope Benedict XIV., in his Constitution
<hi rend='italic'>Annus</hi> 19, February, 1749,
begins by laying down the general
principle that the music of the
church must be so ordered that nothing
profane, nothing worldly, and
especially nothing theatrical, be
heard in it. He repeats this principle
again and again, and says that
there is no one who does not detest
operatic music in the church, and
who does not look for and desire
a difference between the music of
the church and the music of the
stage.
</p>

<p>
He then reminds us of the Constitution
of Pope Innocent XII., by
which it is forbidden to sing at
solemn Mass and Vespers motets
or hymns that are not a part of the
Mass or the Vespers of the day;
that is, at solemn Mass, the only
pieces allowed to be sung besides the
<hi rend='italic'>Kyrie</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Gloria</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Credo</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Sanctus</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Benedictus</hi>,
<pb n='788'/><anchor id='Pg788'/>
and <hi rend='italic'>Agnus Dei</hi> are the Introit,
Gradual, Offertory, and Communion
of the Mass of the day (a
single exception being made for
Corpus Christi, when the <hi rend='italic'>O Salutaris!</hi>
or other hymn of the office of the
Blessed Sacrament may be sung
at the Offertory), and at solemn
Vespers only the Antiphons and
the proper hymn with the
Psalms.
</p>

<p>
He then proceeds to condemn
frequent repetitions of the same
words, and places the chief distinction
between theatrical music and
church music in this: that in the
former the words are made quite
subservient to the singing and the
accompaniment; whereas in the latter
the words are rendered intelligibly,
and the music is made subservient
to them.
</p>

<p>
He next instructs bishops to
banish from the church absolutely
all instruments except the organ;
but with the organ he allows the
use of violins, violas, violoncellos,
contrabassos, and bassoons,
because these add, he says, to
the force of its tones; but he prohibits
cymbals, horns, trombones,
oboes, flutes&mdash;in general, all wind-instruments,
as also harps and
guitars, because all these, he says,
recall the theatre.
</p>

<p>
He directs that while the singing
is going on the instruments must
merely accompany, never take the
place of, the voices.
</p>

<p>
He allows suitable symphonies
when these are dissociated from the
office proper&mdash;probably meaning
the pieces played at the beginning
and the end of service, and to fill
up pauses when the choir is silent.
</p>

<p>
He closes by urging the Italian
bishops to comply with these instructions
faithfully, that foreign
bishops coming to Rome may see
in Italian, and especially in Roman,
churches the public offices properly
carried out, and thus be induced
to imitate them.
</p>

<p>
The present vicar-general of
Pius IX., Cardinal Patrizzi, by order
of the Pope, wrote two letters
to composers of church music in
Rome, on the 18th and 20th of
November, 1856, and in them he
so far supplements the directions
of Benedict XIV. that we have
wherewith to determine without
much difficulty what music is, and
what music is not, admissible in
Catholic choirs.
</p>

<p>
In his first letter he says:
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The most sustained gravity is
to be observed, and nothing introduced
suggestive of theatrical pieces,
either by the arrangement or by
the melody; too many repetitions,
and all changes and arbitrary
inversions of the words are to be
avoided.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>At Mass, Exposition, and Benediction
of the Blessed Sacrament,
and other sacred ceremonies, organists
are forbidden to execute the
whole or parts of theatrical pieces,
or to play in a too florid or distracting
style; and their music
ought to be such as to promote the
recollection and devotion of the
faithful.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As we consider an interruption
between the various parts of the
words of the liturgy very unbecoming,
even when any verse is finished,
as being an occasion of distraction
and noise among the musicians
and hearers, we order that
every part of the offices, especially
at Mass, shall be sung through
continuously, so that the <hi rend='italic'>Kyrie</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>Gloria</hi>, and other parts may each
have a unity of structure.</q>
</p>

<p>
In his second letter he teaches
composers the necessity of their
having for their object the praise
<pb n='789'/><anchor id='Pg789'/>
of God and the devotion of the
faithful, and shows how church
music in its whole construction
ought to differ from that of the
stage.
</p>

<p>
<q>If all composers,</q> he says,
<q rend='pre'>drew their inspirations from piety
and religion, as some of them have
the good spirit to do; if they always
kept before their minds that
their music ought to tend to praise
God in his holy temple, and to excite
the devotion of the faithful,
there would have been but little
need to make rules for musical
composition. But it is only too
true that, in some instances, to the
great surprise of the truly religious
among the faithful, there has been
heard in the churches certain music
unworthy of the house of God,
and showing that the composer, far
from having in view the service of
the divine Majesty and the edification
of his hearers, has only aimed
at displaying his own imagination,
and that he has forgotten the
church and written for the theatre,
not only by borrowing its style of
melody, but also by introducing
portions of theatrical music, to
which he has sometimes violently
adapted the words of the sacred
liturgy. In order that so great a
scandal may not be renewed, and
that those who write music for the
church may have a rule to keep
them within due bounds, we prescribe
as follows:</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>1. Music destined for execution
in the churches ought to be
distinguishable from profane and
theatrical music, not only in its
<hi rend='italic'>melodies</hi>, but also in its whole character;
hence</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>2. Those movements are forbidden
which would not be naturally
inspired by the sacred character
of the words, and which would
be suggestive of the theatre.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>3. We forbid too lively or exciting
movements; if the words
require cheerfulness and joy, let it
be expressed by the sweetness of
religious mirth, and not by the unbridled
liveliness of the dance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>4. In all movements, whether
slow or quick, the words of the sacred
text must be pronounced clearly,
and never more quickly than in
ordinary discourse.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>5. The words must be put to music
in the order which they occupy
in the sacred text. When the sense
has been entirely expressed, it will
be allowable to repeat some word
of it, or some phrase of it, as may
be necessary, without inversion,
without confusion of the sense, and
with the required moderation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>6. All the words must be sung,
and none added nor any omitted.
It is not allowed for one syllable of
them to be changed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>7. We forbid ariettas, duets, and
trios in imitation of theatrical
pieces. Recitative and everything
approaching to it is forbidden; as
also operatic finales, such as are
known by the term <hi rend='italic'>cabaletta</hi>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>8. As regards instruments, long
introductions and long preludes are
to be avoided, whether with full orchestra
or with solos.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>9. Without depriving instrumental
music of the grace and coloring
which art and good taste suggest,
an effeminate softness is to be
avoided, as well as immoderate
noise, which is always tiring and
unbecoming in the house of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>10. The composer must not forget
that <hi rend='italic'>the use of instrumental music
in the churches is in a state of simple
toleration</hi>; the object of it must be
to sustain and enrich the singing,
to be far from overpowering it, or
from enfeebling and deadening it,
or reducing it to a mere accessory.</q>
</p>

<p>
These rules, if adhered to, would
<pb n='790'/><anchor id='Pg790'/>
give us music which would meet
the requirements both of devotion
and of art; nor do they exclude
such variety as the diversity of our
feelings calls for. It could, by its
placid, quiet, and smooth-flowing
measures, soothe and subdue us into
that mood which best fits us to offer
to God reverential homage, and to
make acts of resignation when we
feel the hand of affliction bearing
heavily upon us; but also, by more
joyous and inspiriting strains, dispose
us to praise God according to
the immensity of his greatness, in
joy and gladness, on loud-sounding
cymbals (<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>in cymbalis jubilationis</foreign>),
and send us back to the battle of life
with renewed courage and strength.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>IV.</head>

<p>
But, it will be asked, can this
style of music which we have just
sketched be had? Most certainly.
</p>

<p>
It is true our organists do not
know it; for they are lamentably
ill-read in musical lore. They
seem to imagine that whatever is
published as music for the service
of the Catholic Church is to be regarded
as <q>Catholic music,</q> and
perfectly proper, and they scarcely
dream of looking further than to
the publications or importations of
Ditson, Peters, and Novello, or of
critically examining these to test
their fitness for the purposes of
divine worship. To take the two
best composers of their class, how
few organists have taken the
trouble to study critically the
Masses of Haydn and Mozart. Of
the sixteen Masses composed by
Haydn, there are only four in which
the words are all correct. These
are Nos. 4, 5, 6, and 9. All the
others are consequently defective.
</p>

<p>
In Nos. 7, 8, and 11, although all
the words are to be found in one or
other of the voice parts, yet each
voice is often singing different
words at the same time.
</p>

<p>
In Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 16 the words
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Qui ex patre filioque procedit</foreign> are altogether
omitted. In Nos. 3 and
16 the words <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>et in unum Dominum
Jesum Christum, filium Dei unigenitum</foreign>,
are wanting. In No. 2 the
words <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Qui cum Patre et Filio simul
adoratur et conglorificatur</foreign> are omitted.
In No. 10 the words <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Domine
Deus, Agnus Dei, Filius Patris, qui
tollis peccata mundi miserere nobis</foreign>,
are omitted. In the <hi rend='italic'>Credo</hi> all the
words from <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>et in unum Dominum</foreign>
as far as <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>per quem omnia facta sunt</foreign>
(inclusive), and again all the last
part of the <hi rend='italic'>Credo</hi> from <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>et in Spiritum</foreign>
to the end, are altogether omitted.
</p>

<p>
In No. 12 the words <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Qui tollis
peccata mundi</foreign> (<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>secundo</foreign>) are omitted.
</p>

<p>
In No. 13 the words <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Jesu Christe,
Domine Deus</foreign>, are omitted. The
words <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Filius Patris</foreign> are immediately
followed by <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>miserere nobis, quoniam
tu solus</foreign>, etc.
</p>

<p>
Again, in the <hi rend='italic'>Credo</hi> of this same
Mass, after the words <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>et invisibilium</foreign>
we find the text read thus: <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>credo per
quem omnia</foreign>, etc., with all the intermediate
part left out. No. 14 consists
of a <hi rend='italic'>Kyrie</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>Gloria</hi> only.
In the <hi rend='italic'>Gloria</hi> the words <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Qui tollis
peccata mundi, suscipe</foreign>, etc., <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>qui sedes</foreign>,
etc., are omitted. In No. 15 the
words <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Qui tollis peccata mundi</foreign> (<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>secundo</foreign>)
are omitted. In the <hi rend='italic'>Credo</hi> of
this Mass, beginning with <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Et resurrexit</foreign>,
different words are sung simultaneously
by each part, as remarked
above of Nos. 7, 8, and 11.
</p>

<p>
While it cannot be denied that
much of the Mass music of Haydn
is the most beautiful in the world,
some of it is trivial and undevotional,
and it would seem as if, by
some of his movements, he wished
to

<p>
Concerning the sacred compositions
<pb n='791'/><anchor id='Pg791'/>
of Mozart, a recent French
author, M. Felix Clement,<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Histoire Générale de la Musique Religieuse.</hi></note> makes
the following startling assertion:
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The religious musical compositions
of Mozart are much less
numerous than is generally believed,
and the catalogues of music
publishers and the repertories of
<hi rend='italic'>maîtres de chapelle</hi> are not to be
trusted. Many of these musicians
frequently take the liberty of stealing
from Mozart's operas, and even
from his compositions for instruments,
and of adapting them to
a Latin text, let the adaptations
be worth what they may....
The only authentic religious compositions
of Mozart are the following:</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>A <hi rend='italic'>Stabat mater</hi> for four voices,
without instruments, and very short.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>A <hi rend='italic'>Veni Sancte Spiritus</hi> for four
voices, two violins, two hautboys,
two horns, a clarinet, tympanum,
alto, and violoncello.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>A solemn Mass for four voices,
two violins, two hautboys, two altos,
four clarinets, and tympanum,
1768.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>A short Mass for four voices and
the same accompaniment, 1768.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>A Grand Offertory for four
voices and similar accompaniment,
1768.</q>
</p>

<p>

There are adaptations in many of
Peters' publications that are simply
shocking, and even our most worthy
Anthony Werner forgot himself
while he was compiling the <hi rend='italic'>Memorare</hi>
and the <hi rend='italic'>Cantate</hi>, and inserted
a few compositions that are out of
rule, and therefore out of taste.
</p>

<p>
Again, few organists amongst us
have a sufficient knowledge of
Latin, of the structure of the ritual,
and of the traditions of the church
to judge of the appropriateness of
compositions; and the evil is aggravated
to the last degree by the
custom of making the organist the
director of the music as well.
Hardly any of them know either
the theory or the practice of plain
chant.
</p>

<p>
Music of the kind we have described
as fit for church use abounds
in Italy, but mostly in the condition
of MS. The works of the
Augustan age of Italian music, from
the time of Carissimi to that of
Jommelli, including those of Durante,
Leo, Clari, Steffani, Martini, and
Pergolesi, and even of later masters,
like Terziani, afford inexhaustible
treasures almost entirely neglected.
</p>

<p>
The new order of things in Italy
has wrought and is working mischief
there in more ways than one.
Thus it has already been the occasion
of the loss of a great number
of valuable musical manuscripts,
and unfortunately the end is not
yet. The revolution of 1848 caused
a great deal of wanton destruction,
the result of that spirit of
vandalism which seems to possess
all revolutionists; and the recent
suppression of so many churches
by the Italian government has
brought about the dispersion and
consequent loss of the manuscripts
of as many musical libraries&mdash;a
loss that can never be repaired.
</p>

<p>
If we do not resume the execution
of the compositions of the older
masters, we must at least recur
to them for the purposes of study.
In no other way can we shake off
the influence of the drama.
</p>

<p>
We have learned from the instructions
of Benedict XIV. and
the cardinal vicar of Pius IX. that
there is a distinction between the
music of the stage and that of the
<pb n='792'/><anchor id='Pg792'/>
church, and that this distinction is
based on the fact that in the latter
the music must be written to suit
the words of the sacred text, and
that the music, whilst having that
serious and chastened expression
which befits the language of devotion,
should be distinctively vocal
and choral; whereas in the former
the tendency is to make the words
suit the modulations of the music,
to subordinate the voices to the
rich and powerful instrumental
symphony which accompanies them,
to flatter the popular ear by light
and taking airs, and to display to
the best advantage the voices of
individual singers and their wonderful
execution.
</p>

<p>
These characteristics of secular
music, due to the influence first of
Mozart and afterwards of Rossini
more than to that of any other
composers, have been too long felt
in the music of the church, and
to be rid of them we must lean more
towards the past, and return to the
study of those grave and solemn
forms which existed prior to their
day, and in which the instrumental
accompaniment contained no suggestion
of levity, and was used to
support and enrich the vocal harmony
without drawing attention
from it.
</p>

<p>
The celebrated Robert Franz is
now editing some of the works of
Durante, who flourished not long
after the departure from Palestrina
was made, and whose piety and
exclusive devotedness to church
music have given a more ecclesiastical
character to his compositions
than to those of any other composer
of his day.
</p>

<p>
In France the war between
those who advocate the exclusive
use of plain chant and those who
plead that music may have some
share in the divine service is waged
fiercely, and the consequence is
that both parties go to extremes,
and both assert principles with regard
to the respective merits of the
two styles that are utterly untenable.
There is no country in the
world where plain chant is so much
sung, and none where so much
wretched stuff is palmed off as sacred
music. Nevertheless, France
has composers of merit, who might
achieve great results if they had a
public of broader views to write
for, chief among whom is Gounod,
who, in his <hi rend='italic'>Messe Solennelle</hi> and his
<hi rend='italic'>Ave Verum</hi>, has struck the right
chord, and proved himself able to
write sacred music for great occasions,
in which all the resources of
modern art may be combined with
a solemnity and an expression of
piety not less remarkable than that
which we find in the compositions
of Palestrina.
</p>

<p>
In England the advocates of
what we may call the canonical
style of church music are not inactive.
</p>

<p>
The late Cardinal Wiseman had
an excellent collection of Palestrina
music, published in the most elegant
style by Burns.
</p>

<p>
Years ago Monsignor Newsham,
at the cardinal's suggestion, composed
for smaller choirs four chorus
Masses, to be sung in unison or
in parts <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>ad libitum</foreign>. They are easy,
flowing, and very devotional, and
strictly in rule. They are published
by Novello.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Richardson, an excellent
musician, has revised some of the
Masses of Haydn and Mozart, and,
without altering substantially the
music of these two great composers,
reset the words with rare
skill; so that we have all the beauty
of the music, while the text of
the Mass does not suffer. They
are published by Burns &amp; Oates.
</p>

<pb n='793'/><anchor id='Pg793'/>

<p>
Of late years Archbishop Manning
has had a series of six Masses
composed by excellent musicians,
chiefly for unison singing, but they
may also be sung alternately in
parts. They have a full and artistic
organ accompaniment, and are so
arranged that the effect produced
by them is scarcely inferior to that
of vocal part music, while they are
not hard to learn, and do not overtax
the voices.
</p>

<p>
He has also had other Masses
published <hi rend='italic'>for four voices</hi> in the
highest style of art. These are
by eminent composers, and have
organ <hi rend='italic'>obbligato</hi> accompaniment.
They are full without being of inconvenient
length.
</p>

<p>
In these, as in the preceding
Masses, the <hi rend='italic'>Sanctus</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>Benedictus</hi>
in no case exceed the proper limits.
</p>

<p>
They are published by Burns &amp;
Oates.
</p>

<p>
Other compositions of the same
class are promised.
</p>

<p>
Of what is being done in Belgium
we cannot speak so confidently;
but at the last Catholic Congress
of Mechlin the subject of church
music received due attention;
prizes were offered for compositions
that would meet the requirements
of devotion as well as art, and a <hi rend='italic'>concursus</hi>
actually took place, and the
works of the contestants published.
</p>

<p>
It is in Germany that the movement
in favor of the reform of
church music has been the most
active and has made the most progress.
</p>

<p>
We have already mentioned the
introduction of the Palestrina style
of music into some of the German
cathedrals, and four immense volumes
of music of that class have
been published by Pustet, of Munich;
and, as we have just said,
Franz is publishing and drawing attention
to the works of Durante, who
represents the style that came into
vogue when Palestrina was first departed
from.
</p>

<p>
But they have a large and able
society, called the Cecilia, extending
all over Germany, which last
year numbered 7,000, and is ever
increasing. They have at their
head F. Francis Witt, an exemplary
priest of Spire, whom the Germans
call <q>the modern Palestrina.</q> He
is trying to achieve in our day the
success that Palestrina met in his.
</p>

<p>
The number of compositions for
the church published by this society
or under its own influence is immense.
</p>

<p>
A writer in the London <hi rend='italic'>Tablet</hi>
stated recently that by means of S.
Cecilia's Society a thorough reform
had been effected in the church
music of Germany, and that frivolous
compositions in the secular
style have at last been banished
from the churches.
</p>

<p>
The writer of this paper remembers
hearing in the autumn of 1869,
in the Cathedral of Munich, two
Masses of this school, which contained
no passages for <hi rend='italic'>soli</hi>, and in
which the words were treated as respectfully
as in the compositions of
Palestrina and his school, none being
repeated or inverted. The accompaniment
of the organ and the
orchestra, in which no wind instruments
were heard&mdash;except, perhaps,
the bassoon&mdash;was so fully subordinated
to the voices and so perfect
otherwise that his ear has been
spoiled, as it were, and every similar
performance heard since in
other places has been a grievous
disappointment. He never heard
any music more pleasing artistically,
and at the same time more devotional
and proper. It showed that
composers can give us the best music
which modern art can furnish,
and yet keep strictly within the
<pb n='794'/><anchor id='Pg794'/>
limits marked by ecclesiastical authority.
</p>

<p>
The Cecilia Society of Germany
has a branch in this country, which
has recently begun to publish select
music, and to issue a musical
journal called the <hi rend='italic'>Cecilia</hi>. The
editor is F. Singinberger, and the
publishers Fisher &amp; Brother, Dayton,
Ohio.
</p>

<p>
The publications of sacred music
amongst us have not been very numerous
or very remarkable for excellence.
Among the very best we
feel bound to notice the publications,<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Musica Sacra.</hi> Boston: Carl Prüfer.</note>
and especially the elegant
compositions<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Ave Verum, and other Pieces.</hi> Boston: Oliver
Ditson.</note> of Mr. Falkestein,
who has shown that he knows how
to unite in his skilfully-constructed
and charming yet devout compositions
the depth and severity of the
old ecclesiastical masters with the
graceful and flowing melody and
orchestral effects of the modern
school.
</p>

<p>
There is no lack of good-will and
talent amongst our musicians, but
the trouble is that they have not
the models by the study of which
they may form a true ecclesiastical
style. A library is as necessary
to the student of music who hopes
to be a composer as it is to the
student of literature who has the
ambition of becoming an author.
Our directors of church choirs need
a larger acquaintance with the
great masters, especially the older
ones. Above all, they need to have
a better knowledge of Gregorian
chant. For this chant should not
only form a part of our service, as
was already stated in the first part
of this paper, but it should also be
the source of inspiration to those
who wish to compose for the church,
as it was to Palestrina and his followers,
as it is to-day to Gounod.
The language of Mr. Ritter may
be exaggerated, but it conveys a
truth to be remembered:<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>History of Music.</hi> Boston: Oliver Ditson &amp; Co.</note> <q>The
Gregorian chant,</q> he says, <q>runs
like a red thread through the musical
part of the service of the Catholic
Church; this really sacred
song creates in Catholic countries
the first impressions which touch
the soul of the young Christian on
his entrance into the church, and
is, as such, the indestructible echo
of his first sacred associations. As
Holy Writ forms the invariable foundation
of the religious and moral
principles of the true Christian, so
the Gregorian chant ought to form
the ground and invariable theme of
the true church composer; and as
long as composers understood and
valued this inestimable, noble, and
really sacred practice their works
composed for the church truthfully
and appropriately fulfilled their
solemn office; these works were
thus imbued with the sacred character
derived from the themes of
the sacred songs; then necessarily
a distinct line of demarcation was
drawn between secular and sacred
music.</q>

<head>A Week In Wordsworth's Haunts.</head>

<p>
We had only a week to spare,
but we were not long in choosing
where to spend our holiday. At
that time the Lake Country was
accessible, but not yet crossed
through and through, by railroads.
The cars took us from London almost
through to Windermere, but,
that being the gate of the sanctuary,
they went no further. We had
to cross the <q>Black Country,</q> a
weird region of coal-mines and furnaces,
where scarcely a blade of
grass meets the eye; interminable
plains, strewn with gaunt machinery
and bristling with tall brick chimneys
or low, wide, oven-like buildings,
stretch from the track of the
railroad as far as the horizon; a
muffled noise, rumbling and crackling,
is the only sound besides the
shrill whistle of the engine; the sky
is black as with the promise of ten
thousand thunder-storms, the murky
air hangs like a pall over the earth,
and tongues of flame shoot up now
and then from the mouths of the
furnaces. At night the scene is
gloomily splendid; everywhere lurid
flashes leap up from these openings,
for the work is incessant
here; half-naked forms stalk from
chimney to pit, wheeling giant barrows
or pushing forward heavy
trucks on tramways; no sound but
the never-ceasing rumble of wheels
and crackle of flames&mdash;apparently a
silent Pandemonium or Dantesque
city of Dis; at any rate, a sight
that one does not easily forget.
</p>

<p>
Windermere is the largest, the
most fashionable, and the best known
of the English lakes. It was Saturday
night when we reached it and
went to an inn overlooking the
calm sheet of water. The moon
was up, and streaked the shadows
of the great mountains that lay
across the lake with her shimmering
silver pathway; the little boats
moored by the various landings
rocked to and fro in the gentle
breeze, and the wavelets came with
a <q>swish</q> against the pebbly
shore. Next morning, on inquiring
for the Catholic church, we were
told that there was a private chapel
in the house of a Catholic gentleman
who lived on an island in the
lake, and allowed any respectable
tourist to come on Sunday. We
rowed over to the island, and found
it all a garden: smooth lawns to
the water's edge, broad gravel-paths
through groves of elm and
chestnut, a glowing parterre, rustic
seats, fountains and marble balustrades,
and by the boat-house a
little group of gay skiffs dancing
up and down on the blue water.
The chapel was up-stairs, and
there was an outside stair-case
leading to it, down which we saw
a familiar figure coming slowly
towards us. It was that of a London
priest whom we knew, and
who, like us, was spending a brief
holiday among the lakes. He had
come over to say an early Mass;
the master of the house was not at
home, he said, but the chaplain
would be glad to welcome all Catholics,
many of whom came during
the touring season. After
Mass we strolled for an hour about
the garden, admiring the vistas contrived
<pb n='796'/><anchor id='Pg796'/>
between the trees, at the end
of which glimpses of the blue sky
and sparkling water, with some gray
or purple peak cleaving the line of
the horizon, could be seen. From
every point of the lake itself these
mountains strike the eye; for the
most part bare of trees, their lower
ledges covered with green pasture-land,
and seamed here and there
with the foamy streak of a beck or
stream; their summits sheer rock.
Their names all have a grand, free
sound that suits their craggy, majestic
beauty&mdash;Helm Crag, Hammar
Scar, Silver How, Skiddaw.
This one is the monarch of the
lake country. Great How is a
single, conspicuous peak rising at
the foot of Lake Thirlmere, to the
west of the lovely vale of Legberthwaite,
near the high-road between
Ambleside and Keswick. Ambleside
is a favorite resort of students;
young men from the two
universities often come to spend
the long vacation here, where reading,
walking, and boating can be
combined. The scenery is very
beautiful; the valleys are broken up
into a thousand nooks where fern
and heather grow, and some tiny
rivulet trickles beneath the broad-arched
fronds of the bracken;
every old wall wears a golden
crown of celandine, or, in native
dialect, pilewort; the <q>ghyll</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>,
a short, steep, narrow gorge, a
miniature cañon&mdash;is traversed by
the foamy brook, leaping to the
waterfall called in Cumberland a
<q>force</q>; the birch, the rowan,
the oak, cling to the rocky ledges
that jut out over the little cataract,
and everywhere above the greenery
lies the shadow of the great
lonely hills. Black Comb in Cumberland
Wordsworth calls a spot
fit for a <q>ministering angel</q> to
choose, for from its summit, on
a tolerably clear day, England,
Scotland, and Ireland are all three
visible. Many of the mountains,
both in Cumberland and Westmoreland,
have traces of inscriptions
on the native rock which
have by some learned men been
supposed to be Runic, but which
it is now generally agreed to call
Roman. They are very rude, and
much effaced by time and the action
of the weather; hence the uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
It was by the shores of Windermere
that a party of young men,
all enthusiastic Tractarians, spent a
vacation in one of the first years of
that movement now called Puseyite
and ritualistic, but then known as
the Young England movement. In
those days ladies washed and ironed
the church linen, and wore their
dainty fingers to the bone sewing
surplices and embroidering altar-cloths;
while others would take it
by turn to sweep the churches and
dust the pews; and others again, intent
on doing penance, would kneel
for hours on stone floors, and even
use the <emph>discipline</emph> unsparingly, until
the doctor's verdict put an end to
their misguided zeal. Blindly they
were beating about for the truth, and
thought they had found it in practices
of self-denial. It was a touching
blindness&mdash;one that God often
and often enlightened during those
fruitful years. Young men made a
point of exercising bodily mortification,
even in vacation time, and,
when thrown by circumstances
amid unsympathizing companions,
would carry their zeal into the
commonest actions, and make a silent
boast of their new-found faith.
One Friday, for instance, a few
young members of Parliament, assembled
in the lobby of the House
of Commons, called for <q>tea and
toast</q> instead of the unfailing mutton-chop
<pb n='797'/><anchor id='Pg797'/>
of tradition, and the mild
protest created quite a sensation.
On going home they were received
by their several households as
champions of a holy cause who,
from humble beginnings, were going
to bring about a mighty revolution,
a national awakening. It was
very beautiful, this child-like faith
in their own ideal&mdash;so beautiful that
God rewarded many of those who
held it by leading them into the
everlasting reality of the great universal,
apostolic church. The athletic
young hermits of Ambleside
were not left out of the reckoning.
One day one of them strayed
out alone over the hills, with some
old volume of the fathers under
his arm, and his questioning young
soul eager for the knowledge which
the wonderful serenity of this
mountain region seemed at the
time to typify so well. He was out
a long time, and, when he came
home to his companions, he seemed
to them transfigured. A new peace
and yet a more ardent enthusiasm
had come to him, and he spoke in
words almost incomprehensible to
them:
</p>

<p>
<q>I have found the man who has
the idea!</q>
</p>

<p>
What had happened to him was
this: In his walk he had met a
young stranger, and spoken to him.
Kindred thoughts and aspirations
had led them into a long and eager
conversation, wherein it soon appeared
that the stranger, with his
fair, girlish face and dreamy blue
eyes, was the master, and his new
friend only the humble disciple.
They had talked on into the twilight,
and the latter, entranced, at
last asked the name of him who
in a few short hours had taught
him to see things in a clearer, diviner
light than all the patristic
reading had been able to do during
his college course. The young
man opened the book he had with
him, and showed him his name
written on the fly-leaf. It was
Frederick William Faber.
</p>

<p>
From Windermere we started on
our real tour. The native conveyances
are called <q>cars,</q> and hold
four people sitting opposite each
other, but sideways and parallel with
the horses. From a rough, square
box, painted dark blue or green,
up to a real town-made carriage
in the same shape, this conveyance
is universally in use over the north.
Everywhere the same beautiful
scenery&mdash;moist nooks, a natural
fernery, tumbling waterfalls, walls
covered with wild flowers; here
and there an old-fashioned inn
with an old-fashioned landlord, waiting
himself on his customers, and
sitting down to tell them at his ease
all the gossip and the guide-book
lore of the neighborhood, the best
time to go up the mountain, when
it was safe to take a boat out on
the mere, the accident in the lead-mine
last year, etc., etc. At such
an inn, <q>The Swan,</q> we passed one
night, and had an excellent and
abundant rustic supper, not a hundred
yards from the brand-new tourist
hotel, <q>The Prince of Wales,</q>
gas-lighted and high-priced, with
saucy waiters and London upholstery,
and each floor exactly the
counterpart of the other, like a
penitentiary.
</p>

<p>
Ullswater is a stormy lake, a
sort of caldron enclosed in steep,
forbidding rocks rising perpendicularly
from the water. Above
them is a wooded table-land, with
old houses hidden up the slopes
beyond, one a ruined monastery,
with a modern home fashioned
out of a few available fragments
of strong mediæval masonry,
and a sort of museum or armory
<pb n='798'/><anchor id='Pg798'/>
contrived among the standing
arches of a less useful portion of
the building. It was a steep climb
to get to it, and for miles on either
side of the pathway, that was half a
natural staircase, there was no other
road to it. The view over the dark
lake was impressive; the waters,
calm enough now, lay beneath us
like a floor of black marble, with a
fringe of heavy shadows along the
edge where the cliffs overhung it.
</p>

<p>
Now and then we would pass detached
hamlets with their sturdy,
grave population all astir, the women
fine specimens of their sex,
with that frank expression and
grand physical development which
are bred of mountain training and
open-air life. Together with all
the people of the north, they have
many peculiar customs, and altogether
form a race apart from the
inhabitants of other English counties.
The accents of their nervous,
expressive dialect, the names
of their mountains and lakes, the
flavor of quaintness and individuality
that hangs about their life,
somehow suggest the old times of
early Christianity when S. Wilfrid
ruled in York, or struggled inch by
inch for his invaded territory and
ignored rights. Stopping to water
your horses in one of these hamlets,
you may see a knot of men
standing silently and expectantly
round the door of a clean, home-like
cottage, and just outside, laid
on the porch seat, a basin filled
with sprigs of box-wood. The
men are waiting for a coffin to be
borne out, and, when it comes, they
will all fall into line behind it, and
each, taking a sprig from the basin,
will throw it into the grave after
the prayers have been said. Of
course this is a Catholic reminiscence
of the days when the box
sprigs were used to sprinkle the
coffin with holy water, as they are
now in most countries on the Continent;
but, besides this, box-wood
is an evergreen, and therefore a symbol
of the immortality of the soul.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes we would come to a
little mountain tarn, across which
we were ferried, car, horses, and all.
The regular travelling in these regions
is done by stage-coaches, of
which we availed ourselves for
sending forward our slender baggage,
so as to be quite independent
and unencumbered in our movements.
The mountain lakelets,
that are never mentioned in guide-books,
are very beautiful with their
fringe of rushes and boggy earth
starred with white and golden flowers,
and their flocks of teal and
wild duck dwelling in peace in
these undisturbed wildernesses.
</p>

<p>
Grasmere, a village on one of the
larger lakes bearing the same name,
was Wordsworth's home for eight
years, the first eight of this century.
He was born in Cumberland,
and the home-passion that
has gained him his title of Lake
Poet never left him. Fortunate in
his worldly circumstances, he went
to Cambridge, and, though a desultory
reader, took a fairly creditable
degree after four years' study. He
made tours on foot through Wales
and Germany, and published his
poetical reminiscences, though with
little success; but through their
medium he gained the friendship
of Coleridge, his fellow-poet and
life-long companion. He settled
at Grasmere in 1799 with his
sister, who was throughout his life,
even after his marriage, his guiding
star&mdash;the kindred spirit whose approval
and sympathy were the secret
sources of his intellectual life.
Of her he says, speaking of a peak
which they could see from their
<q>orchard-seat</q>:

Song seemed to gush from Wordsworth's
soul as naturally and copiously
as water from a mountain
spring. Some of his verses were written
with a slate-pencil on stones in
lonely places; for instance, in a deserted
quarry on one of the islands
at Rydal, on a stone half way up
the grim mountain of Black Comb,
in Cumberland, or with a common
pencil on a stone in an outhouse on
the island at Grasmere. He <emph>lived</emph>
poetry. Everything with him was a
pretext for verse; neither the commonest
household occurrence nor
the sublimest spectacle of nature
up there among those rocky fells
and green valleys lying under awful
shadows of coming storms, was a
stranger to his ready pen. He says
of himself that

There are few places so thoroughly
fitted for a poet's home as the
lake country of Cumberland and
Westmoreland, yet more so then
than now, when it has become the
fashion to make a tour among the
lakes, even as one does down the
Rhine. England has wakened to
the consciousness of her own beauty
within the last forty years, and a
home-tour often takes the place of
a foreign one; yet to those who first
visited these Eden-spots the rare
charm is gone, for sight-seers have
taken the place of the <q>wanderer,</q>
and regular guides usurp the simple
escort of a stray shepherd whom
in old times you might have happened
to meet by some <emph>force</emph>, on the
cool banks of which he would have
told you, in his racy dialect, the old
traditions and legends of the neighborhood&mdash;the
legend of the horn
of Egremont Castle, for instance, a
Cumberland tale, telling how Sir
Eustace Lucie and his brother Hubert
rode away to the Holy Land,
and the former, pointing to the
<q>horn of the inheritance</q> that
hung by the gate-way, and which
none could sound,
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<l><q rend='pre'>Save he who came as rightful heir</q></l>
<l><q rend='post'>To Egremont's domains and castle fair,</q></l>

<p>
said to his brother: <q>If I fall, and
Christ our Saviour demand my sinful
soul, do thou come back straight-way,
and sound the horn, that we
may have a living house in thee.</q>
And Hubert promised. But out in
Palestine Sir Eustace disappeared,
and, when the news was brought to
Hubert that his elder brother lay
<q>deep in Jordan flood,</q> he said
darkly to the messengers: <q>Take
your <emph>earnings</emph>. Oh! that I could
have <emph>seen</emph> my brother die.</q> He
went home, and whether he sounded
the horn or not none knew; it
was never heard, but Sir Hubert
lived in glee for years, with wife
<pb n='800'/><anchor id='Pg800'/>
and sons and daughters, until one
day
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
and Sir Eustace came back safe
and unsuspecting. Hubert rose up
and fled in silence, and it was years
before he was again heard of; then
he came and asked forgiveness, and
obtained it, and ended his penitent
life in the cloister; so that Eustace's
<q>heirs of heirs, through a long posterity,
sounded the horn which they
alone could sound.</q> The same legend
is told of the Hall of Hutton
John, an old house of the Huddlestones
in a lonely valley on the river
Dacor, also in these parts.
</p>

<p>
Or it might be the tradition of
Henry, Lord Clifford, the shepherd-boy,
whose father lost his title and
estates during the wars of the
Roses. Henry was restored, after
twenty-four years of shepherd life,
in the first year of the reign of
Henry VII., and it is recorded that,
when called to Parliament, he behaved
nobly and wisely, but otherwise
came seldom to London or
the court, and rather delighted to
live in the country, where he repaired
several of his castles, which
had gone to decay during the late
troubles. <q>There is a tradition,</q>
says Wordsworth himself, <q>current
in the village of Threlkeld (in Cumberland,
where lay the estate of his
father-in-law, Sir Lancelot Threlkeld),
that in the course of his shepherd
life he had acquired great astronomical
knowledge.</q> The poet
clothed this incident (as he did
every other that struck his fancy in
that poetic land of the north) in
verse, singing a lay of the Red
Rose, revived at last, the flower of
Lancaster, and weaving in the tale
of the boy's wanderings on <q>Carrock's
side,</q> in <q>Rosedale's
groves,</q> and <q>Blencathara's rugged
coves.</q> The common name of this
last-mentioned mountain is Saddle-Back.
Near Threlkeld, hidden in
the gorges of the purple hills, lies
Bowscale Tarn, where the people
of the country still believe two immortal
fish to dwell. Tarn signifies,
in north-country dialect, a small
mountain mere, or lake. Wordsworth's
descriptions of scenery are
exquisite; everywhere you find the
traces of that personal love of the
places he paints, that patient, detailed
minuteness of touch which only
comes of long gazing on a favorite
scene, and of familiarity with its
every aspect, in winter and summer,
in storm and sunshine, in mist and
rainbow. Every place has some
tender associations in his memory;
the stately fir-grove whither he was
wont

could be distinctly seen. That
friend never returned, but perished
by shipwreck in the discharge of
his duty. Here, too, in this beautiful
lake country, both at Grasmere
and at his later and more celebrated
home, Rydal Mount, in Westmoreland,
Wordsworth lost others
dearer yet&mdash;two of his children, who
died young, and Dora, his favorite
daughter, who died six years after
her marriage. When on his own
death-bed, three years later, his wife,
brave and self-forgetting to the
last, comforted him by whispering:
<q>William, you are going to Dora.</q>
His poems are so complete a guide-book
<pb n='801'/><anchor id='Pg801'/>
to the lake country, as well as
a series of living sketches of the
people of the north, that it is almost
unavoidable to treat them as tourists
in Scotland do <hi rend='italic'>The Lady of the
Lake</hi>, or tourists at Rome <hi rend='italic'>Childe
Harold</hi>. In his day, however, many
popular traits were in full vigor
which now have almost disappeared.
For instance, he says himself
that <q>the class of beggars to which
the old man here described belongs
will probably soon be extinct. It
consisted of poor and mostly old
and infirm persons, who confined
themselves to a stated round in
their neighborhood, and had certain
fixed days, on which, at different
houses, they regularly received
alms, sometimes in money, but
mostly in provisions.</q> In his verse
he describes the <q>Old Cumberland
Beggar</q> thus:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>Him from my childhood have I known; and then</q></l>

<p>
The passing horseman does not
throw him a careless alms, but
stops, lingers, and drops a coin safely
into the old man's hat; the toll-bar
keeper sees him from a distance,
and leaves her work to lift the latch
for him; the post-boy slackens his
horse's speed, and turns with less
noisy wheels out of his path; the
very dogs do not bark at him.

Though we have quoted Wordsworth's
poetry, it is not as a poet
but as a man that we speak of him
here, not desiring to criticise his
verse or to enter into discussions
concerning the judgment given of
it by critics of his own time. In the
Lake Country his personality strikes
you with the same sense of reality
and continued presence as do
the everlasting hills and the changeless
lakes themselves. He died
only a quarter of a century ago,
though his principal poems all belonged
to the first and second decades
of this century. In 1814
<hi rend='italic'>The Excursion</hi> was published, and
the poem which has made his chief
fame was so severely criticised at
the time that one of the reviewers
boasted that he had <emph>crushed</emph> it. A
brother poet, Southey, exclaimed:
<q>He crush <hi rend='italic'>The Excursion</hi>! He
might as well fancy he could crush
Skiddaw!</q> If his verse was coldly
received at first, it was chiefly because
emotional, passionate poetry,
such as Byron's, Moore's, Scott's, and
Campbell's, was the fashion then.
<pb n='802'/><anchor id='Pg802'/>
Wordsworth's was calm as nature
herself, and concerned itself
little with man's history, past or
present. When he <emph>did</emph> mingle the
deeds of men with the loving
touches of his scenery descriptions,
he would choose pure, white lives,
such as would not jar with the
calmness of lake and fell, of opal
sky and shimmering water. Here
is what the legend of the ruined
hermitage on S. Herbert's Island,
on Lake Derwentwater, suggested
to him. The story of the holy
friends is told also in Montalembert's
<hi rend='italic'>Monks of the West</hi>.

Derwentwater is the most picturesque
of all the lakes in point of smiling
landscape. It has several little
wooded islands dotting its surface;
its waters are clear and more blue
than those of the other lakes, and
the mountains round the shore are
less abrupt and naked. Lodore
<hi rend='italic'>Force</hi> tumbles almost perpendicularly
into it from the steep, shelving
rocks that jut out from the dense
forest growth, like the backbone
of a huge black snake wriggling
through the underbrush. These are
the same waters whose sound swept
over the lake and smote the ears
of the hermit-saint twelve centuries
ago. It is, except one, the most
romantic waterfall in the Lake Country.
Below this wooded hill, and
on the very margin of Derwentwater,
stands a little old-time inn, as
clean as a Dutch house, with a rustic
porch and a little lawn before
it, ringed in with chains hung in
festoons from four or five low
posts. In the middle is a miniature
gun, which is fired off every
now and then for the amusement
of the tourists. The echoes thus
awakened among the surrounding
hills are almost endless.
</p>

<p>
This beautiful North Country has
another interest not so romantic&mdash;that
of its mines, which are mostly
of lead. Just across Derwentwater
there is a fine mine, which, from its
convenient position, is often visited.
We rowed across the lake to see it;
but if you have seen one mine, you
will scarcely care to see a second&mdash;at
least if you have no better motive
than curiosity. To us on that first expedition
it was simply <emph>fun</emph>. Luckily,
there was no proposition made
to don male attire for the only woman
of the party; a huge oilskin
coat with an ample hood quite
wrapped her up and protected her
for the downward journey. We
got into a rough box or <q>basket,</q>
preferring this quicker and more
adventurous mode of descent to
the species of chair contrived for
the visitors to the mine, and
were shot down in an incredibly
short space of time to the second
<q>level</q> of what we saw
there is really very little to tell.
The lodes or veins of metal
looked like irregular lines of shining
moisture drawn on the rocky
walls; there was a tramway occupying
the whole of the narrow gallery
that formed the level, and up
and down this tramway, at a tremendous
rate, and with a noise like
thunder, came the trucks loaded
<pb n='803'/><anchor id='Pg803'/>
with ore. We had to squeeze up
against the wall as they passed.
The path was more than half submerged;
we splashed into pools
and puddles at every third or
fourth step, and the moisture
dropped persistently from the glistening
roof. We should have gone
to the third and lowest <q>level</q>
had it not been so thoroughly under
water that the miners had to
wear long waterproof boots mid-way
up their thighs when they
worked there. On going up again
we stopped at the first level, which
looked exactly like the other. We
did not gain much information by
our excursion, but it was a rare
frolic, and we were greatly excited.
Our clothes came out of the <q>basket</q>
in a soaked and streaky condition;
but nobody cared, the
achievement was enough to make
up for anything. Some years later
we tried the same sort of experiment,
and did not find it nearly so
exciting. It was at an iron-mine
in Monmouthshire, near the river
Wye, famed in the legends of the
Round Table; we were let down
the shaft in a kind of iron cage
(the miners' regular conveyance),
which swung unpleasantly to and
fro, grinding against the sides of
the narrow opening, and bumping
us roughly down at the bottom,
where, as their time was nearly out,
the men were gathering, ready to
go up. Here there was literally
nothing to see. The work was done
a long way off, and there was no
time to go there; besides, the place
was several inches under water.
The interest of this expedition consisted
simply in going down and
coming up again, and in the feeling
that we could <q>say we had done
it.</q> What was really interesting
on this same occasion was the
sight of the iron-works and furnaces
at nightfall. The metal was
put into the furnaces at one end,
and came out at the other in a
continuous stream of intensest
light; blindingly white it poured
out, running slowly and spreading
itself into a network of grooves
all parallel with each other, ready
fitted for its reception, where it was
left to cool. Few things so truly
realize one's idea of <hi rend='italic'>light</hi> as molten
metal. There seemed no color in
this beautiful stream, and one could
fancy just such an intense glow as
that to be the very radiance round
the throne of God. It was impossible
to stand near it for more than
a second, the heat was so fierce,
and we had to watch the calm, uninterrupted
lustre from a respectful
distance. This work was going on
in a kind of open shed, sheltered
above to protect the furnaces and
machinery, but open at the sides,
where in the darkness all kinds of
strange groups and forms succeeded
one another. The commonest
circumstances took on solemnity
and mystery in this half-light, the
red flashes from inside darting like
tongues into the fading light, and
making of it all a wonderful, living
Rembrandt.
</p>

<p>
To return to our lakes. We had
seen all the great ones, and driven
across the country in all directions&mdash;through
mountain passes where
the bare crags and bowlders lay
heaped together, as if the Titans had
flung them there to bar the passage
to their fastnesses; through smiling
pastoral valleys where the summer
stream bubbled peacefully enough,
hiding its secrets of roads washed
away and trees uprooted by its
anger in early spring; by Esthwaite
Lake with its solitary yew-tree celebrated
by Wordsworth; out into a
bleak region of gray stone walls and
hungry-looking pastures to Westdale
<pb n='804'/><anchor id='Pg804'/>
(valley) and Wastwater.
Lonely and silent lies the black
mere under its frowning cliffs; no
house, no inn, near it; tourists seldom
pass it, and tradition says that
its depths have never been plumbed.
We got a boat at a fisherman's
hut; it was not often he used it for
anything but the necessities of his
craft. And yet, in spite&mdash;or rather
because&mdash;of this desolation, Wastwater
has made a more lasting impression
on us than the show-lakes
with their pretty activity and cheerful
bustle of tourist-life. Westdale
would be just the place to live in if
the mind needed bracing and restoring;
few places within the pale
of civilization can so truly boast of
being absolute solitudes. We trust
it is not changed even yet. Quite
close, but you would not suspect
it from the grim, rocky aspect of
the scenery, is a little waterfall. It
is in a narrow gully, a mere cleft in
the rock, but alive with a thousand
varying shades of green&mdash;ferns in
abundance and in every stage of
development, broad, dark, glossy
leaves of water-plants, and waxy
spikes of rockwort. The incline of
the waterfall is so gentle, and so
many bowlders jut out from the
stream, that you could almost climb
up this natural staircase; the snow-white
spray dashes all over the banks,
turning to diamonds in the hearts
of the tiny flowers, and to rainbows
on the broad surface of leaves; and
the noise of the waters&mdash;their plash,
their gurgle, or their trickle, as they
strike moss, pebble, or little hollows
round the big bowlders&mdash;seems like
a living voice.
</p>

<p>
Our week was nearly up, and we
were to meet the noonday train at
a station several miles beyond
Wastwater. The road lay through
rocky passes, and was reckoned a
bad one. Our car-driver was
doubtful as to whether we could
make the distance in the time that
remained; for we had been tempted,
by the rugged beauty of the lovely
vale, to overstay our appointed
time for exploration and natural-history
collections. The drive was
sufficiently exciting, a last bit of
<q>fun</q> to end our holiday, and
we jolted over the rough road,
crossing the worn channels of
mountain streams, and noticing on
the steep sides of the hills what
looked like moving bowlders, but
what were in reality small, sure-footed
sheep, white, brown, and black.
The country grew bleaker as we
went on, till at last we reached the
primitive railway station just in
time. We were very sorry to part
with our North-Country driver and
his car, and return to the civilized
mode of rapid locomotion; the more
so as the scenery through which
we flew for two or three hours was
as barren and as desolate as the
shores of the Dead Sea. Gray
stone walls made a sort of magnified
chess-board of the level country,
enclosing small fields of forlorn-looking
stubble or bits of dark-red
ploughed land. It was inexpressibly
dreary, and a marvellous contrast
to the beautiful region, bold
and rocky, or wooded and smiling,
which we had left behind us.
</p>

<p>
At last we reached Furness, our
last halting-place. Here there was
a coquettish little station, gay with
ornamental wood and wire-work,
and with autumn flowers and late
climbing roses, while beyond the
trim lawn stood an inviting hotel&mdash;modern,
it is true, but decked out
in villa style, full of bay-windows
and gables, with green Venetian
blinds and long French windows
opening into a garden. There was
no trace of a village near, or of
any human dwelling but these two
<pb n='805'/><anchor id='Pg805'/>
buildings. The reason was that
both of these were subservient to
the ruins of S. Mary's Abbey,
which stood, as it were, within the
hotel-garden. S. Mary's, Furness,
is one of the three most stately and
most perfect ruined abbeys in England;
the others are Fountain's
Abbey in Yorkshire, and Tintern
on the Wye, Monmouthshire. It
is built of red sandstone, the warm
hue contrasting beautifully with
the luxurious growth of evergreens
all round and inside its arches and
cloisters. The tracery of the great
pointed windows is almost intact,
but here and there the tracery of
delicate climbing plants is so interwoven
with it that the marvel of
carving is lost in the wealth of each
summer's renewed growth. The
church is built in the shape of a
cross. The walls and windows of the
nave are untouched, and down the
centre are the two rows of columns
that divided it from the aisles&mdash;round
Saxon pillars, alternating
with clustered Gothic shafts, a
sheaf of <foreign rend='italic'>colonnettes</foreign> forming one
support. The bases of all of them
remain, though every one is broken
more or less near the base, none
being more than two or three feet
high. Of course the roof is gone,
and everywhere around shaft and
pillar grow tall flowering grasses,
shrubs with bright berries and
spear-like leaves, while a carpet of
grass as green as an emerald covers
the stone floor. There were seven
altars in the church, and the steps
to the smaller ones are even now
marked by the gradual ascent of
the turf. Poking into the earth
with a walking-stick, we soon came
to the stone steps, not more than
three inches under ground. The
chancel and <foreign rend='italic'>sedilia</foreign> are very perfect,
and everywhere the <foreign rend='italic'>piscinæ</foreign> are
visible in the walls. The chapter-room
preserved its stone groined
roof up to twenty or thirty years ago,
when it fell in. On the walls are
the remains of lovely, intricate diaper-work.
The refectory is a long
hall with a row of columns (only
the bases exist now) down the centre,
and the principal dormitory is
said to have been exactly above
this. The whole is now open to
the sky. The quiet cloister, with
some of the old graves of dead
and gone Cistercian monks, is
still traceable, and beyond is a
little enclosed and railed-in stone
chamber, contrived out of the
ruined walls, but carefully roofed
in, and used to stow away such
fragments of sculpture as have
been found within the precincts
of the abbey. They are thus preserved
from the rapacity of tourists.
There are bones and skulls
among them, too. The North of
England was once called the garden-land
of the Cistercians; their
abbeys abounded in that region,
and their power, temporal and
spiritual, was paramount. The abbots
at the head of those religious
corporations of early days had
episcopal jurisdiction and claimed
episcopal privileges, and were far
more powerful than the wandering
bishops who had no abbey to
back their authority. They had
tracts of land and many serfs. In
many respects the <q>villeins</q> of the
church were a happy and a privileged
set of people. They were
not obliged to serve in the king's
armies, as were the serfs of secular
lords, and they could not be sued
for debt or trespass, or any other
local offence. They were immediately
and solely under the jurisdiction
of the abbot, which superseded,
in their case, that of the
common law. In return for their
service, agricultural and otherwise,
<pb n='806'/><anchor id='Pg806'/>
the abbot gave them shelter, food,
clothing, and protection&mdash;not an
unequal bargain, even for our days;
but when we transport ourselves
into the conditions of life in the
middle ages, it will be easily seen
how desirable a fate it was to be
<q>made over to the church.</q> In
those days protection was a greater
boon than even food, lodging, or
clothing; it was then what <q>habeas
corpus</q> and the right of inviolability
of domicile are now; and so
long as the substance existed, it is
idle to quarrel with the garb in
which it was clothed.
</p>

<p>
The ruins were thronged all day;
that was the only drawback to our
enjoyment, but we remedied that at
night. Every train came laden
with tourists to see Furness Abbey;
they walked about with guide-books
and luncheon-baskets, and popped
champagne-corks in the cloisters,
and strewed chicken-bones among
the bases of the great Saxon pillars,
chatting, laughing, and joking, and
evidently enjoying themselves as
they would at a country fair or a
cattle-show. This went on all day
long; but towards night, after a late
dinner at the hotel, they subsided,
and scarcely a soul was to be seen
in the garden. The men were in
the billiard-room, and the women
probably packing their things for
the morrow's journey; so we slipped
out, two of us, and went over to
the deserted ruins. The moon was
up, not quite at her full, but bright
enough to make the scene very
beautiful, and there were many
stars as well. It is not easy to describe
the impression this night-view
of the old Catholic abbey
made on us; one might as well try
to catch a moonbeam, and examine
it and find out what it is made
of. Every one can sketch the picture
for himself; every one with a
love of the beautiful, the spiritualized,
will understand what was its
solemn charm. We roamed about
in silence from nave to cloisters,
from refectory to chapel-room, and
then, hand-in-hand, went with something
of awe in our hearts into
the old chancel, where in the
days of the monks none ever went
but the cowled, white-robed Cistercians
themselves&mdash;an angel and virgin
choir meet to sing the praises
of the Lamb. By the <foreign rend='italic'>sedilia</foreign>, in the
beautiful carved recesses of which
scarcely a stone is out of place or
an ornament broken off, we knelt
down and said the rosary together
for the conversion of England.
</p>

<p>
Presently a strange green light
flashed before our eyes, right above
the place where the high altar had
stood of old; it was gone in a minute,
and the calm radiance of the
moon was still undisturbed. Seen,
as it was, in this dim, silent place of
song and worship, it was very impressive;
and had it been nothing
but what we first took it for&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, a
railway signal&mdash;even then it would
have remained in our imagination,
idealized into something symbolic.
Green is the color of hope, and
where is there more room for hope
than under the arches of a ruined
abbey, once the pride of a Catholic
country, the home of learning and
charity, the representative of a nation's
civilization? We stayed a
long while yet, lingering about the
dusky arches, catching sight of the
starry sky through the Gothic tracery
of the windows, repeopling the
place in fancy with its silent, prayerful
denizens in their white robes
and hoods, and wondering what
that fitful flash might have been.
Next morning we saw in the newspaper
that just at that very hour a
meteor of greenish hue had appeared
and been observed in many
<pb n='807'/><anchor id='Pg807'/>
places all over England. You may
imagine how glad we were to find
that it had been no railway signal
that had cleft the white moonlight
while we were praying in the chancel.
It was a beautiful remembrance
to carry away from the Abbey
of S. Mary at Furness. God
does not forget the places where
his feet have rested, and there are
heavenly, undying flowers yet in
the gardens of Paradise which the
angels fling down on those consecrated
spots which princes once
endowed, because they humbly acknowledged
that <q>the roses and
flowers of kings, emperors, and
dukes, and the crowns and palms of
all the great, wither and decay, and
that all things, with an uninterrupted
course, tend to dissolution and
death.</q><note place='foot'>From the introduction to the foundation-charter
of the Abbey of S. Mary at Furness.</note>
</p>

<p>
So we took leave of the beautiful
North Country, its lakes, its solemn
mountains, its abbeys, and its
hardy, independent people, whose
character has in it yet all the elements
out of which God, infusing
into them his grace, moulded the
great Northumbrian saint, Wilfrid
of York, the Thomas à Becket of the
VIth century.

<p>
Not far from the villa we occupied
there stood an uninviting
house, as it appeared to me, the
<foreign rend='italic'>loggia</foreign> of which was surrounded on
three sides with green trellis-work,
and commanded a fine view of
Naples and the bay. Outside the
door I had noticed barrels of oysters,
as indicative of what we might
find inside. This was the Caffe
Frisio, renowned in Naples, spite
of its unattractive appearance. I
was somewhat surprised when, a
few days after our engagement, Don
Emidio suggested to Mary that we
should all dine there, including, of
course, the Vernons. I remonstrated.
I did not see the fun of leaving
our own quiet, cool house, with
a modest but sufficiently well-cooked
dinner prepared by Monica and
served with the honest awkwardness
of our unpretending Paolino, for
the hurry of noisy waiters and the
click-clack of other people's plates
and glasses. I stood up for my
point with my usual undiscerning
obstinacy until I thought I saw a
puzzled and half-pained expression
come over the usually serene brow
of my future master. Of course I
yielded instantly, and, before I had
stammered out a dozen words,
found I had gone the length of declaring
that my appetite for that day
would fail me unless I dined at the
Caffe Frisio. That point gained,
Don Emidio hurried off (no! I am
wrong there; I never as yet have
seen him hurry about anything) to
press the Vernons to be of our
party. From thence he went, no
<pb n='808'/><anchor id='Pg808'/>
doubt in his usually leisurely style,
to order dinner for us. He was no
sooner gone out of the room than I
turned to Mary a bewildered face
of inquiry, and asked her if she
could at all understand Emidio's
being so anxious we should dine at
a <foreign rend='italic'>caffe</foreign>. Mary's reply was an indirect
one. She look my hand in
hers, and said with a smile:
</p>

<p>
<q>I sometimes wonder, my dear
girl, whether you will quite easily
take to the foreign ways of your intended
husband.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you doubt it, Mary? I think,
on the contrary, there is something
so charming in that strange mixture
of childlike simplicity and
manly generosity which is so remarkable
in the really good and
noble Italians. Emidio always reminds
me of a high-bred school-boy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is even more the characteristic,
perhaps, of a thoroughly
consistent Catholic life from childhood
upwards than of any particular
nation; though I agree with you
that it is generally evident amongst
Italians. Joy is the attribute of
childhood, as distinct from any
other period of life; and a joyful
spirit is one of the marks of hidden
sanctity. But I was not thinking
of anything so serious as this. I
mean that I wonder whether you will
take easily to the out-of-door, unprivate
life which is engendered
amongst Italians by their beautiful
climate, and which makes it not
only a simple, but almost a necessary,
thing that Don Emidio should
immediately think of celebrating
your engagement by dining at the
celebrated Caffe Frisio.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I certainly wondered why he
wished it, but I suppose it is the
custom, and I am quite content.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You will doubtless, as you go
on, find many customs which you
will have to comply with. At Capo
di Monte you will sit in the open
<foreign rend='italic'>loggia</foreign> of your husband's house, instead
of in your drawing-room with
closed doors, as you would do in
England. When you want your
man-servant, you will call for him at
the top of the stairs at least quite
as often as you will ring a rare and
occasional bell. You will order
your dinner, from the balcony, of
the cook below, just starting for his
marketing. And I am afraid you
may very possibly see your maid
surreptitiously laying out your fine
linen to dry on the trim-cut box
hedge which surrounds the geometrical
divisions of your garden. Of
course in your <foreign rend='italic'>palazzo</foreign> in Rome
you may succeed in keeping up a
little more state. But even there,
and certainly in Villegiatura<note place='foot'>A country-house.</note> at
Naples, you may have to make up
your mind to your <foreign rend='italic'>chef</foreign> calling your
attention to an unusually fine piece
of beef in its uncooked state which
he designs for your dinner that
day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you remember, Mary,</q> I replied,
laughing, <q>the man-servant
one day in Rome bringing you in
a beautiful pigeon with an ever-varying
purple breast that reminded
me of the shot silks or stuffs
in Raphael's pictures? You asked
the man if he supposed you could
by any possibility eat it an hour after
you had fondled it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I had to go without meat for
luncheon that day, and the pigeon's
life was spared. I fed it with rice,
and it used to sit on my chest and
pick the grains from between my
lips.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At last it got too bold, and,
mistaking your teeth for grains of
rice, pecked at your lips till they
bled.</q>
</p>

<pb n='809'/><anchor id='Pg809'/>

<p>
What a mischievous bird it was!
When we came home, after leaving
it at liberty in the house, we found
all the heads of a bouquet of violets
that stood in water picked off
and strewed on the table, and all
the pens taken from the pen-tray
and laid on the floor. Finally one
day the pins had been extracted
out of the pin-cushion and put on
the table, and the long, black hair-pins
taken out of Mary's silver toilet-box
and laid on the bed. At
last we noticed a black pigeon that
used to come often and sit on the
water-pipe of the house opposite.
We never closed the windows on
account of our purple pigeon, as
it had shown no disposition to
leave its human friends for others
of its own kind. But blood is
stronger than water; and no doubt
the black pigeon had wonderful
tales to tell of the many roofs of
Rome as presenting eligible habitations,
and of the daily markets
in the Piazza Navona and beneath
the shadow of the Pantheon
as affording an easily-obtained repast
among the refuse. So one
day, when we came home, the window
was open, and the pigeon nowhere
to be found. Nor did we
ever again see the black seducer
sitting on the neighboring water-spouts.
</p>

<p>
After all we were very much
amused at our dinner at Frisio.
We ate <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>frutti di mare</foreign>,<note place='foot'><q>Sea-fruit.</q> The name given at Naples to
star-fish, etc., which they eat fried.</note> and macaroni
dressed with <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>pomi d'oro</foreign>.<note place='foot'>Tomatoes, called apples of gold.</note>
Of the meat the less said the better.
I rarely thought any of it
good at Naples; though no further
off than Sorrento the beef is excellent.
All provisions are, in fact,
better there than at Naples. Our
supply of butter came from Sorrento,
and was obtained for us by
Pascarillo, our coachman's master;
so that frequently, as we passed
his door returning home from our
drive, his wife would hail us, and
hand into the carriage the fresh butter
wrapt up in green vine-leaves.
</p>

<p>
When dinner was over, and we sat
looking out on the sea, I remembered
that Emidio had promised
to tell us the story of Padre Cataldo's
escape at the time of the Italian
revolution in 1860, and I asked
him to give us the particulars.
</p>

<p>
<q>This will be a very good time
to do so, Miss Jane,</q> was his reply,
<q>because we are quite safe at
Frisio from the father's presence.
He does not like talking of it.
You very probably have heard of
the earthquake in Italy that took
place in 1857; though I dare say
the devastation it caused was hardly
noticed in the English papers.
The Jesuit Fathers had a college
at Potenza which was partly
thrown down at the time, and consequently
the boys had been sent
home to their parents and most of
the fathers dispersed. Padre Cataldo
and one other alone remained.
You are aware that Potenza
is the principal town of the Basilicata,
and is the see of a bishop.
There were forty villages in the
same province destroyed at the
same time. The king (of course
I mean Francis II.) had obtained
that Padre Cataldo should be
sent on a mission to the inhabitants
of these unfortunate villages,
not only to preach in the different
places, but to carry relief to the
inhabitants, and to organize the
proper burial of the dead, who
lay neglected among the ruins at
the imminent risk of breeding a pestilence.
He was also to encourage
the poor people to rebuild their
habitations, and to aid them once
<pb n='810'/><anchor id='Pg810'/>
again to gain their livelihood and
resume the cultivation of the land.
He was engaged in this arduous
labor for a period of about fifteen
months, during which he lived
amongst the people with the affection
of a father and almost the
authority of a ruler; for there was
nothing they would not do at his
bidding.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The work accomplished, he returned
to the half-ruined college at
Potenza. There was but one other
priest in residence with him there,
and Padre Cataldo had hardly
joined him when the revolution
broke out. The Jesuits were far
from apprehending any violence at
first from the inhabitants of Potenza,
a great many of whom were
much attached to them. But at
that time they had not had personal
experience of the insidious ways by
means of which the revolutionists
instil their doctrines into the minds
of the unsuspecting. They soon,
however, began to notice that the
<foreign rend='italic'>caffes</foreign> were thronged with noisier
guests than usual, and who remained
till late into the night discussing
and disputing over their wine or
coffee. The few shops where books
or newspapers could be found in
the not highly-educated or literary
town of Potenza began to display
pamphlets with brilliant-colored
covers and dubious titles. The
men frequenting the churches were
fewer, and those that came were
less respectful in their demeanor.
At night the young men wandered
about in file, arm-in-arm, walking
rapidly with what no doubt they
thought a military step, a flower
stuck behind the ear, the hat on
one side, and singing revolutionary
songs in a loud and often inebriated
voice. The symptoms were all bad.
And the fathers were not surprised
when one morning, having noticed
an unusual agitation in the streets
and the piazza, they received a secret
message to the effect that they
would do well to leave the town as
quickly and as quietly as possible,
for the one simple reason that
where there is a Jesuit the revolutionist
is his enemy. The persons
sending this message to the fathers
added that if their advice were not
forthwith taken, acts of violence
might follow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Not very far from the Jesuit college
there lived a priest who had
known Padre Cataldo for many
years, and who, though himself corrupted
by revolutionary principles,
and not in any way an honor to his
sacred calling, maintained a great
friendship and regard for the father.
He had gone on from one thing to
another in his own downward
course until at this time he was actually
one of the leaders of revolutionary
principles in the Basilicata.
He had nevertheless always told
Padre Cataldo that in case of need
he would befriend him. And he
kept his word; for one night, when
Potenza was getting too hot for a
Jesuit to remain in safety, and the
only question seemed to be what
kind of violence against the college
would be attempted, the apostate
priest arrived in his own carriage,
to fulfil his old promise, and safely
conveyed Padre Cataldo to a
house at some distance where he
could lie hidden for the night. The
flight had been so sudden that
Padre Cataldo, who was not likely
at any time to be cumbered with
wealth, had come away without a
franc in his possession. The next
morning he despatched three messengers
to various friends in the
neighborhood to say where and in
what condition he was; and they,
in return, sent him the money he
needed. With this he procured
<pb n='811'/><anchor id='Pg811'/>
for himself the disguise of lay
clothes, and set out to join the Jesuits
residing at Bari. When he arrived,
he found the Jesuits had already
left; and the condition of
the country was such that he was
unable to proceed with any hope
of safety to Noci, his native place,
where his parents lived.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>For many days he had to fly
from place to place disguised as a
layman, and with a false beard.
But even so there was something in
his whole appearance which betrayed
him. One day he was walking
along the street, swinging a walking-stick,
when he heard one man say
to another, as they passed him,
<q>There goes a Jesuit in disguise.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>A lady residing at Bitonto concealed
him in her house for one
night. He left the house before
dawn; but already the rumor had
spread that a Jesuit was in hiding
there, and early in the morning the
brother of the lady, who was a liberal
and the syndic of the town,
came to tell her the people were in
such a state of excitement that if
she did not give up the father, they
would burn the house to the
ground. And it was not till she
had taken him into every hole and
corner of the place that she could
persuade him there was no one
concealed there, and that his assertions
to that effect calmed the mob.
<q>The foxes have holes, and the
birds of the air nests,</q> but, like
their Master, the priests of the Son
of man had not where to lay their
heads. Thus driven from place to
place, and hunted down like a wild
beast, Padre Cataldo at length
reached Venosa, where, as he had
once preached a very successful
mission, he was well known and
much respected. He took up his
abode at the house of some friends,
and the next morning, which was
the Feast of S. Ignatius, the founder
of his order, he went to the
church to say Mass. While he was
vesting in the sacristy he received
a message that the <foreign rend='italic'>intendente</foreign> or
governor of the place wanted to
speak with him. It so happened
that the <foreign rend='italic'>intendente</foreign> was the brother-in-law
of a man who had been
condemned to death for murder a
short time previous. Padre Cataldo
had been acquainted with the
case; and as he considered it had
been attended with extenuating
circumstances, and that the crime
was not premeditated, he had used
his influence with success to get
the sentence commuted to a term
of years' imprisonment at the galleys.
He also obtained permission
for the man, who was a jeweller, to
work at his trade during his incarceration.
Padre Cataldo had not
happened to see any members of
the family since that event, in which
he had saved them from so great a
calamity. Very naturally, therefore,
on hearing that the brother-in-law
of the criminal wanted to see him,
he thought he had come to thank
him for saving his relative from the
guillotine. But on going to the
door to receive him he found the
governor surrounded by soldiers,
who, at a word from him, seized the
father as their prisoner. He was
at that time suffering from fever
brought on by exposure to all
weathers in his endeavor to elude
his enemies; creeping into some
sheltering house late at night, when
the evening damp, so fatal in Italy,
was falling; making his way over
fields and mountains in the noon-tide
heat, and getting from place
to place through by-ways, as he
dared not take the frequented road;
and of course often without sufficient
food. He was put upon a horse,
and conducted by a guard of soldiers
<pb n='812'/><anchor id='Pg812'/>
to a small place called Rionero.
It was a long day's journey,
and his sufferings were intense.
Having been seized before he had
begun his Mass, he had not tasted
food. When they reached Rionero
in the evening, they found a terrible
scene. The revolutionists had entire
possession of the town. It is
said that the piazza&mdash;the large open
place in the centre of every Italian
town&mdash;literally ran with blood.
Strange to say, many persons connected
by family ties with the <foreign rend='italic'>intendente</foreign>
who had so cruelly betrayed
Padre Cataldo perished in the
massacres of that night. I know a
man who saw the father brought
into the town in the midst of the
guard. The insane fury of the
mob at the sight of a Jesuit knew
no bounds. It was the <hi rend='italic'>Ecce Homo</hi>
over again in the person of one
of his servants. He was taken
through the piazza on horseback,
and the soldiers did nothing to restrain
the people. They flung at
him every missile they could lay
their hands on; and as it was evening,
a band of masons were returning
from their work, and, transported
with rage, actually threw their
tools at him, and beat him with
them as he passed. To all this ill-usage
he made no other reply than
by blessing them. Some of the
most violent cried out, <q>Here is
the King of the Basilicata.</q> Did
they know they were parodying the
cry of <q>the King of the Jews</q>?
At length the prison-doors shut
him in from his persecutors; and
as he lay there, bruised all over,
and severely cut about the head
and face, he could hear them crying
out that they would yet get at
him to burn him alive, while actually
they began building up a pile
in the centre of the piazza for that
purpose.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The liberal priest who had been
his friend in the first instance, and
had brought him away from Potenza,
had by this time heard of
his arrest, and immediately came
to the rescue. This, however, was
no easy matter. He was himself
one of their leaders; and, lest they
should accuse him of infidelity to
their cause, he was obliged to begin
by pretending that he shared their
views with respect to Padre Cataldo.
It was only in this way that he
could succeed in getting himself
heard. By degrees he induced
them to consider whether, on the
whole, the burning alive of a well-known
Jesuit priest in their piazza
would be altogether a wise proceeding.
It might get them into
trouble at some future day. It
might be considered an extreme
measure. At length he gained sufficient
influence for them to propose
that the question should be
decided by an appeal to the people.
The general inhabitants of the
town were not a bad set of people.
They were probably not very courageous
in a good cause, and they
were overwhelmed by the noisy
and daring wickedness of the revolutionists.
But when thus appealed
to, their real sentiments
found expression; and Padre Cataldo,
whose prison-cell overlooked
the piazza, could hear the shouts
of <foreign lang='it' rend='italic'>Noi lo vogliamo salvo</foreign>.<note place='foot'>We will have him safe.</note> Soon
after his prison-door was unlocked,
and in the dead of the night he was
conducted by two guards to a distance
from the town, where they
left him. Faint with loss of blood,
bruised, and weary, he managed to
reach the house of some friends.
He lay there for a fortnight, ill
from fever and the cruel treatment
he had received. And it was not
<pb n='813'/><anchor id='Pg813'/>
till some time after, when the troubles
had calmed down, that he was
able to return to Naples in safety.</q>
</p>

<p>
We sat silent for a few seconds
at the end of Don Emidio's account.
It seemed to bring the nature
and qualities of revolution
keenly before us when we thus
heard of what it had done to one so
well known and so beloved by us
all. Ida was the first to speak;
and she told us that not long
after they had settled at Posilippo
with Padre Cataldo, a gentleman
had called to see him on some
business, accompanied by a young
man. Ida remarked that when the
latter came into the room, as soon
as his eyes fell on Padre Cataldo,
he turned deadly pale. As he was
only in attendance on the other
gentleman, he sat a little back, and
no one paid much attention to
him, while she watched him. She
saw he was greatly overcome and
trembled very much. She tried to
enter into conversation with him,
but he seemed too absent to talk.
When at length the gentleman had
concluded what he came to tell
Padre Cataldo, the latter turned
towards the younger man, who
got up and approached him, exclaiming,
<q>O father! how is it I
find you here? I thought you had
died at Rionero. I witnessed the
treatment you received there, and
I and many others believed you
were dead. By what miracle did
you escape?</q> When the conversation
became more general, the
young man, who could hardly recover
from his emotion, told Ida
that he should never forget the
father's countenance, as he sat silent
and calm on his horse, with
stones, sticks, and missives of all
sorts flung at him. The blood
poured from his head; but there
seemed to be a celestial light beaming
from his face which reminded
him of the pictures he had seen of
the martyred saints.
</p>

<p>
We finished our evening on our
own <foreign rend='italic'>loggia</foreign>. It was a lovely night,
and we felt we could never weary
of watching the moonbeams on the
sea, and, when the moon had gone
down, the fishermen's little boats,
noiselessly sailing one by one from
the dense, dark shadow of the caves
where they are moored, and then,
each with a burning torch at the
prow, casting anchor and waiting
for the fish to rise to the light.
From time to time the fishermen
utter a soft, monotonous cry to
each other in a minor key, which
comes floating through the darkness
on the still night-air like an
echo from another world. There
must be a strange fascination in
this life of the fisherman, whose occupation
begins as other men are
laying aside theirs, and is continued
through the silence of the
night on the vast solitude of the
ocean.
</p>

<p>
Don Emidio drew his chair near
to where I was sitting, leaning on
the low wall of the <foreign rend='italic'>loggia</foreign> and looking
down upon the plain of waters,
which so mysteriously appear to
flash an unreal light from their
dark bosom, as if the sea itself gave
out sparks. Presently I heard a
voice asking me if I thought I
could learn to love the world-famous
beauty of the Bay of Naples.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have learnt to love it from
the first moment I saw it; for I
love all that is beautiful. And
when the beauty of this glorious
land comes to be wound up with
the duties of my life, I shall love it
doubly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Say with life's affections too,
dear Jane.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why should I not say it? Of
course I mean it.</q>
</p>

<pb n='814'/><anchor id='Pg814'/>

<p>
<q>Will you never tire of this unmitigated
beauty? Will you never,
<foreign rend='italic'>cara mia</foreign>, have a pining for a soft,
gray day, with the perfumed damp
that comes up from the velvet moss
and dense greenery of an English
copse? Will you heave no sigh for
the pale but varied and most
abundant wild flowers of your chilly
springs, a lapful of primroses, a
wealth of cowslips? Shall I have
you longing after a narrow lane of
yellow sand, the trees meeting overhead,
the meadow-sweet growing
lavishly in the moist hedge, and
the ripe nuts hanging just within
reach, crisp and sweet in their
slippery brown shells? Shall I
hear you reproaching me that the
mushrooms are dotting the Sussex
downs all round the fairy rings,
and that you long to tread the close,
fine grass where the sheep are
browsing, with the little hillocks of
purple thyme scenting the breeze
with its aromatic breath? When
your nerves are overstrung by the
continuous dry heat and the brisk
air of our joyous land, will not your
Saxon nature long for one of the
short autumn days of old England,
when you might walk through the
fields to the edge of the western
hill, and watch the sun sink amidst
yellow and red clouds painted on a
pale blue sky, and then, returning
in the soft wind of evening redolent
with nameless perfumes, feel the
damp like a creamy balm uncurl
your locks and bathe your cheek
as if with moist kisses? It will be
almost dark when you reach home;
there is a low wood-fire flickering
on the hearth, and the steam of
the urn curling up with a scent of
new-made tea. Papers, pamphlets,
magazines, and new volumes by the
dozen from the London library are
there to greet you. And day by
day, hour by hour, in that land of
rapid thought and universal intelligence,
the latest news from pole to
pole finds its way with every post
into the remotest depths of the I
country. <foreign rend='italic'>Cara mia</foreign>, it will not be
so here.</q>
</p>

<p>
There had been a choking sensation
in my throat as Emidio described
the dear old land of my
birth, and brought so vividly before
me exactly those little touches of
home and country life which I
should most certainly not find in
my future Roman <foreign rend='italic'>palazzo</foreign> or in the
villa at Capo di Monte, beyond
the garden of which I could not
stray into any wild woods and barren
but ever-beautiful heaths, as in
England. But there was something
in the close of the vision he
called up before me which turned
the current of feeling and made me
smile. Strange as it may seem, I
felt it was the newspapers and the I
rapid intelligence that I could spare
the more easily.
</p>

<p>
<q>There are good old books I
have never read, Emidio, and which
you have in your library. From
time to time we will get a few new
ones from the teeming British press.
I am none the happier in England
for tracing day by day the progress
of modern ideas. I will turn my
thoughts upon the past. I may
sometimes sigh for the shady lanes
and breezy downs of England;
but I think the imperious beauty
of Italy will hold quite as much
sway over my heart in time. Are
you satisfied?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am satisfied as much as my
jealous Italian nature will allow me
to be.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Are all Italians jealous?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nearly all, especially husbands.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I shall never give you
cause.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am quite sure of that. But
<pb n='815'/><anchor id='Pg815'/>
it will not prevent my being jealous.
Do not look frightened,
<foreign rend='italic'>carissima</foreign>.<note place='foot'>Dearest.</note> I am not going to prove
a regular Bluebeard, like some of
my countrymen. But it would
sound strange to your English ears
to know the intense sense of appropriation
which an Italian has with
regard to his wife. It is true he
adores her; but it is an adoration
which would exclude the remotest
homage of the merest stranger.
He waits upon her, watches her,
serves her. But it is possible to
have too much of that, particularly
when it is done with an evident intention
to prevent the approach of
any other human being. I had an
acquaintance&mdash;for I cannot exactly
call him a friend; he was too great
a fool for that&mdash;who would not allow
his wife to set her foot outside
the door unless he accompanied
her. She was not permitted to
look out of the window, if he could
prevent it; and he actually one day
consulted me on the possibility of
running a railing in front of his windows
inside the rooms to prevent
her getting near enough to look out.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And they did not shut him up
as a madman?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all; though I think the
generality allowed he was eccentric.
The poor woman had a melancholy
time of it; for of course, if
he would not allow her to look out,
neither would he allow any one
else to look in.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well! and how did it end?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The only way any man of sense
could expect it to end. She got
out of the window and over the
wall one fine night, and left him.
The poor thing went no further
and to no other place than her father's
house. But nothing would
ever persuade her to return to her
husband, who grew yellower and
greener every day until he finally
died&mdash;of jealousy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Serve him right,</q> was all I
deigned to reply, being too indignant
to be grammatical.
</p>

<p>
<q>I knew a young girl,</q> continued
Don Emidio, <q>who had made up
her mind she would marry a certain
Neapolitan duke of immense wealth.
Her parents did not object (which
they ought to have done). But
her confessor, that Padre Cristoforo
whom you heard preaching
through the month of May at Santa
Catarina, did everything he could
to dissuade her. The only answer
she would ever make to his remonstrances
was that she should have
a carriage. All life seemed to résumé
itself in her mind in the possession
of that one luxury, with just
the addition of gowns from Paris.
She was married to the old duke,
and very soon after came to Padre
Cristoforo to complain of her hard
lot. He could only repeat that he
had warned her how it would be,
and recommend her to take a
drive in her carriage, and ever
more and more to drive in her carriage,
reminding her that it was for
that she had married. Alas! she
had to confess that even that consolation
was denied her, as her
husband was too jealous of the
passers-by to allow of her being
seen driving out, and that for the
most part she was kept to the
house. It is true he was constantly
making her magnificent presents
of that other great object of her
ambition&mdash;dresses from Paris; but,
as she represented to him, they
were quite useless to her, as she
could not wear them shut up alone
with him in the house. Now, are
you not frightened by this peculiarity
in us Italians, <foreign rend='italic'>carina</foreign>, or are
you prepared for it?</q>
</p>

<pb n='816'/><anchor id='Pg816'/>

<p>
Emidio was laughing, and so was
I, when he more gravely added:
</p>

<p>
<q>The other day we were talking
of the reverse of the medal,
as regards the good or bad qualities
of different people and nations.
And I think I can promise
you, <foreign rend='italic'>cara mia</foreign>, that as my respect
for you, and I hope my own good
sense, will always preserve me from
this ludicrous excess of a national
characteristic, so the only form
which it will take will be in making
me more observant that you
should receive from my hands
alone those little attentions, and
what the French call <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>petits soins</foreign>,<note place='foot'>Little cares.</note>
which are so necessary to a woman,
and which make up so large a
share in the lesser enjoyments of
her life. I hope never to bore
you. But I hope always to wait
upon you.</q>
</p>

<p>
I looked over my shoulder as we
came to this point in our discourse.
Frank and Elizabeth
were discussing their future also in
another part of the <foreign rend='italic'>loggia</foreign>. And I
thought to myself, if we could have
compared notes, we should no
doubt have traced many differences
characteristic of English and
Italian future husbands. But I am
convinced that both English maidens
were equally content with
their prospects.
</p>

<p>
We paid more than one visit to
the great museum of Naples, now
called the Museo Nazionale, but
which Mary and Frank remembered
as the Museo Borbonico.
Since they were last here, the dynasty
being changed, the name of
the collection and the arrangement
of the objects have also
changed. Mary, who is very decided
in her artistic preferences,
had her favorites here, as I have
always found she had in every collection
of pictures or statues she
had once visited; and faithful to
her old loves, she never could rest
or look at other objects till she
had revisited those that had already
struck her imagination. I
do not know whether it may arise
from the fact that in Rome the attention
is naturally more turned, in
the collections at the Vatican, to
those which have reference to the
life and customs of the early Christians,
in preference to the indications
of pagan life; but certainly
the objects in the museum at Naples
brought before me, with a
vividness I had never felt elsewhere,
the very minutest details of old
Roman existence. And I believe,
in point of fact, no collection equals
that at Naples, enriched as it is by
the treasure-trove of Pompeii and
Herculaneum. It would be quite
easy to furnish a house with every
requirement of life from roof to
kitchen out of the abundance of
these interesting relics of the long
ago past. And as I wandered
about the large chambers filled with
kitchen utensils, lamps, vases, and
female ornaments, and then passed
into the halls where are the frescos
that decorated the walls of their
dwellings, I felt I could realize to
myself the many differences in the
external forms of their life and our
own.
</p>

<p>
The first conclusion I arrive at
is that there was more sameness
and less multiplicity. For instance,
there was a certain received
form for lamps. You had your
choice, in the ornamental parts, of
the heads of lions or of griffins,
but the shape was the same. In
the kitchen the like shape reigned
as in the <foreign rend='italic'>triclinium</foreign> or the <foreign rend='italic'>œci</foreign>&mdash;the
dining-room and drawing-rooms
of the ancients&mdash;minus the
<pb n='817'/><anchor id='Pg817'/>
ornaments.<note place='foot'>There are some exceptions, such as the
beautiful candelabra of the Villa Diomed.</note> The same absence of diversity
is observable among the
jewels. There could be very little
difference, except in size and
weight, between one lady's necklace
and another's. The houses,
judging from the discoveries at
Pompeii, and borne out by the classic
writers, were all built on the
same model, some large and magnificent,
others small and mean,
but alike in structure. I pause,
and ask myself how life went on
without modern china in the houses
of the great. Though much of
their glass was beautiful, yet what
a difference between their earthenware
pots and our Sèvres and Dresden,
Worcester and Minton! Everywhere
the tables and seats and
chairs were alike. The difference
lay in the draperies and the cushions,
never in the shape. It sounds
bald and trite to register these remarks;
but if we carry out the
thought, and try and place ourselves
where the men and women of Rome
and its subject provinces stood,
and in imagination sleep in a <foreign rend='italic'>cubiculum</foreign><note place='foot'>Bed-chamber.</note>
six feet long and four wide,
sit on a marble representation of a
camp-stool, and lay our work or
our book&mdash;which latter will be in
the inconvenient shape of a long
roll of papyrus&mdash;on a round marble
table with three lion's paws for
legs; if we fancy our rooms divided
one from the other by <foreign rend='italic'>portières</foreign>, or
hangings, instead of doors, artistically
draped in longitudinal folds,
and fastened with cords by the
fashionable upholsterer of the day;
if to this we add an almost entire
absence of washing-basins, and, instead,
a lavishness in the article of
marble baths, all more or less taken
in public; if from vestibule and
<foreign rend='italic'>atrium</foreign>,<note place='foot'>Court.</note> from <foreign rend='italic'>hospitium</foreign><note place='foot'>Reception-room.</note> and <foreign rend='italic'>exedra</foreign>,<note place='foot'>Room for guests.</note>
we dismiss all notion of knicknacks,
all glass-fronted cabinets, all buhl
and <foreign rend='italic'>marqueterie</foreign>, all enamelled snuff-boxes,
china pug-dogs, and filigree;
with no Berlin-wool work and no
miniatures; a few severely beautiful
bronze figures, some busts, some
heathen goddesses in tinted marble,
standing cold and naked in a niche;
an ever-plashing fountain like the
pattering of incessant rain&mdash;if we
bring all this vividly before us, we
shall soon feel that the minute yet
all but infinite circumstances of external
life having been so different
from our own, the whole flow of
thought and fancy must have been
different.
</p>

<p>
We owe more than we are aware,
both for good and evil, to the way
we furnish our houses. And if we
decorate them according to our
own ideas, we must remember that
those decorations are for ever
throwing back our ideas upon ourselves
in a perpetual reflection
until a sort of moral identity is established.
</p>

<p>
My impression is that the greater
simplicity of form, combined, as
was the case with the ancients, with
a very high though but slightly varied
style of decorative art, may
have left a greater solidity, unity,
and intensity in the old-world
characters, as compared with what
we find in modern minds, distributed
amongst such an endless variety
of objects.
</p>

<p>
It is a great thing to be elevated
by noble desires and high Christian
aims above the trivialities of modern
life. But if those high aspirations
are absent, it is perhaps a
safeguard to take to old china, old
lace, and Louis Quinze furniture. It
breaks up the thoughts into a kaleidoscope
<pb n='818'/><anchor id='Pg818'/>
of fancies; and that, on the
whole, is decidedly preferable to
the restlessness of youth, health,
and idleness, leading to a craving for
gladiatorial fights and scenes of
bloodshed and cruelty. In those
days the virtuous were nobly virtuous,
and were very rare. The vicious
were horribly vicious, and
formed the generality. It always
struck me that an old Roman house
must have been a dull home. And
<foreign rend='italic'>ennui</foreign> is the mother of naughtiness
quite as surely as the devil is the
father of lies. There are minds
which cannot be great, as there are
lives which never are much more
than harmless. Surely for these
the multiplicities of modern times,
the toys of fashion, the novelties of
the day, in dress, furniture, and ornament,
are safety-valves and almost
godsends! At least they are better
than the arena, with its brutalizing
scenes of blood and horror,
where a vestal had but to turn her
thumb to take the life of the victim
bleeding before her eyes!
</p>

<p>
These results of modern civilization
are not Christianity; and I
am taking a very low standard in
all I am now saying. But they are
the dross of a civilization leavened
by Christianity, and they are very
different from the poison that
found its way into the daily life of
Roman men and women from the
seething wickedness of the great
heathen empire.
</p>

<p>
Nothing can exceed the interest
of the paintings taken from
Pompeii. Of course I was intimately
acquainted with them from
engravings, and had been all my
life. One of the early impressions
of my childhood was the delight
of finding that the grave old Romans
(and therefore the Greeks before
them), for whom I had a very
pagan admiration, were capable of
appreciating humor as expressed
in the movements and attitudes of
animals. I was overjoyed at this
touch of sympathy with a dead
past; and I recommend all visitors
to Naples to look out for certain
cocks and hens and other
creatures among the lesser mural
decorations taken from Pompeii.
The well-known dancing girls I
had never properly admired until
I saw them being copied by a
Neapolitan artist in the Museum.
He had not deviated one hair's
breadth from the original outline;
but the mere restoration of vivid
coloring had imparted to them an
airy, floating grace which I had
failed fully to detect in the scratched
and faded originals, but which
I at once felt must have belonged
to them when they decorated some
rich Pompeian's house.
</p>

<p>
While I was wandering about,
trying to live for an hour the inner
homespun life of a Roman maiden
by gazing long on the walls she
must have looked on, Mary had
gone in search of the Farnese
Bull and the exquisite half-head
and figure of the Psyche,
that wonderful embodiment of virginal
grace and feminine delicacy
which makes one long to have seen
the statue in its unmutilated condition.
She had stood for a good
quarter of an hour before the
Aristides (for we insist on believing
it is Aristides), and was, as she
told me afterwards, growing more
and more in the consoling belief
that many of the old pagans will
have found a place among the
thrones of the blest through the
mercy of Him who never asks for
more than he has given, and who
since the creation has never left
the world without a witness of himself.
Then she visited the Farnese
Flora, that wonderful triumph of
<pb n='819'/><anchor id='Pg819'/>
art over matter, where in a statue
of above twelve feet such floating
grace is expressed that she seems
to be skimming along the ground,
while the light wind plays in the
drapery.
</p>

<p>
I found Mary lost in thought before
a beautiful bronze statue of
Mercury in repose. The lithe figure
has just sat down to rest on the
edge of a rock. The tension of
the muscles is gradually relaxing.
One foot as yet only touches the
ground with the heel. Wait a
moment, and the foot will yield
and rest. Never was fatigue gradually
giving way to repose more
exquisitely depicted. Then Mary
turned to the dead Amazon with the
death-wound beneath her breast,
and finally declared that having
satisfied herself by revisiting these,
that for one reason or another had
haunted her for twenty years, she
was ready to admire the others.
It is curious how the long lines of
statues and busts seem to give out
cold. The same stone walls covered
with pictures could never be so
severely cold. The old gods and
heroes seem to breathe upon you
with an icy breath from out of the
grave of the old classic world.
</p>

<p>
The best pictures in the Naples
Museum are not very numerous, but
are admirable specimens of the Italian
schools. They are collected into
one or two rooms, deserving time
and study. A cursory view of the
others will be sufficient to satisfy
most people. There is much more
to be seen besides the relics from
Pompeii and Herculaneum, the
statues and pictures. It is all
worth visiting, and, to be fully appreciated,
requires many hours to
be spent on each different class of
objects.
</p>

<p>
I had a very distinct and not altogether
a pleasant recollection of
the mysterious grotto of Pozzuoli,
which had haunted my imagination
ever since I was here as a child.
Ida and I had made an engagement
to visit Astroni, Victor Emanuel's
happy hunting-grounds, one day
when we were to have the carriage
to ourselves; and accordingly we
were to pass through the grotto.
You approach it by a deep cutting
in the rock, the sides of which
are draped with ivy and hanging
plants, with bright tufts of wild
flowers wherever a few grains of
earth give them a roothold. There
is a small oratory to the right as
you enter, of a most simple and
rustic kind, and kept by a Capuchin,
whom I cannot call a venerable
hermit, as he happened to be of
rather youthful appearance. On
<foreign rend='italic'>festas</foreign> his little altar was covered
with flowers, and a few votive candles
burnt before the obscure picture
of the Madonna within the
dark recesses of the cave. When
the poor Capuchin heard a carriage
approaching, he would hurry forth
with a little tin box, which he held
up to us for an alms. We seldom
failed to give him some, and from
time to time it would be silver instead
of the more frequent copper;
and then his gratitude became eloquent,
and many a blessing followed
us down the murky gloom of
the long, unsavory grotto. Certainly,
this strange road, which it appears
dates from the middle of the
first Christian century, is not calculated
to leave a pleasant impression,
though in many ways it presents
picturesque bits which reminded
me of some of Salvator Rosa's pictures.
It would be quite dark but
for the yellow, faint light of gas-lamps,
not sufficient in number to
dispel the gloom, which is greatly
increased by the clouds of dust the
numerous carts, carriages, and herds
<pb n='820'/><anchor id='Pg820'/>
of goats are constantly raising, the
latter adding thereto their own peculiarly
suffocating odor. It is paved
in the same way as the Neapolitan
streets, and the noise reverberates
from the roof. It has a curious effect
when you lean forward to see the
bearded goats just visible through
the dusty air, and further on, perhaps,
a cabriolet laden with people&mdash;six
inside, four out, and one boy at least,
after the Neapolitan fashion, hanging
in a net beneath the vehicle&mdash;drawn
by one horse, always equal
to his load, no matter how starved
and miserable he may be. On it
comes, the merry inmates singing,
shouting, piercing the darkness,
but compelled thereby to slacken
their pace a little, lest there should
be a collision in this Erebus. We
were always silent and a little uncomfortable
in the din, the dust,
and the darkness. Yet it had to
be passed through again and again,
as being the only road out into the
country, unless we went all round
by the Strada Nuova and Nisida.
At the entrance of the grotto from
Naples is the supposed tomb of
Virgil, hidden beneath ivy and
acanthus leaves-just as a poet
would have wished! We came out
from the grotto on the busy, picturesque
village of Fiorigrotta,
where the whole population seem
to live out in the one long street.
Astroni is an extinct volcanic crater,
the sides of which are clothed with
ilex and other trees. It is circular,
and a wall runs along the upper
rim to prevent the escape of the
deer and wild boar that are kept
there for the king's pleasure. There
are two carriage-roads through the
dense forest. At the bottom of
the basin there are a few open
spaces, marshy land, and water.
The solitude and silence are intense;
for, as usual in Italy, there
are not many singing birds, and
what there are do not give song
during the heat of the day any
more than in our northern climes.
I never shall forget the silence that
reigned, nor the feeling of solitude
induced by peering through the
trees, looking down on the small
lakes of intensely blue water below,
and knowing that in those dense
thickets myriads of wild animals
were hiding in their lair, while we
were the only human beings. The
gates are kept locked, and it requires
a special order to penetrate
this sylvan scene. It does
not seem to me a very satisfactory
way of sporting. You are too sure
of your game, walled in as it is all
round. After visiting the extinct
crater, we saw the emptied lake
of Agnano, once notorious for malaria,
now drained off and leaving
a wide plain more or less adapted
for agriculture. At present it
seems in a rather neglected state,
of which nature has taken advantage
to cast her unsolicited gifts
of flaunting bright wild flowers
broadcast over the whole space.
</p>

<p>
One of our most interesting excursions
was to the Solfatara, not
far from the Lago Agnano. This
also is an extinct crater; and
yet so barely extinct that we
feel, as we tread the sulphur-checkered
soil, and hear the hollow reverberation
if we stamp on the
ground, as if at any moment it
might again burst forth.
</p>

<p>
From time to time our nostrils
were disagreeably met by a puff of
steam redolent of sulphur; and occasionally
these puffs grow stronger
and more threatening. The stones
you pick up are tinged with yellow.
The vegetation is sparse and dwarfed.
At the further end of the plain
is a cave, from whence at regular
intervals rush clouds of hot steam,
<pb n='821'/><anchor id='Pg821'/>
while a roaring, boiling sound surges
within. The aperture is large
enough for a person to enter by
stooping a little. Most of our party
peeped in, but instantly retired
from the suffocating and horrible
stench and great heat.
</p>

<p>
The rocks are covered with sulphur
and alum; and in my eagerness
that we should all equally
benefit by the sight, I wanted to
persuade Ida just to take one peep.
It would, however, have been a risk
to do anything which even for a
second might embarrass the action
of her delicate lungs and weak
heart. She tried to approach, but
turned back with the feeling that
one puff more would have suffocated
her.
</p>

<p>
I think we all felt as if we were
standing in one of the outer halls
of a region never to be mentioned
<q>to ears polite,</q> and almost too
<q>Dantesque</q> to be pleasant. We
gladly breathed a purer atmosphere
as we passed out of the
gate (inside which is a fabric of
sulphur-works), and bent our steps
between white walls on which the
green lizards basked, and between
fields of unripe corn and mulberry-trees,
till we reached an open
space commanding a fine view of
the Gulf of Pozzuoli and the hills beyond.
From thence we turned into
the Capuchin church dedicated to S.
Januarius, and said to be built over
the spot where he suffered martyrdom
in 305. There is a stone, on
which he is believed to have been
beheaded, let into the wall, and
protected with an iron grating. It
is seamed with red marks as of
blood. It is very probably a stone
on which he knelt and on which the
blood fell. But a block, whether
of stone or wood, for the purposes
of beheading, is a modern invention.
The Romans used a sword&mdash;as
the Turks use a scymitar for that
ghastly purpose to this day&mdash;and
the patient knelt upright.
</p>

<p>
It was pleasant to rest in the cool
church, which, humble as it is, is
not without its quota of beautiful
marbles, and is kept exquisitely
clean, with fresh flowers on the
altar, and all care taken of it as
if the community were still there.
We found only a lay brother left
in charge. I think he said he had
a companion. All the poor fathers
were dispersed by Victor Emanuel's
government, and Mass is only said
on feast-days; though it seemed to
be the only church in that immediate
neighborhood, and the poor of
the district must greatly miss the
presence of the Capuchin fathers,
those special friends of the poor.
</p>

<p>
As we came down the hill, we
were met by peasant lads, who
wanted us to buy lumps of sulphur
and the skeletons of the pretty
little fish called the sea-horse,
which abound in this part of the
Mediterranean, and which are just
like the knights among chessmen.
They may be seen alive in quantities
in the aquarium at Brighton.
They twist the tapering end of their
tails round a fragment of sea-weed,
or indeed, as the buoyancy of the
water keeps them up, they need
but to touch something stationary.
And there they stand in groups,
motionless, and looking for all the
world like a grave assembly of
horses' heads of the most delicate
race, and with noses slightly turned
up. Nothing can be more graceful
than the way they hold themselves.
Their heads are not bigger than
those of ordinary-sized chessmen.
</p>

<p>
As the Vernons had been at
Posilippo all through the eruption
of Mount Vesuvius in April, 1872,
they were naturally anxious we
should see something of the devastation
<pb n='822'/><anchor id='Pg822'/>
it had occasioned. We determined,
therefore, to drive to San
Sebastiano, a village which was almost
entirely destroyed. As we
approached the spot, it seemed as
if we were driving into the kingdom
of chaos, where <q>the earth was
void and empty.</q> On either side
lay wide plains of gray-black lava,
looking as if a dead, unfertile earth
had been furrowed with the burning
shares of some gigantic and
infernal plough, and had remained
calcined and sterile for ever after.
We left the carriage and climbed
up a large mound of lava. I found
myself nearly on a level with the
low roof of the small church, round
which the lava had crept, but had
spared it. I looked down into the
basement of a house below me.
The lava had poured in and filled
what once were rooms, but had
left the walls and the roof standing.
There was part of a street left, the
lava having, with seeming caprice,
turned off to the left, as it poured
down the mountain, just in that
spot. Our friends told us that as
they used to sit by the hour and
watch the progress of the burning
stream through glasses, they could
see the small white houses, with the
fiery flood approaching, when suddenly
each house seemed to leap
into the air like a lighted straw,
and then was seen no more. A cat
ran past me, in haste to save her
paws. We could not stand still
long, for, though more than a year
had elapsed, the land was still too
hot to be pleasant; and when we
reached home, we found our feet
were blistered. The poor creatures
whose homes have thus perished
approach you timidly with bits of
lava to sell. They still have a
scared look in their faces. But
nothing will persuade them to shift
their quarters and leave their grand
but dangerous neighbor. They are
trying to rebuild their village, and
are deaf to all the remonstrances
of the great scientific philosopher<note place='foot'>Signor Palmier.</note>
who lives a hermit's life in the observatory
half-way up the mountain.
He has a Capuchin priest as a companion;
and the latter was able to
give the last rites of the church to
about forty of the unfortunate people,
who, actuated by curiosity, had
attempted to climb the mountain
during the eruption. It seems they
had never calculated upon the effect
of the burning heat from a distance.
They thought if there were a certain
space between them and the
lava, they should be safe. They
forgot that actual contact was not
needed; and they were scorched to
death long before the stream reached
the spot where they stood. Not
one of those thus licked up by the
breath of the volcano ever recovered,
or even lived long enough to
quit the place.
</p>

<p>
Signor Palmier and the Capuchin
saw a carriage full of people,
coachman and two horses, advancing
up the mountain. Suddenly
the whole was submerged. They
could only tell where it had been
arrested by the carrion birds hovering
over a certain spot for many
days after!

<div>
<head>VIII. Laws Of Nature And Miracles.</head>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> We differ very widely
in many points, sir; but there is
one point about which we shall have
no difficulty in agreeing&mdash;the immutability
of natural laws. In fact,
you have already conceded that
the laws of nature are unchangeable.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Yes, I admit the unchangeability
of the laws of nature;
but I most strongly protest against
your rash inference that therefore
miracles are impossible.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Yet my reasoning is
very plain. <q>The law of nature,
observes Moleschott, is a stringent
expression of necessity. There exists
in it neither exception nor limitation;
and no imaginable power
can disregard this necessity. A
stone not supported will in all eternity
fall towards the centre of the
earth; and there never was, and
never will be, a command for the
sun to stand still</q> (p. 33).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Is this what you call
<q>reasoning</q>?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Yes. <q>The experience
of thousands of years has impressed
upon the investigator the
firmest conviction of the immutability
of the laws of nature, so that
there cannot remain the least doubt
in respect to this great truth</q> (p.
34).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> This I grant.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>Science has gradually
taken all the positions of the childish
belief of the peoples; it has snatched
thunder and lightning from the
hands of the gods ...</q> (<hi rend='italic'>ibid.</hi>)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> It was Christianity, not
science, that conquered the gods.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>The eclipse of the
stars and the stupendous powers
of the Titans of the olden times
have been grasped by the fingers of
man</q> (<hi rend='italic'>ibid.</hi>)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> How can the <hi rend='italic'>fingers</hi> of
man grasp the eclipses and the
Titans?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>That which appeared
inexplicably miraculous, and the
work of a supernatural power, has,
by the torch of science, proved to
be the effect of hitherto unknown
natural forces</q> (<hi rend='italic'>ibid.</hi>)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> You dream, doctor.
Has <q>the torch of science</q> made
known those hitherto unknown
forces? No scientific work has yet
explained how, by an act of the
will, water can be changed into
wine, how the deaf and dumb can
be instantaneously cured, how the
blind can be made to see, the paralytic
to walk, and the dead to rise,
at the sound of a voice, four days
after burial, and when already in
a state of advanced putrefaction.
You may of course deny these facts,
as you deny that the sun ever received
a command to stand still;
but to say that <q>the torch of science</q>
has shown these facts to be
the effect of unknown natural forces
is to tell us the most stupid lie that
can be uttered. Lies, you know,
should at least be credible.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>We have the fullest
right, and are scientifically correct,
in asserting that there is no such
thing as a miracle. Everything that
happens does so in a natural way&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>,
<pb n='824'/><anchor id='Pg824'/>
in a mode determined only by
accidental or necessary coalition
of existing materials and their immanent
natural forces. No revolution
on earth or in heaven, however
stupendous, could occur in any
other manner</q> (p. 34).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> These are mere words.
I deny that science gives you the
least right to suppress miracles.
How can you establish such a
right?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>Wherever fire and
water meet, vapors must arise
and exert their irresistible power.
Where the seed falls in the ground,
there it will grow; where the thunderbolt
is attracted, there it will
strike. Can there exist any doubt
as to these truths?</q> (p. 35).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Please, doctor, come to
the point.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>How is it possible
that the unalterable order in which
things move should ever be disturbed
without producing an irremediable
gap in the world, without delivering
us and everything up to
arbitrary power, without reducing
all science, every earthly endeavor,
to a vain and childish effort?</q>
(p. 36).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> All this rhetoric is most
absurd, doctor. <q>The order in
which things move</q> is not unalterable;
and He whom you call an
<q>arbitrary power</q> can alter it when
he pleases without asking your permission,
or without reducing science
to a childish effort.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> What? You contradict
yourself, sir. For, if the order
in which things move is changeable,
the laws of nature cannot be unchangeable.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Not at all. You sophistically
confound two things entirely
different&mdash;the <hi rend='italic'>law</hi> of nature, and
the <hi rend='italic'>course</hi> of nature. The first is
unchangeable, because it is connected
with the essence of things;
but the second is changeable, as a
constant and universal experience
compels us to admit. However
much you may hate <q>arbitrary
power,</q> you cannot deny that, besides
necessary causes, there are
others which are free in their exertions.
Can you deny, for instance,
that a stone may be thrown upwards
in spite of gravitation, or that we
can catch hold of the stone from the
window, and, in spite of gravitation,
we can prevent it from falling back
to the ground? Now, if we do this,
we do not change the <hi rend='italic'>law</hi> of nature,
and nevertheless we modify the
<hi rend='italic'>course</hi> of nature by freely producing
a phenomenon which nature would
not produce.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Would you call this a
miracle?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> The question is impertinent.
I call it a change in the
course of nature. Now, if the
course of nature can be modified
without the law of nature being altered,
it is absurd to pretend that
there is contradiction in holding
the unchangeableness of the latter
and the changeableness of the former.
This being evident, let us go
a step further, and draw an obvious
conclusion. We can, when we
please, catch the stone from the
window, and prevent it from falling;
and cannot God do the same? We
are free to exert our power; but is
not God free, or has he less power
than we have? If you are honest,
you will own that what can be done
by us can be done by our Creator
and Lord. Now, if he stops the
stone in the air, a miracle will be
wrought, and no law of nature violated.
You cannot deny the possibility
of miracles without denying
God.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>A spirit independent
of nature cannot exist; for never
<pb n='825'/><anchor id='Pg825'/>
has an unprejudiced mind cultivated
by science perceived its manifestation</q>
(p. 36).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Are you not ashamed,
doctor, to repeat such a nonsensical
assertion? You have already
failed to prove it, and I have shown
its absurdity in a preceding discussion.
Must I answer it anew? The
only answer you now deserve is
that <q>The fool has said in his heart,
<q>There is no God.</q></q> Fools, in fact,
deny God in their hearts, but cannot
deny him in their minds, because
atheism is not the result of
intellectual knowledge, but of moral
depravity. Our present question,
however, is not theism or atheism,
but the possibility of miracles
without any breach of natural laws.
Surely, if there were no God, no
miracle would be possible; but your
argument was that if the laws of
nature are unchangeable, no miracle
is possible; and this I have shown
to be false. If there is a God, as we
must now assume, miracles are possible.
In the same manner, if a
single true miracle has ever been
wrought, there is a God.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>Apparent exceptions
from the natural order have been
called <hi rend='italic'>miracles</hi>, of which there have
been many at all times</q> (p. 36).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> You should know better,
doctor. The church is not satisfied
with <q>apparent</q> exceptions
from the natural order; the exception
must be rigorously proved.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>We should only
waste words in our endeavor to
prove the natural impossibility of
a miracle. No educated, much less a
scientific, person who is convinced
of the immutable order of things
can nowadays believe in miracles.
We find it rather wonderful that so
clear and acute a thinker as Ludwig
Feuerbach should have expended
so much logic in refuting
the Christian miracles. What founder
of religion did not deem it necessary,
in order to introduce himself
to the world, to perform miracles?
And has not his success
proved that he was right? What
prophet, what saint, is there who has
not performed miracles? The miracle-seeker
sees them daily and
hourly. Do not the table-spirits
belong to the order of miracles?
All such miracles are equal in the
eye of science; they are the result
of a diseased fancy</q> (pp. 36, 37).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> This is miserable logic,
doctor. Why do you speak of the
<hi rend='italic'>natural</hi> impossibility of miracles?
Have we ever taught that miracles
are <hi rend='italic'>naturally</hi> possible? We know
that nature works no miracles, and
that all miracles are supernatural.
It is therefore either a mean trick
or a logical blunder on your part
to pretend that the <hi rend='italic'>natural</hi> possibility
of miracles is the point in
question. That no educated or
scientific man can nowadays believe
in miracles is not only an
empty boast, but also a disgraceful
calumny. We Christians believe in
miracles, and yet, I venture to say,
we need not resort to you for lessons
in science or education. As
a reason for not believing in miracles,
you allege <q>the immutable
order of things</q>; that is, you assume
what is to be proved. The
order of things is so far from being
immutable that we see it modified
at every moment. It is the laws of
nature, not the order of things, that
are immutable. That Feuerbach
<q>expended so much of logic in refuting
Christian miracles</q> I will
not deny; I only say that his logic,
like your own, is mere sophism and
cavil. Of course you call him <q>so
clear and acute a thinker</q>; but
we know what this means on the
lips of Freemasons. If he was <q>so
<pb n='826'/><anchor id='Pg826'/>
clear and acute a thinker,</q> why did
he not furnish you with at least one
good argument against Christian miracles?
</p>

<p>
Besides, you pretend that all
founders of religion deemed it necessary
to perform miracles. What
then? Were it true, the fact would
scarcely help your cause; for it
would only prove that there have
ever been impostors, as there have
been quacks and coin-forgers.
Now, who would think of selling
counterfeited articles, if there had
existed none genuine? Would
there be quacks, had there been no
doctors? And yet your reasoning
leads to the conclusion that, because
there are so many quacks,
there can be no doctors. Are you,
then, a mere quack yourself?
</p>

<p>
You say with a malicious sneer
that all prophets and saints performed
miracles. Yes; they performed
miracles, or rather, to speak
more correctly, God wrought miracles
through them. Yet, in the
teeth of sacred and ecclesiastical
history which testifies to an infinite
number of unquestionable miracles,
you are shameless enough to conclude
that no miracle has ever been
performed, on the plea that miracle-seekers,
table-spirits, and diseased
fancy must have conspired to
deceive the world. Is it necessary
to refute such a silly assertion?
Was Elymas the magician a miracle-seeker
when S. Paul, to punish
him for his opposition to Christianity,
struck him blind with a word
in the presence of the Roman centurion?
Was it a trick of table-spirits
that made the blind see, the
lame walk, or the dumb speak?
Was it diseased fancy that impressed
on an immense crowd the belief
that they had been miraculously
fed by Christ in the desert, where
no provisions were at hand? No,
doctor, you are not silly enough to
believe anything of the sort.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> But what do you answer
to the following difficulties?
First, if we admit miracles, <q>science
will be reduced to a vain and
childish effort</q> (p. 36). Secondly,
how can we conceive <q>a supreme
legislator who allows himself to be
moved by prayers and sobs to reverse
the immutable order which
he himself has created, to violate
his own laws, and with his own
hand to destroy the action of natural
forces?</q> (p. 38). Thirdly,
<q>every miracle, if it existed, says
Cotta, would lead to the conviction
that the creation is not deserving
the respect which all pay to it, and
the mystics would necessarily be
obliged to deduce from the imperfection
of the created world the imperfection
of the Creator</q> (p. 38).
Fourthly, <q>is it a view worthy of
God to represent him as a power
which now and then gives a new
impulse to the world in its course,
and puts on a screw, etc., like the
regulator of a watch? If the world
has been created by God perfect,
how can it require any repairs?</q>
(p. 39). Fifthly, we see that nature
works without superior control;
<q>its action is frequently quite independent
of the rules of a higher
reason, now constructing, now destroying,
now full of design, then
again perfectly blind and in contradiction
with all moral and rational
laws. That in the formation of organic
and inorganic bodies, which
are constantly being renewed, there
can be no direct governing reason
at work is proved by the most
striking facts. The <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>nisus formativus</foreign>
inherent in nature is so blind
and so dependent on external circumstances
that the most senseless
forms are frequently engendered,
that it is often incapable of obviating
<pb n='827'/><anchor id='Pg827'/>
or overcoming the slightest obstructions,
and that frequently the
contrary of what according to reason
should happen is effected</q> (pp.
41, 42). These are serious difficulties,
sir.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I hardly think them to
be serious, doctor. The first entirely
disappears when you reflect
that the conclusions of physical
science are <hi rend='italic'>all hypothetic</hi>, inasmuch
as they regard phenomena which
must take place under the action
of given powers, to the exclusion
of any other power extraneous to
those taken into account. Such
conclusions, therefore, imply the
condition that no extraneous agent
and no disturbing cause interferes
with the production of the phenomena.
If an extraneous power interferes,
the conditions are changed,
and with them the phenomena;
but science is not upset. A stone
not supported must fall. <hi rend='italic'>Not supported</hi>;
such is the condition.
Now, whether you, or I, or the roof,
or God, or an angel support it, the
consequence will be that the stone
will not fall. Now, I ask you, is
science <q>reduced to a vain and
childish effort</q> because you or I
or the roof prevent the stone from
falling? I presume, doctor, that if
such were the case, science would
long since have disappeared from
this world. Why, then, should science
become a vain and childish
effort as soon as God would do
himself what we can freely do without
destroying science? Take another
example. Nature builds no
stately palaces, no fine steamers, no
locomotives, no railroads. All such
things are our free creations. Yet
surely you will not maintain that
by building palaces or by boring
mountains we destroy science, although
we may interfere very materially
with the works of nature.
</p>

<p>
Now, if our free action upon nature
does not destroy science, why
should God's free action destroy
it? Answer me in the name of
reason: What theory of natural
science would be falsified were
God to send angels to build you a
palace, or devils to dig you a
grave?
</p>

<p>
And now I come to your second
difficulty. You assume that the
supreme legislator cannot work a
miracle without destroying the action
of natural forces and violating
his own laws, thus reversing the
immutable order which he himself
has created. But you are mistaken.
The order of things is not immutable;
this I have already shown. On
the other hand, we have just seen
that no law of nature is ever violated
by a miracle. Lastly, God's
action does not destroy the action
of natural forces, but produces an
effect superior to and independent
of them. Nor is this strange; for
we ourselves can do the like within
the range of our limited powers.
When we go up-stairs, do we destroy
the action of gravity that urges
us downwards? By no means.
The action of gravity continues its
work, but our contrary exertion
prevails; and thus our body obeys
the resultant of the two opposite
actions, both of which obtain their
effect. You see, therefore, that
there is no need of destroying the
action of natural forces in order to
produce an effect which natural
forces cannot produce. After these
remarks, nothing remains of your
second difficulty but <q>the prayers
and sobs</q> which you cruelly ridicule
as useless and superstitious.
But our Father who is in heaven
listens to such prayers and is moved
by those sobs. This is abundantly
proved by innumerable authentic
facts; and this suffices for us.
</p>

<pb n='828'/><anchor id='Pg828'/>

<p>
Your third difficulty is based on
Cotta's notion that the creation deserves
respect on account of its
perfection. Cotta may be one of
your great men, but surely he does
not know what he is speaking about.
What <q>respect</q> do we owe to creation?
Benighted barbarians thought,
indeed, that the sun, the earth, and
the stars deserved respect; but how
can a man who pretends to be a
philosopher, and who professes
himself an enemy of superstition,
adopt such a stale pagan view, unless
he blinds himself and renounces
reason by bestowing upon matter
the worship which he refuses to
the living God? To say that the
world is <q>perfect</q> is a mere equivocation.
The world is perfect
after its own manner, inasmuch as
it serves all the purposes for which
it has been made; it is perfect in
the same sense in which we say
that a thermometer, a telescope, or
an engine is perfect; it is a perfect
instrument in God's hand for the
attainment of a determinate end;
and therefore its perfection is <hi rend='italic'>relative</hi>
only, and might be greater and
greater without end. Now, Cotta's
argument overlooks this obvious
restriction, and presents the world
as <hi rend='italic'>absolutely</hi> perfect. If the world
is imperfect, says he, God is imperfect;
but miracles would show that
the world is imperfect; and therefore
miracles would show that God
is imperfect. Now, is not this,
doctor, asinine logic? We might
as well argue thus: If an engine is
imperfect, its maker is imperfect;
but the opening of a turning-cock
for admitting more steam shows
that the engine is imperfect; and
therefore that opening shows that
the engine-maker is imperfect. And
this leads me to your fourth difficulty,
which is nothing but a repetition
of the third.
</p>

<p>
You ask: <q>Is it a view worthy
of God to represent him as a power
which now and then gives a new
impulse to the world in its course?</q>
I answer, <hi rend='italic'>Yes</hi>; it is quite worthy of
God to exercise his power in the
world in the way he thinks fit.
Shall we say, then, that God, <q>like
the regulator of a watch, puts a
screw on the world</q>? Why not?
The watchmaker is not degraded
by regulating his work. But, then,
<q>the world requires repairs</q>? I
say, <hi rend='italic'>Yes</hi>. And if you conclude that
the world <q>has not been created
perfect,</q> I reply that although it
came out relatively perfect from the
hands of the Creator, it has gradually
and most sadly deteriorated
by the malice of man. Moreover,
the world, whether more or less
perfect in itself, without a constant
active intervention of its Creator
can neither work nor last for a moment.
The world is, therefore,
constantly <q>repaired,</q> to use your
expression, and has <q>screws put on
it,</q> as history testifies; and other
<q>screws</q> are undoubtedly ready
for further <q>repairs</q> when they
will be wanted.
</p>

<p>
Your last difficulty arises from
your assumption that nature works
without being controlled by a superior
power. But how do you know
that nature is not controlled? What
are the <q>striking facts</q> which
prove that <q>there is no direct governing
reason at work</q> in the formation
of organic and inorganic
bodies? Your <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>nisus formativus</foreign>
proves nothing. You say that the
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>nisus</foreign> is <q>blind.</q> You may well
call it blind, inasmuch as it is a
work of secondary causes; but you
cannot deny that it is ruled by a
superior reason. What does it
matter if <q>most senseless forms
are frequently engendered</q>? You
yourself admit that the <foreign rend='italic'>nisus formativus</foreign>
<pb n='829'/><anchor id='Pg829'/>
depends very much <q>on
external circumstances,</q> which may
mar or spoil the work of organization,
and which nothing obliges the
superior reason to alter or improve.
On the other hand, such senseless
forms are not so <q>frequently</q> engendered
as you pretend; and if a
few such senseless or monstrous
forms can move you to doubt
whether their formation is controlled
by a superior reason, I do not see
why the immensely greater number
of other forms perfectly constituted
should not constrain you to banish
the doubt, and to recognize that
matter not controlled and not directed
by reason cannot co-ordinate
its efforts towards the formation of
an organism of which it knows
neither the plan nor the object.
</p>

<p>
I trust, doctor, that these remarks
suffice to solve your difficulties,
and to show that the world is
governed by a superior reason.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> It may be; yet <q>what
this or that man may understand
by a governing reason, an absolute
power, a universal soul, a personal
God, etc., is his own affair. The
theologians, with their articles of
faith, must be left to themselves;
so the naturalists with their science.
They both proceed by different
routes</q> (p. 43).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> This is no reply, doctor,
and your remark is misplaced.
The existence of a personal God,
the possibility of miracles, and
many other such truths, are proved
by natural reason. Had I refuted
your objections by quoting <q>theologians</q>
and <q>articles of faith,</q>
your reply might have some meaning.
But since your allegations
have been answered by reason,
what does it avail to say that
<q>theologians, with their articles of
faith, must be left to themselves</q>?
Moreover, you unwittingly condemn
your own tactics. For if
theologians are to be left to themselves,
why do you, then, who are
no theologian, and not even a philosopher,
invade the province of
theology, and fight against faith?
</p>

<p>
If you have any desire to know
the truth about the reality of miracles,
I will tell you what you have
to do. M. Artus, a Frenchman,
on the 23d of July, 1871, publicly
challenged all the free-thinkers
of the world to show the falsity of
any two out of the many miracles
registered in M. Lasserre's book
entitled <hi rend='italic'>Notre Dame de Lourdes</hi>,
and staked 10,000 francs upon the
issue of the contest. This money
was safely deposited by him in the
hands of a notary-public in Paris;
and fifty judges were appointed,
some of whom were members of the
French Institute, and others fellows
of other celebrated institutions and
academies, or members of the bar,
including even a Protestant; so
that there could be no suspicion
of fanaticism, ultramontanism, or
mysticism about them. Now, incredible
as it may appear to you,
none of your great braggarts has
dared from that day till now to accept
the challenge. It is for you,
who are so peremptory in denouncing
miracles, to come forward, and
to blot out by an act of philosophical
valor the stain which the cowardice
of your enlightened friends
has left on the glory of free-thinkerism.
It is for you, I repeat; for
if a man of your standing and reputation
quails before the challenge,
the world will most reasonably conclude
that you have no faith whatever
in your own doctrines.

<div>
<head>IX. The Heavens.</head>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> The laws of nature are
<pb n='830'/><anchor id='Pg830'/>
universal. Such is the subject of
the seventh chapter of your <hi rend='italic'>Force
and Matter</hi>. I need hardly say
that, while admitting with you the
universality of the natural laws, I
cannot but condemn the materialistic
spirit which disgraces your explanation
of that obvious truth.
But in the chapter which follows
you speak of the heavens in a most
objectionable style.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>Every school-boy
knows that the sky is not a glass
shade covering the earth, but that,
in contemplating it, we behold an
immense space interrupted by infinitely
distant and scattered groups
of worlds</q> (p. 51).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> This I grant; but I am
at a loss to understand how the
contemplation of the heavens can
furnish you an argument against
the existence of God. Is it not
strange that what has hitherto been
considered to proclaim most loudly
the existence, and magnify the
power, of God, has become, in your
hands, an evidence in support of
atheism?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> The heavenly masses
<q>are in constant motion&mdash;a motion
singularly combined and complicated,
yet in all its modifications
merely the result of a single universal
law of nature&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>the law of attraction</hi>....
All these motions may be
determined and predicted with mathematical
exactness. As far as the
telescope of man reaches, the same
law, the same mechanical arrangement,
according to the same calculated
mechanical formula, is found.
Nowhere is there a trace of an arbitrary
finger which has ordered
the heavens or pointed out the
path of comets. <q>I have searched
the heavens,</q> says Lalande, <q>but
have nowhere found the traces of
God.</q> And when the Emperor
Napoleon asked the celebrated astronomer
Laplace why there was
no mention of God in his <hi rend='italic'>Mécanique
Céleste</hi>, he replied, <q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Sire, je
n'avais pas besoin de cette hypothèse</foreign>.</q>
The more astronomy progressed in
its knowledge of the laws and motions
in the heavens, the more it
repudiated the idea of a supernatural
influence, and the easier it
became to deduce the origin, grouping,
and motions of the heavenly
bodies from the properties inherent
in matter itself. The attraction
of atoms rendered the bodies
compact, whilst the law of attraction,
in combination with their
primary motion, produced the mode
of their reciprocal rotation which
we now observe</q> (pp. 51, 52).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Waiving the more than
problematic plausibility of your
premises, and setting aside the
blasphemies which you have diligently
copied from the books of
the French unbelievers, and which
are too stolid to need an answer, I
reply, doctor, that you are always
too hasty in drawing your conclusions.
Why did you not reflect
that the matter of which the celestial
bodies are formed must have
had an origin, that the revolutions
of those bodies cannot be ruled by
an abstract law, and that their
enormous distances, as well as the
expanse of their orbits through the
immensity of space, compel the admission
of an infinite being ranging
infinitely above matter and necessarily
prior to it? You should not
have overlooked the fact that the
heavens proclaim God's existence
by their immensity far more eloquently
than by the revolutions of
the celestial bodies. You speak of
movements ruled by a law. I admit
the movements and the law
which rules our calculation of the
movements. But without space
there is no movement, and without
<pb n='831'/><anchor id='Pg831'/>
God there is no space; therefore
without God there is no movement.
Extricate yourself, if you can. Do
you concede that without space
there is no movement?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> It is evident.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Do you admit that
without God there is no space?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> This I deny.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Then what do you
mean by <q>space</q>?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> I fancy that space is
nothing but the volume of bodies.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> How is this possible?
A body moves through space.
Now, does a body move through
its own volume, or does it move
through the volume of other bodies?
On the contrary, the body
cannot move without pushing away
before it all other bodies and volumes
whatever from the space they
occupy. It is therefore evident
that space, as such, is not the volume
of bodies.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Then I shall say that
space is the capability of bodies
and motion.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> This definition of space
may be admitted if properly understood.
But what is such a capability?
Is it, in your opinion, a
real and positive entity?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> I should not think so,
unless, indeed, it be occupied by
bodies.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I know that many are
of this opinion, that the reality of
space depends on the presence of
bodies; but I say that, if such were
the case, then empty space would
be mere nothing. Now, if you admit
this, you will be compelled to
admit also the absurdity that a
mere nothing can be greater or
smaller. For between two neighboring
atoms there may be a greater
or smaller interval of space;
and such an interval, by the hypothesis,
would be nothing. Hence
it is evident that space, no matter
whether occupied or unoccupied,
must be something real.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Then I say that space
is a mere relation of material objects.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> There are relations of
bodies in space; but all such relations
<hi rend='italic'>presuppose</hi> the existence of
absolute space, and therefore space
itself is none of those relations.
Moreover, since all real relations
have their reason in something
real, which is the foundation of the
relativity, it follows that space, as
that through which one body is
really related to another, is in itself
a reality, independently of the
relations which may result from
the existence of bodies in it. And
again, before bodies can be considered
as related through space, they
must be each located in space.
But, evidently, they cannot be located
in space if there is no space.
And therefore there must be space
before any local relation of bodies
can be imagined as possible. Hence
you cannot maintain that space is
a mere relation.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Perhaps I shall be
obliged to say with Kant that space
is only a subjective form of the
mind.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Then you will entangle
yourself still more. The assumption
would imply the denial of all
real distances, of all real volumes,
of all real movements, of all real
phenomena, and of all natural laws.
For if space is only a subjective
form of our mind, then there is
no space out of the mind; and
consequently there are no real distances
and no real movements in
the outside world, and science becomes
an array of lies.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> What is, then, your
notion of space?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Space is the region of
<pb n='832'/><anchor id='Pg832'/>
all possible ubications and movements.
Do you accept this definition?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Why not? It is substantially
the same as that which I
have given by saying that space is
the capability of bodies and motion.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Very well. Then, since
I have shown that this capability
of bodies and motion is a positive
reality, space is a positive reality.
Moreover, space is neither matter
nor any of the forces of matter, nor
dependent on matter, but prior to
it, and is prerequired as a necessary
condition for the existence of matter.
Lastly, space is independent
of time and motion, and therefore
is absolutely and strictly eternal
and unchangeable. Do you object
to these conclusions?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> No, sir.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Then you concede that
space is an infinite, eternal, unchangeable,
independent reality,
prior to matter and above matter,
and therefore, according to your
own theory, prior to the world and
above it. Now, to concede so
much, and then to deny God, would
be an evident contradiction. For
you must admit that absolute space
is either a substance or not. If it
is a substance, then it is an infinite,
eternal, independent, unchangeable
substance, embracing and transcending
with its immensity all imaginable
worlds; and a substance
having such attributes is what we
call <hi rend='smallcaps'>God</hi>. If space is not a substance,
it must still have the reason
of its reality in a substance from
which it borrows its infinity, its
eternity, its immutability, and of
which it is the extrinsic manifestation.
Hence the contemplation
of the heavens and of <q>the immense
space interrupted by infinitely
distant and scattered groups
of worlds</q> affords an irresistible
proof of God's existence, and leaves
no room for your pretended <q>scientific</q>
objections. If there is no
God, there is no space; and if there
is no space, science is a dream and
scientists mere visionaries.<note place='foot'>The above doctrine concerning the reality of
absolute space is taken from Lessius' magnificent
work, <hi rend='italic'>De Perfectionibus Moribusque Divinis</hi> (lib.
ii. c. 2), where he shows that absolute space is
the virtuality of God's immensity. We cannot
here develop this doctrine, nor discuss the objections
of those who hold a different opinion. This
would lead us too far from our present object,
and give to our dialogue with Dr. Büchner a
higher metaphysical character than his arguments
deserve.</note>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> I cannot fight on this
ground, sir. Space is a mystery
which our reason has no power to
explain; and I decline to argue
about anything that transcends
reason. The strongest argument
in favor of the existence of a personal
God was ever drawn from
the necessity of a first mover, in
order to account for the movement
of the celestial bodies. But such a
necessity has never been proved;
and therefore <q>even in this remote
position a personal creative power
cannot hold its ground</q> (p. 52).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> You cannot cover your
retreat by pretending that space is
a mystery; for if space is a mystery,
then science also is a mystery&mdash;a
conclusion which you do
not accept. But while you thus
implicitly acknowledge your defeat,
you try to secure a safer position
by alleging that the movement of
the heavenly bodies may have
originated in the powers of matter
itself without any exterior impulse
from a first mover. I wish you
to remark that the words <q>first
mover</q> can be understood in two
manners; for not he only who directly
imparts the first movement,
but he also who governs the exertions
and establishes the conditions
on which the first movements depend,
<pb n='833'/><anchor id='Pg833'/>
can be called <q>first mover.</q>
The old philosophers, who did not
know the fact of universal gravitation,
proved the existence of God
by affirming the necessity of a first
mover&mdash;that is, of a first cause&mdash;giving
the first impetus to the heavens,
and governing their revolutions.
But since gravitation became
known philosophers have acknowledged
that all matter could receive
motion through the action
of other matter, and therefore
that the first movements in the material
world could arise from matter
itself, with no need of a special
impulse from without. This, however,
does not mean that we can
dispense with a <q>first mover.</q>
However great your effort to convince
yourself that <q>matter is eternal,
and the motion of matter as
eternal as matter itself</q> (p. 53), you
will not succeed. Matter is created;
and He who created it
placed it in definite conditions,
that it could exert its powers in a
definite manner and give rise to definite
effects. To him, therefore, as
to a first cause, are to be traced all
the movements arising from his
production and arrangement of all
the proximate causes. Now, the
first cause of all movements is a
<q>first mover.</q> What can science
object against this evident truth?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>Why matter assumed
a definite motion at a definite time
is as yet unknown to us; but the
investigations of science are as yet
incomplete, nor is it impossible
that we may get some clue as to
the period of the first origin of individual
worlds. Even at this day
astronomers give cogent reasons
that some of the nebular spots are
worlds in embryo, which, by gradual
condensation and rotation, will
become worlds and solar systems.
We have, therefore, concluding
from analogy, a right to say that
those processes through which the
existing solar systems have arisen
can have formed no exception to
the general laws inherent in matter,
and that the cause of the first definite
motion must have existed in
matter itself</q> (p. 53).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> This is possible; but is
it true?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>We are the more justified
in asserting this, as the many
irregularities, contingencies, etc.,
in the economy of the universe
and individual bodies, exclude the
thought of an external personal activity</q>
(<hi rend='italic'>ibid.</hi>)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> What? Are you serious?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>If it were the object
of a personal creative power to
create worlds and dwelling-places
for men and animals, why, we may
ask, these enormous, waste, useless
spaces, in which but here and
there suns and planets swim, floating
about as imperceptible points?
Why are not all planets of our system
so formed as to be inhabited
by man? Why is the moon without
water and atmosphere, and
consequently adverse to every organic
development? Wherefore
the irregularities and enormous differences
in the size and distances
of the planets of our solar system?
Why the deficiency in order, symmetry,
and beauty? Why have all
comparisons, analogies, speculations,
in regard to the number and
forms of the planets, proved idle
fancies? Why, asks Hudson Tuttle,
did the Creator give rings to
Saturn, which, surrounded by its
eight moons, can have little need
of them, while Mars is left in total
darkness? And again, the moon's
rotation round its axis is, in relation
to that of the earth, such that
it always presents to it the same
<pb n='834'/><anchor id='Pg834'/>
surface. What is the reason of
this? If there be design in this
arrangement, it must be admitted
that it is very imperfect. Why did
the Creator not impart to the celestial
bodies that order from which
the intention and the design could
irresistibly be inferred?</q> (pp. 53,
54).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Unfortunate man that
you are! You have already received
the just punishment of your
rebellion against truth; you have
been struck with blindness. The
thing is evident, say what you will.
You make a fool of yourself, as
your preposterous queries prove
nothing but your arrogance, ignorance,
and malice. You will never
be cured of your blindness till you
lower your tone and humble your
pride before the God whose works
you disregard, and whose wisdom
you call in question. You are a
smoky little candle challenging the
sun thus: <q>Why these enormous,
waste, useless spaces?</q> Is it necessary
to inform you that those
spaces are not waste and useless?
We have just seen that the expanse
of the heavens reveals the
infinity of the Creator; accordingly,
the enormous spaces which you
arrogantly call waste and useless
proclaim most eloquently the highest
truth, the necessary truth, the
source of all truths. <q>Why are
not all planets of our system so
formed as to be inhabited by
man?</q> In return let me ask you,
Why is not the atmosphere so
formed as to be inhabited by
fishes? Indeed, if God has no
need of peopling the air with fishes,
it would be hard to say on what
principle he can be obliged to people
the planets with beings exactly
similar to us in their organization.
It is plain that man, though the
best creature on earth, is not the
last effort of Omnipotence; there
can be rational beings made according
to other patterns, having a
different organization and different
needs. But whether there are or
not, it is not for you to ask why
the planets are not so made as to
be inhabited by man. It is no less
preposterous to ask, <q>Wherefore
the irregularities and enormous differences
in the size and distances
of the planets of our solar system?</q>
If the planets were all alike, and
their distances equal, would you
not pronounce the world monotonous,
and the plan of creation a
limited conception of an unintelligent
mind? But now it is variety
that offends your æsthetics; and
you denounce it as being <q>irregularity.</q>
Did you never hear that
variety is a source of beauty? To
me, the musician who always harps
on the same chord is a nuisance;
and I am sure that you too would
prefer a full orchestra, with all the
<q>irregularities and enormous differences
in the size, etc.,</q> of the instruments
employed. You find in
the heavens <q>a deficiency in order,
symmetry, and beauty.</q> This only
shows your bad taste. Do you
think that symmetry is indispensable
for beauty? An oak is beautiful,
though its branches are not
symmetrical. The sea-shore, the
hill, the valley, the mountain, would
lose much of their beauty, were
they to be reduced to symmetrical
forms. Then you speak of a want
of <q>order.</q> What do you imagine
order to be? Look on a chess-board
when the game is going on.
Is there any order? If you are no
chess-player, you will not perceive
order, but confusion; and yet there
is order. Order is a suitable disposition
of things in pursuance of
an end, and must be different when
it has to lead to a different end.
<pb n='835'/><anchor id='Pg835'/>
He who has no knowledge of the
end pursued cannot judge of the
suitableness or deficiency of the
arrangements made in view of such
an end. When you think that
the pieces are most disorderly mixed
up on the chess-board, then perhaps
they are in the most perfect
order, and the intelligent player
already knows that he is about to
checkmate his adversary. So do
not speak again of the order of the
heavens until you are called into
the secret council of Divinity. I
thought, doctor, that you had some
ability; yet how dull that man must
be who asks <q>why all comparisons,
analogies, speculations, in regard
to the number and forms of the
planets, have proved idle fancies</q>!
The <emph>why</emph> is evident. It is
because men are ignorant, and yet
presumptuous. But does our ignorance
show that there is a deficiency
of order in the heavens?
No; our ignorance only shows that
the best thing we can do is to hold
our tongue. As to the rings of Saturn,
what do you know besides
their existence? And how could
you show that, because Saturn has
eight moons, the rings can have no
duty to perform? But then, you
say, <q>Mars is left in total darkness.</q>
I reply that twelve hours
of darkness are not a <emph>total</emph> darkness.
Moreover, the dense atmosphere
and the small diameter of Mars are
calculated to afford it a long crepuscle,
which may shorten very
sensibly the length of its night.
And, after all, what need is there
that Mars should have a moon?
Could we not do on earth without
our moon? But you are scandalized
that our moon <q>always presents
to us the same surface,</q> and
never deigns to show its other side.
What a disorder! What an evidence
of a want of design! This
it is that causes you to exclaim that
<q>if there be design in this arrangement,
it must be admitted that it
is very imperfect.</q> I remark that
you here admit with Tuttle that
there may be design in this arrangement.
But if there is a design,
there is a designer. Who is he?
Is he not the Omnipotent? For
how can he fulfil his design if he
does not hold the heavens in his
hand? The design, however, in
your judgment, is imperfect. Why?
Only because your ignorance can
put a question to which it cannot
make an answer. You say: <q>Why
did the Creator not impart to the
celestial bodies that order from
which the intention and the design
could irresistibly be inferred</q>"
Your curiosity, doctor, lacks modesty.
What right have you to be
instructed in detail of the intentions
of the Creator? Is he not
the Master? Is he obliged to discover
his secrets to you, rebel and
arrogant being, who disregard the
most clear evidence of his very existence?
Would you be able to
understand his plan if he were willing
to reveal it? The heavens
proclaim God's existence and attributes;
they glorify him by their
beauty, variety, and harmony; they
reveal the general scope of creation;
but they withhold the secrets
which God has reserved for himself.
God's providence and his
government of the world are infinitely
wise, but they are inscrutable.

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Although you treat me
with little regard, and apply to me
very hard epithets, I wish to make
a short remark on what you call
<q>providence</q>: <q>Some perceive in
the position and relations of the
earth to the sun, moon, and stars a
designing providence; but they do
not consider that they confound
cause and effect, and that we should
<pb n='836'/><anchor id='Pg836'/>
be differently organized if the inclination
of the ecliptic were different
or not existing</q> (p. 55).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I think that you would
have done better if you had withheld
your remark. That I treat
you with little regard I do not deny;
but, in truth, I believe that if
you deserve respect as a doctor,
you deserve only contempt as the
author of <hi rend='italic'>Force and Matter</hi>. Freemasons
praise your person and extol
your book; be satisfied with
this. To us you are nothing but a
blind and obstinate sophist. If we
apply to you some hard epithet, you
gave us the fullest right to do so;
for remember that you have called
our great men <q>charlatans.</q> We,
at least, when we call you ignorant,
arrogant, presumptuous, take care
to prove that such epithets are well
applied; whilst you make denunciations,
and give no proofs.
</p>

<p>
And now as to your remark
about Providence. <q>Some,</q> you
say, <q>perceive in the position
and relations of the earth to the
sun, moon, and stars, a designing
providence.</q> Indeed, all great philosophers,
nay, all mankind, perceive
that designing providence;
but, from your words, it would
seem that this is only a peculiar
bias of a few obscure and eccentric
thinkers. Hence those words,
<q><emph>some</emph> perceive,</q> are calculated to
conceal or disguise a great historical
truth&mdash;the testimony of mankind
in favor of divine providence.
This may be called a trick. But
what follows is a real blunder.
Those who recognize a providential
order <q>do not consider,</q> according
to you, <q>that they confound
cause and effect.</q> Where is there
confusion? Do you mean that
what we call <q>Providence</q> is an
effect of natural laws?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Exactly so.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Natural laws are abstractions,
and abstractions can
produce nothing. Did you ever
imagine that a law of geometry
could make a circle, or that a law
of harmony could write a <foreign rend='italic'>quartetto</foreign>?
Laws do not produce facts, but
are gathered from facts of which
they exhibit the general expression.
Thus the natural laws are not natural
causes, but abstract formulas,
and do not rule the world, as scientists
too often assert, but only our
calculations and scientific inductions.
Your blunder is evident.
But is it true, at least, that <q>we
should be differently organized if
the inclination of the ecliptic were
different or not existing</q>? No,
doctor, you are not happy in your
illustration. A change of inclination
of the ecliptic would only alter
the <emph>distribution</emph> of heat on the terrestrial
surface without altering its
<emph>amount</emph>; and as now men can live
under different latitudes and in different
climes without being differently
organized, so also they would
live and thrive under some different
inclination of the ecliptic without
acquiring a different organization.
And if so, it would appear
that your physical knowledge is as
limited as your philosophical attainments.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Of course I am a doctor
in medicine, not in physics or
in philosophy; but this I know:
<q>that empirical philosophy, wherever
it may search for it, is nowhere
able to find a trace of a supernatural
influence, either in time
or space</q> (p. 55).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Quite true. Your <q>empirical
philosophy</q> is unable to
find anything supernatural, wherever
it may search for it. But are
you so simple as to believe that, if
there is a God, you should be able
to reach him with the telescope, or
<pb n='837'/><anchor id='Pg837'/>
to detect him by the microscope, or
to get by the balance an indication
of his presence, or to find him in
a retort, as a residue after some
chemical manipulation? Shame!
shame! Is this your method of
convincing yourself that there is no
God? Then, by shutting yourself
in a dark cellar, you should be able
also to convince yourself that the
sun does not exist. Is it not a
mockery to pretend that there is
nothing supersensible, <emph>because</emph> it
cannot be reached by experimentation
upon sensible things? I
cannot but repeat that you have
received the punishment of your
rebellion against truth. A man of
your ability would never fall into
such absurdities from want of light;
it is your hatred of truth that distorts
your reason and instigates you
to heap sophism upon sophism, and
blasphemy upon blasphemy. You
need not search for God; you know
him, and try in vain, like Cain, to
fly from his face.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> You make a sermon
rather than a discussion.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> But whose fault is it if
your assertions are so openly incongruous
as not to bear discussion?
Even your <q>empirical philosophy</q>
is a myth. Are you not
ashamed to appeal to a science
which has no existence? Chemistry
is empirical, and other parts of
physics may be empirical; but empirical
philosophy is nothing but a
bombastic word without meaning,
a fit conclusion to a chapter wherein
you try to make the heavens
bear witness against their Maker.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>X. The Earth.</head>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> After the heavens you
try to enlist the earth also among
your witnesses against God. But
what can the earth say in your
favor?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>The investigations of
geology have thrown a highly interesting
and important light on the
history of the origin and gradual
development of the earth. It was
in the rocks and strata of the crust
of the earth, and in the organic remains,
that geologists read, as in an
old chronicle, the history of the
earth. In this history they found
the plainest indications of several
stupendous successive revolutions,
now produced by fire, now by water,
now by their combined action.
These revolutions afforded, by the
apparent suddenness and violence
of their occurrence, a welcome pretext
to orthodoxy to appeal to the
existence of supernatural powers,
which were to have caused these
revolutions in order to render, by
gradual transitions, the earth fit for
certain purposes. This successive
periodical creation is said to have
been attended with a successive
creation of new organic beings and
species. The Bible, then, was right
in relating that God had sent a
deluge over the world to destroy a
sinful generation. God with his
own hands is said to have piled up
mountains, planed the sea, created
organisms, etc.</q> (p. 56).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> And so he did. But
mark that these Biblical expressions
are metaphorical.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>All these notions concerning
a direct influence of supernatural
or inexplicable forces have
melted away before the age of modern
science</q> (p. 57).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Melted away? Indeed?
And how?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>Like astronomy,
which with mathematical certainty
has measured the spaces of the heavens,
so does modern geology, by
taking a retrospective view of the
<pb n='838'/><anchor id='Pg838'/>
millions of years which have passed,
lift the veil which has so long concealed
the history of the earth, and
has given rise to all kinds of religious
and mysterious dreams</q> (<hi rend='italic'>ibid.</hi>)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> To call our views <q>religious
and mysterious dreams</q> is
no argument, doctor. We have a
history of the earth far more certain
than all your modern geology; and
that portion of geology which is not
fiction and charlatanism not only
does not contradict, but rather completes
and confirms, the Mosaic history.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> This is what I cannot
admit. <q>It is now known that
there can be no discussion about
those periodic creations of the earth
of which so much was said, and
which to this day an erroneous conception
of nature tries to identify
with the so-called days of creation
of the Bible; but that the whole
<emph>past</emph> of the earth is nothing but an
unfolded <emph>present</emph></q> (<hi rend='italic'>ibid.</hi>)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> You say, <q>It is known.</q>
No, sir, it is not known; it is only
wished. You infidels pretend to
know a great many things of which
you are ignorant. If you <emph>know</emph> that
geology refutes the Bible, how does
it happen that you cannot impart
to us such a knowledge in a rational
manner&mdash;that is, by proving what
you assert?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>Geology, supported
by the knowledge of surrounding
nature and its governing forces, is
enabled to trace the history of what
has happened in infinite periods of
time with approximating exactness,
frequently with certainty. It has
proved that everywhere and at all
times only those material and natural
forces were in activity by
which we are at present surrounded</q>
(p. 59).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> This cannot be proved
by geology.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>Nowhere was a point
reached when it was necessary to
stop scientific investigation, and to
substitute the influence of unknown
forces</q> (<hi rend='italic'>ibid.</hi>)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Not even for the origin
of life?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>Everywhere it was
possible to indicate or to conceive
the possibility of visible effects from
the combination of natural conditions;
everywhere existed the same
law and the same matter</q> (<hi rend='italic'>ibid.</hi>)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Of course. But this
does not exclude the intervention
of a superior cause.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>An enlightened intellect
no longer requires the aid of
that powerful hand which, acting
from without, excites the burning
spirits of the interior of the earth to
a sudden rebellion, which pours the
waters as a deluge over the earth,
and shapes for its designs the whole
structure like soft clay</q> (p. 60.)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> This is openly false.
All enlightened intellects acknowledge
that He who declared his intention
of desolating Sodom by fire
and the world by the Deluge must
have had a hand in the fulfilment
of his menace.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> This is your Bible history,
which we reject.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> But can you refute it?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> <q>How curious and
whimsical is not the conception of
a creative power, which conducts
the earth and its inhabitants through
various transitions and immense periods
of time to a more developed
form, in order to make it finally a
fit dwelling-place for the most organized
animal&mdash;man! Can an arbitrary
and almighty power require
such efforts to attain its object?
Can it not immediately and without
delay do and create what seems
good to it? Why these roundabouts?
The natural difficulties
<pb n='839'/><anchor id='Pg839'/>
alone which matter meets with in the
gradual combinations and formations
of its parts can explain to us
the peculiarity of the origin of the organic
and inorganic world</q> (p. 60).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> It is ridiculous to speak
of <q>efforts</q> of the Almighty; for
no one but a fool could dream of
such an absurdity. Moreover, you
confound <hi rend='italic'>creation</hi> with <hi rend='italic'>formation</hi>.
By creation matter received existence
immediately, without <q>roundabouts</q>;
for creation is not movement,
and therefore needs no time.
This creation of matter was the
work of God alone; but the formation
of the earth was successively
brought about, according to God's
plan, through the exertion of the
natural powers, which were not created
to remain idle, but to carry on
the objects intended by their Creator.
Now, the exertion of natural
powers could not give rise to a perfect
order of things <q>immediately
and without roundabouts.</q> Hence
your argument is worthless; and it
is worthless precisely on account
of the <q>difficulties which matter
meets with in the gradual combinations
and formations</q> of complex
things. But matter meets with a
much greater difficulty, which you
omit to mention. The difficulty
is that matter does not know how
to form a molecule of hydrogen;
and yet there is hydrogen.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> It chanced to be formed
by nature.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Indeed? Chance might
form <emph>one</emph> molecule, or <emph>two</emph>, but could
not form millions of millions of
them <hi rend='italic'>all perfectly equal</hi> to one
another, for chance excludes uniformity.
Nor does it avail to say
that their formation is the work of
nature; for nature, according to you,
is only matter, and consequently it
cannot do more than matter itself is
capable of doing.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Science is still imperfect;
we cannot as yet explain everything.
But geologists refute the
Bible as to the six days of creation.
<q>The so-called coal formation alone
required, according to Bischof,
1,004,177; according to Chevandier's
calculation, 672,788 years.
The tertiary strata, about 1,000 feet
in thickness, required for their development
about 350,000 years; and
before the originally incandescent
earth could cool down from a temperature
of 2,000 degrees to 200,
there must, according to Bischof's
calculation, have elapsed a period
of 350 millions of years. Volger
finally calculates that the time requisite
for the deposit of the strata
known to us must at least have
amounted to 648 millions of years!
From these numbers we may form
some notion as to the extent of
these periods of time. They give
us, moreover, another hint. The
enormous distances in the universe
which stagger our imagination, in
combination with these almost unlimited
periods of time, lead us to
acknowledge that both time and
space are infinite and eternal</q> (p.
61).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> You are always the same.
Your conclusion that time is <emph>infinite</emph>
is pinned on the statement
that the periods of geology are <emph>almost</emph>
unlimited&mdash;that is, not altogether
without limit. I need not
show that such a rash conclusion is
contradicted by your very calculations.
And again, as to the geological
periods themselves, their
length does not clash with the six
days of creation as described by
the Bible. The word <q>day</q> is
often used in the Bible to express
a great interval of time, and may
be interpreted as an <q>epoch,</q> or,
as you say, a <q>period.</q> This is,
in fact, the interpretation of the
<pb n='840'/><anchor id='Pg840'/>
word now accepted by our writers
when explaining the days of creation.
Only our writers, more prudent
than you, do not pretend to
determine the length of those epochs
or periods; for they do not indulge
in wild calculations or imaginary
data. When we see a difference of
331,389 years between the results
of two calculations regarding the
period of the coal formation, we
may well suspend our judgment,
and not commit ourselves by the
premature choice of either opinion.
But we admit the periods, nor are
we afraid of identifying them with
the days of creation. The Bible
has nothing to fear from geology or
any other science. We might, on
the contrary, prove from geology
the truth and divine inspiration of
the Mosaic narrative. Moses was
no geologist, and could not know
the order of the events which took
place before the creation of man,
except by supernatural revelation.
Now, in his cosmogony we observe
not only the description of an order
of events like that deduced from
modern geology, but <q>a system in
the arrangement, and a far-reaching
prophecy,</q> as Prof. Dana well
remarks,<note place='foot'>J. D. Dana's <hi rend='italic'>Manual of Geology</hi>. See also
Pianciani's <hi rend='italic'>Cosmogonia Naturale Comparata col
Genesi</hi>, Rev. Gerald Molloy's <hi rend='italic'>Geology and Revelation</hi>,
and Card. Wiseman's <hi rend='italic'>Twelve Lectures
on the Connection between Science and Revealed
Religion</hi>.</note> <q>to which philosophy could
not have attained, however instructed.</q>
You see, doctor, that your
geological periods, instead of refuting
the Bible, furnish us with a new
argument in support of its divine
origin. Have you anything to reply?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> Your explanation of the
Bible is quite new.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> Be it so. Our ancient
doctors, however, knew very well
that the word <q>day</q> in the Bible
frequently means a great length of
time. Had they known geology,
they would have unanimously interpreted
the six days as six great
geological periods, just as we do.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Büchner.</hi> But I have still other
arguments deduced from the primeval
generations.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Reader.</hi> I am ready to meet them.
But I really think it is scarcely
worth the trouble to continue the
discussion, as you have hitherto
uniformly failed in every point you
have tried to establish.

The loveliest of autumn days
shed its warmth and brightness over
magnificent Rome, while the bells
from many towers announced the
hour of twelve, and a still more emphatic
reminder of mid-day boomed
from Castle Sant' Angelo, the
firing of whose cannon frequently
startles strangers, though even
they soon become unconscious of
its loud report. Citizens meeting
complained of the horrible sirocco
day; visitors congratulated one another
upon such beautiful weather
for the fulfilment of their plans; and
a very perceptible thing was that not
even in the Eternal City can every
individual be satisfied. In no way
could an unbeliever be better convinced
of this solemn truth than
by a peep into the principal parlor of
the Hôtel d'Angleterre, where a travelling
party had just arrived. An
elderly gentleman stamped up and
down the apartment, furiously gesticulating,
and undoubtedly making
use of rather forcible language,
consigning hotels in general, and the
Hôtel d'Angleterre in particular, to
pretty uncomfortable quarters. At
every approach to a small tête-à-tête
placed near the window he fiercely
glared upon a lady, evidently his
wife, whose sweet, smiling face served
to exasperate her husband beyond
endurance. A large fan, plied
industriously, stirred not only the
black feathers of her own bonnet,
but the scarlet ones jauntily stuck
in a dark gray hat that persistently
drooped, for no reason in the world
but to conceal a very amused
countenance which might have added
fuel to the fire of the gentleman's
anger. Though for a time he
is denied the gratification of a peep
at so winning a face, we will take it
ourselves, and see what is under that
gray hat with the scarlet plumes:
A pair of dark eyes sparkling
with fun, which all those curling
black lashes cannot hide, while a
few saucy rings of hair, lying here
and there on the forehead, cause a
surmise as to whether they are the
result of nature and warm weather
or curl-papers nightly twisted up.
It would be difficult to form an estimate
of a mouth whose under-lip is
being held in bondage by two rows
of exceedingly white teeth, but we
will imagine it a rose-bud, and hasten
to make the acquaintance of
yonder thunder-cloud, who pouts so
abominably, and is still so like her
of the mischievous aspect. Agathe
Waring leaned on the back of her
chair, and, when her father stamped
his feet, she did likewise; when his
frown deepened and voice waxed
louder, her pout became more decided,
and very beautiful hands
doubled into fists that shook defiantly
at invisible landlords. Mrs.
Waring, observing this, remarked:
<q>I think, Agathe, you have chosen
a dangerous employment for hands
so valued as yours. Do you not
fear your vehemence will be the
cause of a sprained wrist or finger?
Then where will be our delightful
evening music. A young lady who,
at the faintest suspicion of danger
ahead, generally clasps her hands
behind her, is to be wondered
at when seen bravely challenging
our most dreaded enemies.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It may be very amusing to you
<pb n='844'/><anchor id='Pg844'/>
and Kathleen, mamma; but I confess
to not perceiving the joke,</q> replied
Agathe, glancing complacently
at her formidable weapons. <q>How
you can see papa so worried, and
be perfectly unconcerned, is more
than I understand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, my dear, would it mend
matters in the least were your sister
to weep tears of vexation, and I to
vociferate against the unfortunate
people of this hotel, who were never
less in fault than now? If your father
had taken my advice, and telegraphed
for rooms, this occasion for
trouble would have been avoided;
but, as he considered such a precaution
unnecessary, we need not
regard ourselves as dreadfully-injured
travellers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Am I not sufficiently annoyed,
madam, by this turn of affairs,</q>
shouted the elderly gentleman, <q>that
<emph>you</emph> should consider it essential to
remind me what your advice was in
Florence? I have never yet met
the woman who did not delight in
being able to say, <q>I told you so.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Now, papa,</q> said Kathleen with
a merry glance from her bright eyes,
<q>I look upon that speech as a
calumny and an injustice to Agathe.
When all our luggage was left in
Paris, simply because you would not
heed her injunction to be very
careful in looking after it, she did
not gratify herself by any such malicious
words as <q>I told you so.</q>
Indeed, her sympathy was far greater
than ours, as we only felt indignant
at having nothing to wear.</q>
</p>

<p>
This boldly-uttered sentence
proved quite soothing to Mr. Waring,
who ceased his restless walk to
twine an arm about his daughter's
waist, whose head leaned fondly
against the dusty sleeve, and desired
no sweeter resting-place.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, whatever my faults, whatever
my grievances, this little daughter
is ready and willing to share
them,</q> said he, gently patting Agathe's
cheek. <q>It has always been
a wonder to me that a brute like
myself should possess three treasures
such as my wife and daughters.
But the more valuable the treasure,
the more difficult its keeping. If
that atrocious landlord will only give
us an apartment for this afternoon,
I'll go in quest of permanent quarters,
and leave you to rest until my
return.</q>
</p>

<p>
An immediate ringing of the bell
brought the attendant, who was requested
to inquire into the possibility
of procuring at least a single
room for the remainder of the day,
during which time other accommodations
might be sought. An answer,
to the effect that there was a small
chamber, engaged by a party who
would arrive that night, which until
then was at the service of the American
gentleman, caused a gathering
together of bags, boxes, and baskets,
an ascent of several stairs, and a
happy entrance into the nicely-furnished
and exceedingly pleasant
apartment. The waiter, before his
departing bow, made many apologies
for the crowded condition of
the house having rendered it impossible
to receive monsieur, and
hoped their inability to please would
be forgiven. Mr. Waring's wrath,
until then on the wane, appeared
gradually gaining ascendency, and a
convenient lunch-basket would certainly
have made the acquaintance
of the waiter's head had not the
latter prudently withdrawn. <q>The
impudence of that dog in presuming
to beg my pardon! What do I care
how crowded the house may be or
how impossible it is to accommodate
us? I don't suppose this hotel is the
only habitable place in Rome; if
so, I'll just take up my abode in the
Colosseum, and be done with it.</q>
</p>

<pb n='845'/><anchor id='Pg845'/>

<p>
Neither Mrs. Waring nor Agathe
could resist smiling at this outburst,
while Kathleen laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall consider it my first duty,
on entering the Colosseum, to set
you up as a statue of Perversity,
surrounded by imps of contradiction.
During the last half-hour you
have been in a towering passion because
the Hôtel d'Angleterre could
not contain you. Now the poor
waiter humbly laments the numerous
visitors and non-elastic material of
the house, and you are ready to annihilate
him for supposing us anxious
to remain in it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you not ashamed of yourself,
Kathleen Waring?</q> cried Agathe.
<q>Were I papa, you should not
speak to me in that rude manner.
You surely do not approve of it,
mamma?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My dear Agathe,</q> said her mother,
<q>I cannot disapprove when I
so fully appreciate the spirit in
which your sister thus addresses her
father. Do not imagine you are
alone in your affection for him, and
that the sole mode of expressing that
affection is by unvarying respectfulness
in language and constant
caressing. We all know you to be
more dignified than Kathleen, and
to possess much greater stability
of character; then how can you
expect her to be otherwise than more
thoughtless and much saucier than
yourself?</q>
</p>

<p>
This last sentence, accompanied
by a meaning smile, brought a
crimson flush to Agathe's cheek
and an angry retort to her lips, the
utterance of which was stayed by a
kiss from her sister, who whispered:
</p>

<p>
<q>Never mind, Aggie; just be as
firm and stable and dignified as you
choose. I'll be your admiration-point
for ever, and I am sure mamma
is as proud of her model of
strength and her impersonation of
sauciness as she can be; then why
need we quarrel?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, it <emph>would</emph> be a waste of
ammunition, mavourneen,</q> replied
Agathe; <q>so, instead of letting loose
my tongue, I'll exercise my arms.
Be good enough to get me the
clothes-brush from your bag, that I
may dust papa's coat.</q>
</p>

<p>
By plentiful application of soap
and vigorous use of towels Mr.
Waring now appeared resplendent,
and announced his intention of at
once going in search of rooms. <q>In
my absence,</q> said he, pausing at
the door, <q>I desire the three treasures
to repose, and hope to find
them bright and sparkling this evening.</q>
</p>

<p>
The ladies did retire, and slept
soundly several hours, while Mr.
Waring made every effort to obtain
a suite of rooms, first at the different
hotels, which were all full, next at
two or three <foreign rend='italic'>casas</foreign> recommended
by his banker. At last in a small
house, opening on the Piazza di
Spagna, he succeeded in engaging
five bright, cheerful apartments,
though at quite a high price, since
the number of visitors at Rome increased
rents far beyond their usual
rate. Leaving orders with his <foreign rend='italic'>padrone</foreign>
to secure a man-servant as
soon as possible, he next made arrangements
with the proprietor of
the nearest restaurant to supply
him with the necessary breakfast
and dinner, which must be daily occurrences
to sustain the vitality of
even the most enthusiastic tourist.
With a sigh of relief that his preparations
were complete, Mr. Waring
returned to the hotel, and found
his wife and daughters radiant in
their fresh toilets and expectant
eagerness. There is nothing so destructive
of beauty as fatigue added
to the dust and soot of railway travelling;
<pb n='846'/><anchor id='Pg846'/>
and an individual emerging
from this double ordeal deserves
the congratulation of friends. Mr.
Waring bestowed a gaze of admiration
upon each lady in turn, kissed
his wife, pulled one of Agathe's curls,
and whirled Kathleen round and
round to the tune of a cracked
hand-organ stationed beneath the
window, which just then ground
out a very fine waltz. Breathless
and panting, Kathleen soon sank
on the sofa, while her mother came
to the rescue with a fan, and Agathe
opened the window to throw
the musician some coppers.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is little need to inform
us of your success,</q> said Mrs. Waring,
<q>as this emphatic greeting
tells its own tale. I am really glad
you were able to return before dark,
as we feared you might be detained
later.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, you cannot fail to like
the rooms,</q> said Mr. Waring; <q>for
they are five in number, quite handsomely
furnished, and two overlook
the Piazza di Spagna. I think, as
it is a mere step from here, we had
better walk, and have our luggage
sent by these people. If you are
half as tired riding as I am, you
will infinitely prefer proceeding to
our destination on foot.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We should like nothing better!</q>
cried the three ladies, and immediately
began to collect their scattered
property. This being duly disposed
of, the black bonnet and gray
hats donned, our party set out.
The Ave Maria was ringing, and
the sweet sound of many bells penetrated
the hearts of even these
Protestants, who understood so imperfectly
its beautiful significance.
Dusk was fast changing into darkness,
while black clouds chased
each other over the sky, and the
rising wind betokened the sure approach
of a storm. Our travellers
hastened their footsteps, and only
reached their parlor when a terrific
flash of lightning poured through
the windows, and the rain fell in
torrents. Mr. and Mrs. Waring at
once went on a tour of investigation,
in which neither of the girls
could be induced to join. Agathe
approached the window and gazed
upon the outdoor fury, with only
clasped hands and awe-stricken
countenance to betoken her feeling.
Kathleen buried a miserably pale
face in the cushions of her armchair,
and sobbed most piteously;
for the poor child dreaded nothing
so much as thunder and lightning.
After a short lapse of time, Agathe
turned impatiently from her post
of observation, and exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
<q>Without exception, Katy, you
are the greatest goose I ever met,
to be sitting there crying when you
might have the benefit of yonder
magnificent panorama. It is <emph>too</emph>
absurd that the least sign of a storm
must send you into hysterics. Do
you not suppose there is quite as
much danger for me as for you?
Yet let me sob as you are doing, and
how foolish you would think me! Do
control yourself this once, or your
eyes will be red and ugly to-morrow,
and you not presentable.</q>
</p>

<p>
Agathe had intended simple expostulation;
but anger got the better
of her, and her last words were
very commanding&mdash;so much so as
to rouse Kathleen, who cried:
</p>

<p>
<q>I am sure I don't care for eyes,
or appearance, or anything else, and
I wish you would let me alone.
Because you have a reputation for
courage and firmness, you imagine
you are justified in persecuting me;
but I tell you you are not. I cannot
see any great courage and firmness
in facing that lightning. If
there should ever be a call upon
me for such qualities, I will beg
<pb n='847'/><anchor id='Pg847'/>
the good Lord to give them to me,
but not for the purpose of staring
at a storm.</q> With this the dark head
again took refuge in the cushions,
and Agathe returned to her former
position. The scene was indeed
magnificent, and fully compensated
for any uneasy feeling she might
have experienced in thus exposing
herself. The entire sky within
range of vision seemed one dense,
black cloud, hanging but a few feet
above the house-tops, every moment
sending forth flashes of light,
at times sharp, forked, fearful,
again soft, widespread, and of sufficient
duration to illumine the entire
piazza beneath. The pouring
rain could not conceal surrounding
objects, but rather served to enhance
their beauty, since they appeared
through a mist that served
to screen the hard, substantial reality.
High up, beyond the fine steps
which are a prominent feature in this
piazza, rose the church and convent
of the Trinità di Monte, looking,
in its elevation and noble
strength, a fit emblem of a religion
so true and sublime. Inclining
from its height to the level beneath,
the aforesaid steps were lonely and
deserted, deprived of their lounging
idlers, but nevertheless beautifully
reflecting from their wet surface
the brightness above. One might
have imagined the piazza, with its
brilliant shops, <foreign rend='italic'>caffes</foreign>, hotels, and
booths, to be the noisy, bustling
world, having in its midst those
steps so numerous, so difficult of
ascent, but in the end leading to
rest, peace, heaven! How pitiful,
then, to see no foot ascending! And
if this little picture be one of sorrow,
how much worse the great,
real world, where so few mount the
stairs within reach of all! Some
walk round, others glance up and
promise a beginning to-morrow;
but how many heed the warning?
Now, <emph>now</emph> is the time; to-morrow
may never come!
</p>

<p>
It is not probable, however, that
such thoughts found favor with
Agathe, whose Protestant mind was
in no way addicted to pious musing,
since her church furnishes such
meagre food for heart and brain.
Her eyes, roving restlessly about,
suddenly became fixed upon the
tall, muffled figure of a man hurrying
through the rain with bent
head and quickening speed. Devoid
of fear, of suspicion, she watched
until he neared the piazza's centre,
when, after one long, blinding
streak of lightning, a fearful crash
followed, and she distinguished the
object of her curiosity lying prostrate
on the ground. A sharp cry
from her lips brought Mrs. Waring,
to whom, with trembling limbs and
horror-stricken face, she pointed
out the prostrate form. Kathleen,
who had crept up behind her mother,
no sooner beheld it than she
ran from the room, and, meeting
her father in the hall, breathlessly
exclaimed: <q>O papa! do go quickly....
There is a poor man lying
in the street who has been struck, ...
and nobody seems to know
it. Please go to him.... Bring
him here. Get some one to help
you; for he may not be quite dead.</q>
</p>

<p>
Before she had ceased speaking
her father was down-stairs ordering
a servant to follow him; and from
their position Mrs. Waring and
Agathe saw the two rush into the
driving rain, gently raise the body,
and carefully bear it towards the
entrance. Kathleen had hastily arranged
pillows and blankets on the
sofa; so there was no delay in fixing
something on which to lay the poor
fellow, and very soon the entire
family were making a desperate
effort to restore animation, as Mr.
<pb n='848'/><anchor id='Pg848'/>
Waring declared there was life in
the body. His assertion was verified
when, after a while, the young
man drew a long breath, and opened
such bewildered, astonished eyes
as made every one smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! my fine fellow,</q> cried Mr.
Waring, <q>I'll wager you you are
on the road to life again, and we
are spared the trouble of attending
your funeral&mdash;a thing, I candidly
assure you, I had expected to do not
very long ago.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O papa!</q> whispered Kathleen,
glancing timidly at the pale face,
blue eyes, and curling brown hair,
<q>don't talk to the poor fellow about
funerals when he has been so near
the grave; it cannot be pleasant.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Never mind, Miss Puss, I will
set him straight,</q> replied her father.
<q>Now, my friend, I have always
heard, and there is an indistinct
idea of my having read it,
that people struck by lightning
never feel it. As you are a living
witness to the truth or falsehood
of this statement, I would like to
have your views on the subject.</q>
</p>

<p>
This, delivered with the air of
a man thirsting for knowledge,
brought a smile to the patient's
mouth, and caused a general laugh.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am truly grieved,</q> replied
the lightning-struck, <q>that my
knowledge is of questionable authority,
because I cannot tell
whether I felt a blow on the head
or not, though there is a half-defined
recollection of some one
pounding me there, and producing
about five hundred simultaneous
sensations; whether really so or
the fruit of my active imagination
I am unable to avow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, for our own satisfaction,
we will believe you <emph>did</emph> have five
hundred feelings jumbled together,
and take it as a warning to avoid
like strokes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Such profanity shall not be allowed!</q>
said Mrs. Waring; <q>and I
really think, Mr. Waring, you should
conduct our patient to a comfortable
room where he may sleep
away his weakness. Kathleen will
share Agathe's apartment, that he
may occupy hers.</q>
</p>

<p>
All protestations to the effect
that he could walk to his hotel
being indignantly denied, the young
man was immediately consigned to
bed, and commanded to sleep as
long as he could. For about half
an hour the family sat up discussing
the accident, and did not separate
until its victim was unanimously
pronounced handsome, elegant,
charming!
</p>

<p>
The sun was many hours high
next morning before our friends
thought of stirring, and the two
girls were yet sound asleep when
their mother came tapping at the
door. Her knock was so slight as
to be scarcely perceptible, and, receiving
no response, she entered.
The change from bright sunshine
to this darkened room at first
made it impossible to distinguish
clearly; but opening the blind a
very little way, Mrs. Waring smiled
to herself, as, glancing about the
apartment, she murmured: <q>Those
careless, careless girls! What is to
be done with them?</q> Evidently,
the careless girls had taken small
trouble to arrange their things before
retiring, and now a somewhat
confused picture greeted the despairing
mother's eye. The bureau
appeared the favorite receptacle
for almost all articles. A colossal
brush, instead of properly
supporting the rightful partner of
its joys and sorrows, made desperate
love to an ink-stand, a red
bow, and a bottle of cologne, whose
stopple had stepped over the way
to consult an oracle of a watch
<pb n='849'/><anchor id='Pg849'/>
about the probable comfort of the
poor, deserted comb that patiently
reposed on a prickly pin-cushion.
The oracle, unwound and unmoved,
refused utterance, and sullenly
stared at a crowd of rings, bracelets,
belts, reticules, hair-pins, false
curls, and handkerchiefs indiscriminately
gathered together. They
were not interested in the watch,
but bemoaned the sad fate of a
coquettish gray hat with a scarlet
plume, one string of which had
caught in a tightly-shut drawer,
and cruelly hung its fair possessor.
A grand civil war had transpired
in other parts of the room; the
washstand implements were horribly
mutilated and dashed about;
the four shoes and stockings had
taken leave of each other, and angrily
stationed themselves in different
corners; and, last, a huge trunk
had brutally emptied itself of its
contents, that now lay limp and
helpless, here, there, everywhere.
</p>

<p>
Had not Mrs. Waring been well
accustomed to such a display, it
is possible she might have been
dismayed; but as nothing is equal
to habit, she preserved her equanimity,
and, approaching the nearest
bed, her attention was at once
arrested by a tiny pair of beads
which she perceived dangling from
Kathleen's wrist. With a dark
frown she retreated to the door,
and cried:
</p>

<p>
<q>Girls! girls! it is time to get
up. You have slept long enough
even for weary travellers, and your
patient has been waiting an hour
to see the young ladies before
taking leave. Do hurry and come
at once to the parlor.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, mamma, we will,</q> answered
two very lazy voices.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, my dears, I do not doubt
it,</q> said Mrs. Waring; <q>but let me
see you well out of those two comfortable
beds, as you cannot be
trusted in my absence.</q>
</p>

<p>
In the midst of the commotion
which followed Mrs. Waring escaped,
and, slowly walking along
the hall, murmured:
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it possible Kathleen still retains
those absurd convent notions,
and am I ever to regret having
sent her to Mt. de C&mdash;&mdash;? Surely,
in three years she must have forgotten
those ridiculous impressions;
yet what does that rosary
mean, and why should she sleep
with it encircling her arm? Well,
it will only make matters worse to
discuss them, and, until I am certain
what the poor child intends, I
shall say nothing.</q>
</p>

<p>
By this time the drawing-room
was reached, and, entering, Mrs.
Waring found her husband and
their guest in hot dispute as to
the best manner of sight-seeing in
Rome. Mr. Waring expressed abhorrence
of guide-books and his
resolution never to use them. The
stranger intimated such a resolve
rash. Mr. Waring inquired why.
The young man said guide-books
being absolutely essential in a place
so filled with objects of interest as
Rome, he was willing to wager Mr.
Waring would have three or four
in his possession by the end of the
week. Mr. Waring indignantly repudiated
this idea, and the argument
might have continued indefinitely
had not the girls made an
opportune appearance. In their
wake came a delicious breakfast,
after partaking of which the young
man rose to depart.
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot,</q> said he, <q>pretend to
thank you for such kindness to a
stranger, for words are inadequate
to express my gratitude. My obligations
will be increased tenfold if
you only permit me to continue an
acquaintance so happily begun.</q>
</p>

<pb n='850'/><anchor id='Pg850'/>

<p>
<q>My dear fellow,</q> cried Mr.
Waring, <q>don't mention gratitude;
and as for an acquaintance happily
begun, if you choose to consider as
such one brought on by lightning,
we are at your disposal, and nothing
will delight us more than receiving
you as our friend. But
friends should know what to call
one another, and, though my name
is Alexander Waring, yours is still
a dead secret.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A thousand pardons!</q> exclaimed
the stranger. <q>My negligence is
truly shocking; but it is Mr. and
Mrs. Waring, with their lovely
daughters, who have charmed me
into a forgetfulness of Howard Lee,
and it is they who must forgive
him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Of the two lovely daughters,
Kathleen pouted bewitchingly at
the foregoing speech, while Agathe
gracefully inclined her head. The
gentlemen shook hands most heartily,
and Mrs. Waring cordially invited
Mr. Lee to return often, assuring
him of a sincere welcome.
Thus, amidst compliments and acknowledgments
on both sides, Howard
Lee took leave of his friends,
promising to see them very soon
again.
</p>

<p>
It is scarcely necessary to add
that the promise was observed, and
during the next month or two he
was almost constantly one of the
gay little party which roved among
the grand old ruins of Rome,
wandered about its art-galleries
and into its temples and churches,
always consulting guide-books with
a faith in, and a dependence on
them that undoubtedly made Mr.
Lee winner of his wager. It is
very remarkable what wonderful
things can transpire in a little while,
though we are not certain whether
you consider it remarkable that
Mr. Lee soon manifested extraordinary
interest in the movements of
Miss Kathleen. If that young person
chose to stare an old statue out
of countenance, she would not be
long without the assistance of another
pair of eyes that had suddenly
remembered some never-before-known
merit about the image, and
were instantly intent on it. If
Kathleen thought proper to sit
among the ruins, he, completely
overcome by fatigue, would rest by
her side. We are much afraid this
was not all that happened; for
there were certainly some very ardent
glances sent from his eyes to
her sparkling black ones, that softened
and glowed as they drank in
the language of the blue ones. And
at every new approach of the tall,
manly figure didn't the gray hat
with the scarlet plume droop lower
and lower; didn't the round, dimpled
cheeks beneath rival the
feather in color; didn't the little
hands clasp each other tightly, that
their trembling might not make too
bold a confession of her happy agitation?
You cannot be surprised
that, standing together by the beautiful
Trevi fountain one moonlight
night, to her was told in eloquent
tones the old, old story which every
woman hears once in her life, be she
ever so poor, so ugly, so disagreeable.
But this woman was lovely, bewitching;
and the tale seemed exquisite
harmony when softly, beseechingly
it fell upon such ears. Long after
the low voice had ceased telling what
was music to her soul Kathleen stood
silent. The water dashed from
and over rocks in playful sport,
defying the peaceful glance of the
moon, which bade it be quiet. The
church-bells rang out the hour of
ten, and from the distance sounded
Agathe's laugh, with the accompanying
expostulation from several
ladies and gentlemen who were
<pb n='851'/><anchor id='Pg851'/>
begging her to sing. At last clear
and full to these lovers came the
sweet old song, <q>Kathleen Mavourneen.</q>
Howard waited till the
music died away, then whispered,
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! spare me, spare me,</q> cried
Kathleen. <q>I cannot, cannot answer!
If you but knew!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And do I not know you are
what I love with all my heart, what
I long to call my own? Have you
not encouraged me? allowed me
to believe you cared for me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh! I never meant it. I would
not have had you know that I cared
for you. Have pity on me, Mr.
Lee, and do not ask why! I can
give no answer to your kind words.
Believe me that it is best as it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Miss Waring, your friends are
coming&mdash;will interrupt us in one
minute; can you give me <emph>no</emph> hope?
Is there nothing you will say to
comfort my yearning heart?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All I can say is, Wait; in a little
while you will cease to wish for
my affection when you have learned
what it is essential you should
know before I can give an answer
to your question.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing can change my desire,</q>
pleaded Howard, gazing upon the
tear-laden eyelashes and trembling
lips. <q>Only tell me now what you
think I must know, and then see
if it makes the slightest difference.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Mr. Howard,</q> said Kathleen,
regaining composure, <q>wait a
few days; then I will either send
for you or write what I have to
communicate. With you will rest
the decision. Remember always
that I have cared for you, and that
now it is a sad good-night I wish
you, knowing it may be my last.</q>
</p>

<p>
Here they were joined by their
party, and Kathleen flying to the
protection of her mother's arm,
Mr. Lee took his place by Agathe's
side, and thus they returned home.
Poor Kathleen passed a miserable
night, and awoke next morning
with head aching so badly as to
prevent her appearance at breakfast.
Towards noon she improved,
and by three o'clock presented herself
in the drawing-room, where
were her mother and sister. Telling
them she was going out for a
little fresh air, and to feel no uneasiness
if she did not immediately
return, she left the house, ran
across the piazza, up the steps, and
stood in front of the Trinità di
Monte. Pausing a minute, <q>This
is the 8th of December, the Feast
of the Immaculate Conception, so
certainly there must be Benediction
here this afternoon, as they
tell me the church belongs to the
Ladies of the Sacred Heart. I'll
try, anyhow.</q>
</p>

<p>
The little portress, in her very
ugly cap, informed <foreign rend='italic'>la signorina</foreign>,
<q>Yes, benediction would be given
in one hour from that time. Would
she walk into the chapel now and
wait, or would she prefer going
away to return?</q> <foreign rend='italic'>La signorina</foreign>
would wait; so she was shown into
the church, and there left to her
own reflections, which were one
long struggle with feelings so contrary
that to make them agree was
impossible. The poor child had,
ever since leaving the convent of
Mt. de C&mdash;&mdash;, been praying for
courage to avow a faith which she
knew would anger her father, distress
that darling mother, and call
forth words of bitter ridicule from
Agathe. Now to these considerations
was added the fear of losing
Howard Lee's affection.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,</q>
she cried, <q>help me in this my
agony. Send down upon me your
<pb n='852'/><anchor id='Pg852'/>
blessing, that I may be strengthened
in the path which has become
so difficult to my faltering feet!
Endow my heart with that courage
I once boasted I would ask for
when its need should be discovered.
O my Father in heaven! look
upon thy child with pity, and heed
her earnest supplication.</q>
</p>

<p>
For an entire hour she wavered
between the earthly devotion that
awaited but a word to be hers,
and the higher Love, that requires
many crosses and sacrifices before
it recompenses the heart. It will
never desert, never wound. The
sun sank lower in the heavens, and
the light in the chapel took a soft,
mysterious tone that lent supernatural
quiet and stillness to the
place, greatly soothing Kathleen's
restless mind. Her head leaning
on the railing in front of her, her
lips moving in unconscious prayer,
she fell into a deep, dreamless
sleep that was only disturbed
when over her senses stole the
faint sound of music, gradually,
gradually unclosing those delighted
eyes shining with blissful wonder,
as she supposed it all must have
been a dream, from which she waked
to find herself safe in the dear
old convent. Surely, there was the
beautiful altar, the Blessed Sacrament
exposed, many candles burning
amid vases of exquisite flowers,
the venerable priest kneeling at the
altar's foot; above all, the convent
girls, in blue uniforms and white
veils, entering two by two, making
their genuflections, and standing
in their places till all were ready,
when tap! from the Sisters' bench,
and down they sat. From the organ-loft
the sweet litany she knew
so well came pouring into her ears
just as of yore; as of yore the
priest, the Sisters, and convent
girls sang in familiar tones:
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>Mater Christi,</q></l>
<l>Mater divinæ gratiæ,</l>
<l><q rend='post'>Mater purissima.</q></l>
</lg>

</quote>

<p>
With happy heart and tearful
eyes she sang out the <hi rend='italic'>Ora pro
nobis</hi>, while many looked to see
from whence came the joyful
notes, so splendidly swelling their
chorus. Through the litany, the
<hi rend='italic'>O Salutaris!</hi> and the <hi rend='italic'>Tantum Ergo</hi>
her strong, young voice was clear and
sweet, and none guessed that in
the girl's heart a fearful struggle
had taken place, and that there
the good Lord had come and left
a gift which would never decay,
never be worthless, but ever bright
and glorious. A last prayer for
strength was uttered during Benediction,
and Kathleen felt half her
difficulties were overcome when
she stood up at the <hi rend='italic'>Laudate Dominum</hi>.
</p>

<p>
That night she confessed to her
parents her intention of becoming
a Catholic, and besought their permission
to take the step. Mr. Waring
was furious at first, and vowed she
shouldn't&mdash;not if he knew himself;
but three days' fussing and fuming
brought him to the conclusion she
might do as she chose, <q>but, for
heaven's sake, never expect him to
love her as much again,</q> and enforced
his resolution by hugging
and kissing her on the spot. Mrs.
Waring was very sad at the aspect
of affairs, but had so long anticipated
it as to be little surprised.
Deeming a refusal of her sanction
worse than useless, she also said
her daughter might do as she pleased.
Only Agathe was inexorable;
for, having begun by condemning
her sister's course, she considered
it incompatible with firmness ever
to change.
</p>

<p>
<q>How you can have allowed
yourself to be so wound about the
little fingers of those priests and
<pb n='853'/><anchor id='Pg853'/>
nuns I can't divine,</q> she cried.
<q>It indicates such contemptible
weakness to turn from the religion
in which you were born to that of
a Papist&mdash;above all things, a Papist!
Were I to live a hundred years, I
could not do it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, my poor sister,</q> thought
Kathleen; <q>with all your character,
I fear you have not the daring courage
required to combat the distress
of parents, the anger of friends, the
loss of a beloved object. No; it is
a precious gift of God, and must be
prayed for.</q>
</p>

<p>
Next Kathleen wrote to Mr. Lee,
informing him of all that had taken
place, of her intention to become a
member of the Catholic Church in a
few weeks, and renewed her request
that he would forgive the pain she
had caused him in remembering the
grief she herself endured; with many
wishes for his future prosperity, she
remained his true friend. No answer
came to this at all, and the
Warings saw nothing more of
Howard Lee. Delicacy prevented
their asking an explanation from
Kathleen, and, as she proffered
none, his name was never mentioned
among them.
</p>

<p>
The days passed on, and Kathleen,
being at last considered sufficiently
instructed, had prevailed
on the Sisters of Trinità di Monte
to allow her retreat to be made
with them, and her baptism and
first communion to take place in
their church. Christmas was the
time appointed for the consummation
of Kathleen's desire. The
chapel had been beautifully decorated
by the nuns and girls; and
a little Bethlehem, removed some
slight distance from the altar, was
the emblem of the glorious feast.
A new Mass had been learned,
and, while the organ pealed forth
its first tones, the white-robed
girls filed in, followed by Mr. and
Mrs. Waring and Agathe, who, by
dint of persuasion, had been induced
to appear on the occasion.
Last entered Kathleen, and knelt
in front of the altar. She was faint
and trembling, but did not lose a
syllable of the words that made her
a Christian, a Catholic, and soldier
of heaven. She was baptized, of
course, before the celebration of
Mass, and during it received for
the first time the Holy Communion.
Mr. Waring seemed much moved,
his wife cried outright, and Agathe's
flushed face and shining eyes
belied the unconcern she tried so
hard to assume.
</p>

<p>
No one noticed the tall, dark figure
standing in the furthest corner
of the church, nor saw the gaze
riveted upon the fair, sweet girl at
the altar. As everything here must
have an end, so did the music, the
lights, all that had brightened the
chapel. The dark figure had hurried
away, the girls in white had
disappeared, the Warings were
gone; only the little Babe of Bethlehem
still lay in the manger, and
one lamp shed its faint lustre in
honor of that Blessed Sacrament
which is for you, for me, for all
who but seek it.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the same day
Kathleen was playing soft chords
on the piano, and indulging in
waking dreams, when she was
greatly disturbed by the entrance
of a man bearing in his arms a
huge package of something very
delicate, to judge from the care
with which said package was deposited
on the table. Before Kathleen
could frame a question concerning
the matter the man was
gone. Approaching the very remarkable
bundle, she perceived
a card suspended bearing these
words:
</p>

<pb n='854'/><anchor id='Pg854'/>

<p>
<q>A Christmas gift for Miss K.
Waring.</q>
</p>

<p>
Still wondering, she gently detached
the paper cover, and there, delighting
her eyes, was a tiny Christmas-tree
literally filled with bon-bons,
colored candles, and children's
toys, while two or three small papers
concealed some more valuable presents
no doubt. In perfect amazement
she ran to the door and called
father, mother, and sister, who,
hastening to the room, uttered exclamations
of pleasure at the sight.
The candles were instantly lighted,
and the tree admired from every
point, though a thorough mystification
ensued as to the donor. Each
surmise only seemed to make the
matter worse; so they instituted a
search among the separate parcels.
The first opened displayed a gold
locket with the initials A. W. in pinheads
of pearls; the next contained
a handsome silver tobacco-box for
Mr. Waring; the next, a musical
work-box with Mrs. Waring's
name; yet still there was nothing
for Kathleen. More astonished
than ever, they examined once
again; and right on the very top of
the tree, buried deep in its branches,
was a round pasteboard box about
the size of a lady's watch. Being
opened, it disclosed a knot of hard-twisted
note-paper, which Kathleen
unwrapped and unfolded until she
came upon an old, worn medal of
the Immaculate Conception, from
which hung a blue ribbon. As the
paper in her hand had something
written on it, she made haste to read,
and here is the secret:
</p>

<p>
<q>Will my dear one take for a
Christmas gift the little medal herein
enclosed, which was put around
my neck by my mother when I
made my first communion eighteen
years ago? I have kept away
from you, that you might have a
pleasant surprise for this Christmas
day, though I went to communion
for you this morning, and also saw
the triumph of your brave spirit in
the Church of the Trinità di Monte.
If, when I come to you this evening,
my little medal is about your neck,
I shall know you accept me as your
devoted <hi rend='smallcaps'>Howard Lee</hi>.</q>
</p>

<p>
Kathleen stood looking at the
words through gathering tears, and
was not conscious of the quiet withdrawal
of her parents and sister
until the door opened gently to admit
Howard, who, glancing quickly
at the blue ribbon on her bosom,
advanced eagerly, and, bending
low, exultantly murmured:

The late Bishop Grant was remarkable
for learning, ability, and sanctity. The
events of his life, both before and after
the period of his ordination, are interesting.
As rector of the English College
in Rome, and as bishop, his administration
was successful and filled with great
services to the Catholic Church in England,
particularly in respect to the re-establishment
of the regular hierarchy.
The story of his life is told in a lively
and pleasing manner, and the publisher
has issued the volume in a style which
makes it attractive, though somewhat
costly. The author, whose <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>nom de plume</foreign>
is Grace Ramsay, is one of the best of
our English Catholic writers. We have
been indebted to her graceful pen for
some of the most agreeable articles in
our magazine, and we are pleased to learn
that some remarks in <hi rend='smallcaps'>The Catholic
World</hi> on the character of the late illustrious
Bishop of Southwark first suggested
to her the idea of writing his
biography.

This tiny and pretty little book costs
only fifty cents. We make its small size
and price thus prominent, in order to
encourage those who have not money or
time to bestow on large books to buy
this one and to help its circulation. It
contains the substance of the larger
biographies of a saint who has done one
of the most wonderful works of modern
times, and has become justly the object
of an extraordinary devotion among the
faithful.
</p>

<p>
The devotion to the Sacred Heart of our
Lord has become the great devotion of
our day, to the incalculable benefit of the
church and the promotion of the most
solid piety among the faithful. Pius IX.
has constituted himself the Superior-General
of the Congregation of Missionaries
of the Sacred Heart, and has expressed
to several of its members his desire to
consecrate the universal church to the
Adorable Heart of our Lord, if he is asked
to do it. We trust that the petition to
the Holy See will not long be delayed,
and that it will be made in such a way
as to show most conclusively how ardent
is the sympathy of the members of the
church with their august head in his
pious sentiments. It is most natural
that all who love this devotion should
desire to know something of the favored
recluse of Paray-le-Monial who was chosen
by our Lord as the medium of his revelation,
making known his will that it
should be universally promulgated and
cherished. There can be no doubt of the
real, supernatural, and divine character
of the extraordinary graces conferred
upon her for this intention. The Sovereign
Pontiff, in his Decree of Beatification,
declares that <q>whilst she devoted
herself day and night to continuous
prayer, being often rapt in ecstasy, the
gifts of divine grace were most plenteously
showered upon her</q> (p. 89).
Again, that <q>it was now, as she was praying
before the august Sacrament of the Eucharist,
that Christ our Lord intimated to
her that it would be most pleasing to him
if the worship of his most Sacred Heart,
burning with love for mankind, were established,
and that he wished the charge of
this to be consigned to her</q> (p. 90). When
the Pope speaks in this manner, and the
most learned and holy bishops, theologians,
and other sound and judicious
Catholic writers everywhere re-echo, amplify,
and confirm by solid reasoning and
evidence the calm and cautious statements
of the supreme authority, hesitation,
criticism, and doubt are out of place.
Infidels and heretics may scoff; we expect
them to do it. But devout Catholics
do not need to wait for a positive
<pb n='856'/><anchor id='Pg856'/>
command under pain of sin in order to
believe readily and joyously; and to let
their hearts take fire with the devotion
that burns everywhere among the faithful,
kindled by a spark from heaven
which fell into a virgin bosom, and has
been communicated from her, under the
fanning of the wings of the divine Dove,
until it has enkindled the whole world.
We trust the time may soon come when
the canonization of the Blessed Margaret
Mary will give to the whole church the
privilege of celebrating Mass in her
honor, and make her day a universal
feast.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, we welcome and
most earnestly recommend the little
book of F. Garside, and wish for it the
widest possible circulation.

<hi rend='smallcaps'>The Spiritual Conflict and Conquest.</hi>
By Dom J. Castaniza, O. S. B. Edited
with Preface and Notes by Canon
Vaughan, Monk of the English Benedictine
Congregation. Reprinted from
the Old-English translation of 1652.
London: Burns &amp; Oates. 1874. (New
York: Sold by The Catholic Publication
Society.)

</quote>

<p>
Vast numbers of Catholics have read
the treatise which in English has been
known by the title of <hi rend='italic'>The Spiritual Combat</hi>,
and has been widely circulated in
many other languages besides the Italian,
from which the English translation was
made. It has been always attributed to
F. Scupoli, a Theatine, who in reality
only translated and adapted it, with alterations
and additions, from the Spanish of
Dom Castaniza, a Benedictine who lived
at the same time with S. Teresa. In this
altered form it has been generally esteemed
as second only to the <hi rend='italic'>Imitation of
Christ</hi>, which, by the bye, has lately been
conclusively proved not to be the work
of Thomas à Kempis, Gerson, or any
other writer to whom its authorship has
been ascribed. The complete work of
Dom Castaniza, which was translated
into English in 1652, is now once more
brought to light, and republished in the
most perfect manner, with a preface and
notes, increasing its value very considerably,
by a member of the remarkable
Vaughan family, a brother, we presume,
of our illustrious and highly-honored
friend, the Bishop of Salford. We are
disposed to regard this treatise in its
present complete form as decidedly the
best spiritual guide in the English language
for the great majority of devout
Catholics. This is very high praise, but
it is, in our opinion, not exaggerated.
Let our readers examine for themselves,
and we are inclined to think they will
find our judgment correct.
</p>

<p>
We ought to say that even now, as it
stands, a considerable portion of the
first part of the book is made up of Scupoli's
additions. In the main, we have no
fault to find with the translation. We
like that old-fashioned, terse, strong
English which is found in Old English
writers. But it is sometimes rude and
even coarse, and in the present work
there are a few passages which are revolting
to the more correct modern taste,
and which therefore become really irreverent.
</p>

<p>
The <hi rend='italic'>Month</hi> has a very severe, though,
as is always the case in that periodical,
a courteous and polite, <foreign rend='italic'>critique</foreign> on the preface
and notes of Canon Vaughan. It
accuses him of boasting too much of his
order, and of <q>girding</q> at other people.
We have looked through the book
with this criticism in our hand, and we
must say that we find it overstrained.
We cannot see any evidence that Canon
Vaughan is disposed to undervalue other
orders different from his own, or that his
remarks upon methods of direction
used in other societies are intended to
censure anything except indiscretion and
exclusiveness in their application.

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Grapes and Thorns.</hi> By M. A. T., Author
of <hi rend='italic'>The House of Yorke</hi>. New

1874.
</p>

</quote>

<p>
Another story from the pen of the author
of <hi rend='italic'>The House of Yorke</hi>. Turning as
the interest of the tale does on the discovery
of a criminal in whose stead an
innocent man is imprisoned and actually
condemned, it is yet so skilfully conducted
that none of the disgusting realistic
details of what is known as the sensational
school are brought in to mar the
work. It really is a case of touching
pitch, and yet not being, in a literary
sense, defiled. The circumstantial evidence
on which the supposed murderer
is condemned is very well managed, and,
until the facts are thrust upon the reader,
there is no chance of his discovering the
real criminal. This is a very great attainment
in novel-writing, and, in this
day of hackneyed <q>situations,</q> one very
seldom reached. It is difficult nowadays
<pb n='857'/><anchor id='Pg857'/>
to take up any book, especially one
referring to such events as are treated in
<hi rend='italic'>Grapes and Thorns</hi>, without at once seeing
through the conventional skeleton of the
story, and picking out the main points in
it beforehand. As to style, we can only
say of this book what all the literary
world said of <hi rend='italic'>The House of Yorke</hi>&mdash;that it
alone would recommend even the flimsiest
web of story. The author has, in addition
to this rare charm of style, a faculty,
so far as we know peculiar to herself
among current novelists, of investing
with poetical grace the most commonplace
things of every-day life, even such
hopelessly prosaic subjects as the engine
and engine-driver of a night-train, and,
worse still, a grocer's shop and a palette
full of syrups! The descriptions of
Rome are a feature of the book, but so
are the delineations of New England
scenery, in snow-storm and autumn glories
as well as in its summer dress of
fresh greenery and moistness, which is so
delicately sketched in the picture of the
Pond farm, the water-lilies, and the strong,
beautiful young boat-woman.
</p>

<p>
But to come to the chief point, the
characters; for of the story itself we say
nothing, hoping that every reader of this
notice has either read the book or will
immediately do so. Annette is unquestionably
the only heroine of the tale, although
in the beginning one may be induced
to consider the beautiful, conscientious,
high-principled Honora Pembroke
as entitled to that place of honor.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gerald is another well-drawn female
character in the story. The most
touching thought in the whole story is
contained in her gentle words after she
has found her son's footsteps on the fresh
mould of the violet-bed under her window:
<q>I mean to sow little pink quill
daisies in those two foot-prints.... When
they come back, the tracks will be green.</q>
Anita, the little convent-flower, is a very
beautiful conception; she is like one of
the ethereal angels of Fra Angelico, not
a common mortal. Mrs. Ferrier is the
very reverse, but her generous championship
of Max Schöninger goes far to redeem
the vulgarity that shocks one in
the early part of the book, where she constitutes
herself spy over Lawrence's actions,
and lectures him to the verge of
insanity.
</p>

<p>
We have now mentioned the name of
the hero of the story, Schöninger, the
Jewish musician, on whom falls the false
accusation of murder. His character is
all but faultless, the only exceptions, perhaps,
being his rather uncontrolled and
fierce burst of joy when released from his
seven months' imprisonment, and his
general attitude towards F. Chevreuse.
The latter is more excusable than the
former; but if the hero of a book were
faultless, he would be unnatural as a
man. Schöninger is a wonderful conception;
so self-reliant, self-contained,
and yet not harsh, not repulsive even, in
his defiance. The opinion of the world
is nothing to him; he has his own standard
of right and wrong, and he lives up
to it; he would think martyrdom a trifle,
if endured for the truth; he sees straight
to the core of things, and will be as uncompromising
a Christian after his conversion
as he was an earnest Jew before
it. We think, however, that the author
has made a mistake in making him a
Reformed Jew. Doubtless it was meant
to enable him to parade the superior
spirituality which was the only form of
religion possible for such a man; but the
<hi rend='italic'>Reformed</hi> Jews are no nearer to a high
spiritual standard, as contrasted with the
orthodox Jews, than the Lutheran or
Calvinist sects are as contrasted with the
true Church. They are mere secessionists
from the old faith, and, like all
branches divided from the parent trunk,
are more or less withering into atheism
and infidelity. An orthodox Jew is much
more likely to be converted to Catholicity
than a Reformed Jew.
</p>

<p>
F. Chevreuse is a very beautiful character,
especially after the scene in Lawrence's
room, where the priest and his
penitent are alone with their solemn secret,
and face to face with God. Some
one once said of <hi rend='italic'>The House of Yorke</hi>
that there was an undefinable <q>something</q>
wanting in the character of the
priest of that story, and that doubtless it
was not given to any one to be able to
delineate truly a perfect priest. Perhaps
it is so, for it is most difficult to portray
a life in which the supernatural mingles
with and effaces the natural to such an
extent as it does in the life of a true
priest; but in F. Chevreuse the author
has gone as near to the ideal as any one
could well go. Lawrence Gerald is a
very difficult character to analyze&mdash;a peculiar
product of American civilization
(this assertion would be very hard to
prove categorically, but every one who
has read the book will understand what
<pb n='858'/><anchor id='Pg858'/>
we mean); a man for whom our feelings
change, during the progress of the tale, to
a degree that almost gives him at the
last the moral pre-eminence which at the
beginning would have been difficult to
award even to saintly F. Chevreuse.
Truly, in his case, as he himself says,
<q>Nothing but utter ruin could have
brought him to his senses.</q> There are
souls whose salvation God works in this
way, and Lawrence's penance certainly
reads like some biography of a mediæval
sinner gradually turning into the
life of a grand saint. The human element
is not absent, either, in this picture,
of a most unusual expiation, and no
scene in the book will be read with more
emotion than that of the artist sketching
the sleeping Lawrence, and adding, at the
eager suggestion of the <q>woman under
the arch,</q> the <q>cluster of yellow flowers
which touched his head in the form of a
crown.</q> We venture to say that nothing
short of the influence of a sojourn at
Rome and the personal contact with a
life of exuberant, all-pervading Catholicity,
such as that of the Italians, could
have suggested such a remarkable ending
to Lawrence's career. Of the subordinate
characters of <hi rend='italic'>Grapes and Thorns</hi>&mdash;John, the
shrewd, hard, honest footman; Jane, the
faithful but exasperating housekeeper of
F. Chevreuse; Dr. Porson, the Crichton
cynic and man of the world; F. O'Donovan,
the fast friend at need of his brother-priest;
Mother Chevreuse, the bright,
tender, brave woman, of whom we get
but a glimpse; Sister Cecilia, a counterpart
of Honora&mdash;we can only say that
they show the varied acquaintance of the
author with many and widely different
types of mankind. The pettiness and
prejudice of <q>liberal</q> Crichton are well
defined in the hue-and-cry which soon
follows Schöninger's arrest, and the equally
intemperate revulsion in his favor
when he is proved innocent. It is remarkable
that no one but F. Chevreuse
and Mrs. Ferrier believed firmly in his
innocence while circumstances all pointed
so suspiciously to him as the murderer,
except, of course, those who already
knew the miserable secret.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the great merits of this
story, it has, nevertheless, like <hi rend='italic'>The House
of Yorke</hi>, one great defect which mars its
excellence, not perhaps as a work of art,
but as a specimen of the Catholic ideal
in art. Annette, the heroine, acts foolishly,
unreasonably, and against the sense
of personal dignity and worth which the
perfect Christian maiden must cherish, as
next to her faith and honor, in marrying
the unhappy Lawrence Gerald. This
shows that the author's ideal woman is
not the highest type of her sex, and that
she fails to appreciate the lofty, Christian
idea of conjugal love and of marriage.
Honora Pembroke ought to have
been the heroine, and although she has
not been fortunate enough to win the
sympathy of critics and readers generally,
especially of the fair sex, we are
glad to see that the author has given us
at least one specimen of a woman who is
governed by conscience and reason, and
not by sentiment.
</p>

<p>
Another fault, against which we beg
leave here to caution all our writers of
light articles and stories for the magazine,
is the introduction of the writer's
private and personal opinions on matters
connected with religion and the
church. We request, once for all, that
such matters may be left to the editor of
the magazine and those whom he judges
competent to treat of them expressly.

<p>
This is a story quite romantic and sensational
in its character, but withal very
pious, and showing very dramatically
high virtue in contrast with great wickedness,
and triumphing over it. In one
part of it Amelia makes a promise which
a Catholic could not make without grievous
sin. She promises, namely, her supposed
parents, who were Protestants, that
<pb n='859'/><anchor id='Pg859'/>
if they will listen to a discussion between
a priest and a minister, she will embrace
their religion, provided they declare their
conviction that the minister has the best
of it. The use of the word <q>Catholicism</q>
to express the Catholic religion,
though sometimes allowable, is awkward
and unsuitable as it occurs in the story.
Critically speaking, this story is not
much, but it may amuse children, who
are generally not very critical if there
are plenty of remarkable incidents to excite
their emotions. There are hosts of
stories like this in the French language,
many of which are much better. It is a
pity that more care and taste are not
sometimes shown in selecting among

<p>
A dramatic poem by Aubrey de Vere
could not be other than noble in theme
and thoughtful and delicate in execution.
Almost alone among the poets of the day,
not many of whom equal, and not one of
whom surpasses, him in the higher qualities
of insight and subtle imagination, he
seems never to have felt the debasing
touch of that materialism which in one
department of letters seeks to elevate
science at the expense of faith, and in
another to degrade poetry to be the beautiful
but shameless minister to all that is
lowest in man's nature. Religion, which
he has served so faithfully, has rewarded
his devotion by lifting him into a clearer
atmosphere than can be breathed by men
devoid of faith, and has made him worthy
to be ranked with those true poets who
sing not alone for the busy, itching ears
of their contemporaries, but for a wider,
because a more enduring, audience.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, Mr. de Vere's lyric poetry,
subtle and delicate as it is, could
hardly, we should say, have prepared his
readers for the power shown in his conception
and delineation of the hero of his
drama, Alexander, the greatest of the
great conquerors whom the world has
seen. His poem is absolutely simple in
aim and in detail, and gains interest, if
not solely, yet almost solely, from the
manner in which he has strongly though
briefly expressed his idea of what a great
conqueror, a man with aims truly imperial,
swayed by no mean passion, and filled
with the idea of welding into one all
peoples, and informing them by the highest
purely human intelligence, should be.
What literal truth there is in the picture&mdash;how
nearly the Alexander of the play resembles
him who died at thirty-three, the
master of half the world&mdash;is not a question
of any special interest. It is enough that
Mr. de Vere's hero is a noble and intrinsically
true conception, and a fit measure
by which to estimate the true proportions
of those lesser men whom the world once
in an age sees filled with the lust of empire,
but void of the skill and quick insight
which should make them avoid its
perils. In his play, indeed, Mr. de Vere,
who follows the tradition of Josephus,
and makes Alexander visit once the temple
at Jerusalem, and pay to its high-priest
such reverence as he had never
shown to mortal man, makes him listen
there to the warning that his power must
have its <q>term and limit,</q> and that he
who would indeed wear the world's
crown <q>should be the Prince of Peace.</q>
And yet the errors and mistakes by
which great men seem blindly to throw
away at last the fruits of their long toil
seem to the on-looker as if they might
have been so easily avoided that it is always
necessary to remind one's self how
little is truly in the power of man, and
how surely God controls even the crimes
and follies of those who seem to rule the
world.
</p>

<p>
Aside, however, from the fine scenes
in which Mr. de Vere brings out his idea
of his hero, the play has many subsidiary
beauties of a different kind.
</p>

<p>
What poet but himself could have
written the two lovely scenes between
Hephestion and Arsinoë, and made his
<pb n='860'/><anchor id='Pg860'/>
readers see so well the love which either
felt, but of whose return neither was
aware? The minor characters, indeed,
are drawn throughout with the hand of a
master who never wastes a stroke, and
who has the art of showing his readers
what he wills by lifting them and not by
lowering himself. Who has painted in
our day a lovelier picture than that in
which Hephestion shows us Arsinoë's
mother?

<p>
Some qualities of Mr. de Vere's work,
which are more generally known than the
virile force displayed in his grasp of the
characters of his play, are shown at their
best in the two or three lyrics which
occur in it. Let us end an inadequate
notice, which may send our readers to the
poem itself, by quoting his exquisite paraphrase
of one of the most beautiful of
the Psalms:
